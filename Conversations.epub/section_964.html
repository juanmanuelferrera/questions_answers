<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> 7-UP? We'll have to send someone out for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so far I was there, it was successful. What was the next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were selling <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> I think we must have made somewhere between five and ten thousand dollars so far from <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> sales. That's in addition to the free feast. We served a free feast to five thousand people when I left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you did not stay there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, still, it's so big. I estimated that through three to four hours there were thirty to forty thousand people that went in and out of that park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still they are eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're still eating. Every piece of <span class="Italic">burfi</span> we sold cost one dollar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just a piece of <span class="Italic">burfi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Burfi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, they were charging one dollar for one square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they were paying. Watermelon, for one slice, half a dollar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty cents. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty cents. The whole watermelon only cost one dollar. We got about thirty slices out of it. And books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People, they are simple here. They are not, about money matters, so much attracted. They have got enough money. They don't care. They want it is good taste, that's all. And why they did not give <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to that boy who was crazy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He got. I'm sure he must have gotten. Everybody was given free feast. Feast was very good. I tasted it, nicely prepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many preparations were there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Very hard to estimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many preparations in the feast? There was <span class="Italic">halavā, sabji,</span> very good <span class="Italic">sabji</span> by Ṛṣi Kumāra, rice, sweet, lemonade, popper-six preps. And <span class="Italic">puri,</span> seven preps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. Very good preps, sumptuous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Oh, yes. Besides that, we had booths with watermelon, <span class="Italic">lassi</span> and <span class="Italic">burfi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Lassi</span> was selling very big. We could not supply it fast enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We could not... All the time, those booths, there was a line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because this was our first year, we were not expecting such a big turnout, so we did not have sufficient stands to meet everybody's needs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the police officer has approved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the policemen sat down at the end of the park later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You gave them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm not sure. I didn't deal with them. They were dealt with by Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa. We'll bring them some present tomorrow. But they made the statement that "If every parade was so beautiful and so nicely orderly, we would be very happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said it was very orderly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that cannot be expected from any other group, only in this group. Such a huge crowd, and there was not a single instance of violence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Except that one tie. One boy was punched out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (referring to 7-UP) I sent someone out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The procession was very well attended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Oh, yes, ABC, CBS, and Channel Five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of the GBC men said it was the biggest single festival ever held in ISKCON's history. They all admitted that there was no festival ever held anywhere, even in India, no single festival in India. There was not any one day at any <span class="Italic">pandal</span> where there was that many people who took <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and who attended such a long procession for two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in the beginning... (microphone rattling) You were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was there. Yeah, that was pretty big. In 1969, that was gigantic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was also very big. And there was also a crazy man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's right. We didn't give any invitation cards to our temple here, but we were making announcements. But I think people will come, anyway. They'll find out where our Hare Kṛṣṇa center is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They were distributing books, magazines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Books and magazines were given, but we didn't give any free cards. Usually we give free cards, but there was so much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? They'll come and take. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They'll come here, anyway. We didn't give any address card. Do you think people will come anyway?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even without getting a card.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is better, to give a card. Many Indians were standing when I came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Did you see the Indians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think at least three thousand Indians attended, minimum. A huge crowd of Indians, but the big thing was not the Indians, it was the American people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a good location for the festival, very important place, Washington Square Park. It's the center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best thing would have been to keep the Deities for a week there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would not have been permitted. They only permitted us legally two hours for everything. That's why we were rushing everything. We only had two hours legally for the whole program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then there is no need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard people say "We've never seen such a festival, never seen such a parade." I heard these comments. One man said... Someone said, "What's going on?" and he said, "Oh, they have so many things going on here." They were very appreciative. And actually we could not put our full energy into it this year because we were so busy preparing the building simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And above all, the atmosphere, the weather, was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Oh, yes, Kṛṣṇa has blessed us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) The breeze was there. We did not feel any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No discomfort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...fatigue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And there was nearly four hundred to five hundred devotees there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will stay in the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they've been staying here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's no difficulty to accommodate them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Nārāyaṇa told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You know, Prabhupāda, I really feel like I should concentrate lot of my preaching here in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Preaching is required, here or there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You once said, "A good businessman, if he knows how to do it, he can make more money sitting in one place..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Money is not our aim. Our aim is how people will understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He is just using that as an analogy for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That if you have a good place, many people can be attracted, as many as moving around to many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My Guru Mahārāja was in favor of preaching in the city because you can get many men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But do you think I should travel a lot, or what is the best thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both things should be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Both. So if you... We were hoping that you could give us another chance by coming back next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, I'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you do say that to a lot of different temples, but we will try to make this doubly big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Always, so long I live, I must come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we get on Fifth Avenue, you'll come again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we will double the amount of people, promise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> And double the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We will double everything if you are here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. I can stay here also. I like especially New York, because I started the movement here. And because there are so many branches, if I go they become enlivened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, right, just like we are enlivened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone wants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone wants you to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> New York was your second home after India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I say fatherland. India, motherland; this is fatherland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It is so nice that now in New York they are receiving you so nicely, this parade. Everyone is turning out to greet you. You are like the local boy who made good. So now they are receiving you very grandly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, continue this program. People will be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was thinking that we could make a point to have many big festivals here each year, not just this one, but many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, at least three, four you can do. On <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī,</span> one; <span class="Italic">Gaura Pūrṇimā</span>; for <span class="Italic">Śrī Rāma-navamī;</span> and one, Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We can do New York for the spring, summer and fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Because the weather is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That coincides. <span class="Italic">Rāma-navamī</span> is spring, Ratha-yātrā is summer, and <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī</span> is fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Gaura Pūrṇimā</span> would be a bit difficult, though. Everybody is in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We could do that inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But those three...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī,</span> take Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa procession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On carts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, on <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana,</span> carried by hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Palanquin; no, the <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana</span> as it is. Just like this is <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana,</span> two big poles down, and tie it with..., cut it with legs and carry, four men or eight men change. Change the soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But not on carts, not on big chariots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Chariot, only Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll make a big advertisement. We'll call it "Fall Festival." This festival, we called it "Summer Festival." People respond to that. If you say Ratha-yātrā, they can't even pronounce the word. So we call it "Summer Festival," and they came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Summer Festival" sounds very attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone was saying, "Oh, that means for me, Summer Festival."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Ecstasy Outdoors."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Jayānanda should be congratulated. Yes. Give one letter, written. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The carts looked magnificent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two people worked the hardest Prabhupāda, Jayānanda and all of his assistants, and Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa. He did all of the publicity and advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be congratulated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These two men, they worked the hardest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They worked for two months in a row, solid. The carts were very good, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very nice, very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because you gave him that warning. When he heard that, oh, he became very... "I must do it right." We told him, "Now you will have to be replaced. Prabhupāda has said that 'Jayānanda's wheels will never hold up.' So we have to find a replacement for you." So he took no chances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> San Francisco it also happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seems to me that he must be a great devotee of Lord Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing happened in London also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really? The legs, wheels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's why they gave difficulty, the authorities, because the wheels broke?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is wrong idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that happened, though. I remember hearing about it. This Jayānanda, it seems, must be a very faithful devotee of Lord Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, where these things will be kept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In our garage. No problem. That's one of the advantages of our garage. It's one block away and it has ten thousand square foot of area, so we can store all the carts easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Good storage is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And one block away in Manhattan is very unusual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Be careful that termite may not attack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. I'll make a note.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There are not many termites in New York. We are fortunate. In Hawaii there are many termites. But here you don't usually have to protect wood against termites. Here the wintertime kills them. It gets so cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That kills them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There were devotees from Miami, Gainesville, Atlanta, Washington, Baltimore, Boston, Detroit, Toronto, Montreal, Los Angeles, Vancouver, South America-all over South America, I think. A gigantic turnout of devotees. Very international group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> This could be like Lord Caitanya used to invite all His devotees to come and see Him at Ratha-yātrā...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Similarly, if you come here, we can invite...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> ...from all the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Then you do not have to travel so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we will make all arrangements. This year is nothing. Next year we will make ten times more arrangements if you come, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From anywhere, I'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We will make all arrangements for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This was only a trial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We have to perfect it now. We have learned that many..., certain things did not go as perfectly as they could have, so now we are going to repair and make it perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, by this, Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is advertised. Apart from all over the world, at least in New York it is, that "There is some movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prominent movement. Fifth Avenue. We were in charge of Fifth Avenue for one day. Practically we were controlling the Fifth Avenue today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Lord Jagannātha was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If that side we get some small house, so that after going, eight days Jagannātha can remain there and festival going on, and then in the next week return...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How small a house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to keep Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, there's your old storefront.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about your old storefront, 26 Second Avenue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is too small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Too small. I'll immediately get a house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then you can utilize it for other purposes during the whole year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we can keep a downtown center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> West Village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a first-class place for a center, the West Village. We can make many devotees there. We'll keep a small preaching center, maybe a restaurant, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We'll call it the Guṇḍicā center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Guṇḍicā. We will call it Guṇḍicā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Guṇḍicā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we should have a restaurant there, because a restaurant brings in a lot of people. No Deities. We won't install any Deities, just a preaching center, book distribution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, book distribution, restaurant, pictures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, lectures three times a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Records, pictures, yes, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew! I wish that you could stay here all the time, Prabhupāda, because you could give us so many ideas, and we would simply act on them. If somehow we could convince you to stay here... I wish there was a way. There is no way to keep you here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have no objection, but the others... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Just like the Marwaris say, "Oh, I have no objection, but my brother, he may have objection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... Nobody has objection. Simply I am thinking that if I stay in one place and do not see the others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But this is a very central location.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I shall consider.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They may come here. We will make... We have guest rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can make an airline office by which they'll get a reduced rate, and they can travel here, travel agency, and they can come here very inexpensively to visit you, and we can give full accommodations. If somehow we can keep you here, we will do anything required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> At least for a few months. That is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> During the summertime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> July?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> July, August.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because now it is the rainy season in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Because we do not want to inconvenience you as far as the weather goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I know now, June, even July, August, September now in India is not so good. October is very good in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> September is very pleasant in New York. I think you remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These months are very nice. Somehow, if there was some way... I mean, we would preach so hard. At least sixteen hours a day we could work to serve you. I know I would not want to rest even. There must be some way that we can convince you to stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Because actually when you come here, you are preaching to millions. These reporters that have come, through them you have been preaching to millions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about the reporters? They have published something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The transcripts have been sent to them, so within the next week they should be coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think one or two were waiting until after Ratha-yātrā to give a report on the festival as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There were a lot of reporters, and they said that next year... They told us next year they're going to have full television cameras. We're going to have to erect a news, er... What is that called? Press, not a table, but a platform where they're going to put their cameras, and their reporters will sit above the whole crowd. They want to cover it, full. They were very amazed to see such a gigantic festival in New York itself. They never imagined such a thing in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Christians cannot organize. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You saw them. The only thing they were carrying was one sign like this. The sign said "Turn or Burn." It means turn to Jesus or burn. Turn or burn, burn in hell. That's their conception of God. Either God or burn in hell. We could give you a good rest here, also, Prabhupāda, because it's very easy to not... If the devotees could see you on Sunday, just like in the old days in Los Angeles... I mean everything could be nicely done, and you could still visit the European centers when you finally return to India. I mean they are not making such a big thing that you couldn't come later on. Oh, boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Good determination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say that Tamāla Kṛṣṇa is very convincing. When he wants to persuade someone, the person must do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, just it would give... There are so many good... Of course, everywhere there are good devotees, but here there are so many strong preachers that if you stay here on the basis that they had to increase their preaching, we would double and triple our preaching. There's no question. We would throw out all considerations of inconvenience to ourselves and simply preach day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Especially New York, the people are ready for it. Like today, they have taken part very nicely. Even the policemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, they're so favorable. Rāmeśvara was commenting. He said he never saw... The climate of the people of New York is unique in America. They are very favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is that man? Where he has gone? 7-UP can be had anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, it's Sunday evening. It's a bit difficult. He has to drive around in a car till he finds somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> 7-UP? You want 7-UP? I can get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I sent Śravaṇānanda out to get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At the Bloopie's they can get it. Rādhāvallabha got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Not a can, though, just in a cup.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But how do they get it into the cup? Buy the whole bottle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bottle or... Bottle or can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> This store has it... They have the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about Ninth Avenue? There's all those shops. (whispering in background about 7-UP)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He already went to get it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the government is going against our movement, then I'll have to stay. There is no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because in that case I'll be hampered in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He'll be what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, now the government has a policy that anyone they do not like, they put him in jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In India. Even that elderly gentleman, Nārāyaṇa, put him in jail. He's so old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The result is that the Congress Party and Indira Gandhi will never be elected anymore. That is sure. Therefore he's postponing election. Now they have lost all their credit. They will never be elected. Congress Party and Indira Gandhi finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They have lost all respectability.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that your preaching here in New York... The thing is the preaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's more important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> In India they pay more attention to the building than to the person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Our building can go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You know, Prabhupāda, we have never... I mean, you started this movement here in New York, but this is the first time that we have a proper facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the last ten years there was no facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda. That's why if you concentrated here, just by your presence, even if you only spoke to a few important gentlemen... We have so many senior men here. We could do wonderful things. Within two or three months we could expand our movement so broadly here in New York, I think the whole country would take note. I really feel that there is a great potential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why I'm not very eager to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is fact. Let me see what Kṛṣṇa desires. The roof is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For open air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very good for massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the view of the river is very healthy. If you can see the river from your house, it is to be understood that quarter is very nice. If you can see sky from your room, then it is understood the room is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, all these things are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can see from the room the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise from the roof. So it is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think also that right now there's a lot of devotees here, so it's a little taxing, but once the festival's over, they will all be returning to their respective centers. It will be much calmer. [break] In the night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not take anything at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Morning, you are drinking milk? Is it...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Those cows are unique, that a cow can give her own weight in milk in eleven days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are selling milk also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In our farm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we make fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if there is more milk, you can sell more, get money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we're getting nearly two thousand dollars a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (7-Up has been brought) Is there ice? He was supposed to get some ice from the kitchen downstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It's cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will open? You open it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> I have just opened it. Is it cold enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We call it in India, lemonade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was the original name, lemonade. Then all these new things, they changed all the names.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It's good for bringing up gas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From my childhood I liked this lemonade. I think it was cost, in our childhood, three paisa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Now I think in India it costs one rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One rupee, twenty paisa. Of course, you get forty paisa back for the bottle, but it's between sixty-five and eighty paisa after you get your money back. When we were travelling in Bhopal, we traveled there in the months of May and June. It was very hot. We were drinking seven bottle a day, every hour. Every hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Lemonade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gargamuni and I, we had to stop. We'd call it Limka. In India it is called Limka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> When Westerners go to India, it is so hot the water just comes out, you know, sweat, all the time. Become dehydrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Apart from that, you can't drink the water in India, so you have to drink Limka or something. It's safer to drink the lemonade than it is to drink the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
