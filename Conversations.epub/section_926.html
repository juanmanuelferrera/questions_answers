<div class="Purp-para">(Prabhupāda is eating.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> ...Deities we have ordered. They will be arriving in two months. Also we have Prabhupāda-Bhaktisiddhānta deities. They will be coming also. We will be the first in America to have Prabhupāda, Bhaktisiddhānta and Sītā-Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. This <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not as good as Keśī dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make it like Keśī dāsa in New Vrindaban. (long pause) Water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...to purchase it? And he has to sell to us. Nobody will purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No. And we have the option secured with a deposit. Otherwise, we would not spend so much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, as soon as possible, you purchase. Six hundred thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Six-fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> We have purchased. In effect, we have already purchased, Prabhupāda. It is ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is just that we have ten years to get more money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi: :</span>It's cheaper to make the payments than to try and buy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Rāmeśvara has not agreed to pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, we do not have to get money from BBT this way. This way we do not have to take loan. It is good, because BBT does not have that much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we need, we supply money to India. Depend on Kṛṣṇa; Kṛṣṇa will supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> That happened just about less than a month ago. Some gentleman who was a Seventh Day Adventist, he became interested and started to call and come by and listened to the philosophy and even listened to your tapes. And then shortly after that he gave a donation of five thousand dollars. We bought with it some chandeliers for Kṛṣṇa's temple for you to see tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five thousand dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't misspend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Not all on chandeliers. Just part of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have a bell system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes, it rings, but you can't hear it in here. It rings in the back quarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The doors you have purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is costly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The other doors were not..., they could not even be locked nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> We got matching doors all the way through your quarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> We are hoping if you like it, you will stay here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I want to stay, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ...cannot. (to Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:) On the other side, it works. This Washington temple actually is one of your oldest centers, but this is the first time you have been able to come when facilities were proper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indians are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They come on the Love Feast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They come to the Sunday feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> They are starting to come more now. With the changes we made in the temple, and they are being very much impressed that we are doing nicely, and they want to become a part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I heard that Ambassador, you have made some engagement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Prabhupāda, he, I got a call from his secretary, and I've been working on it and I've been to his house once. He has a very nice stately house. He had requested that maybe you could come there to his home, and your servant and Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa were thinking it might be hard for you to travel there. So we're trying to convince him to come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. There is no question of insisting. They cannot help us in any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> No, not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have tried all these. They are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> We have written all the Parliament and we have asked them to come, but they are too busy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you go and take rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is much time difference from...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Same time. It is ten-thirty now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, New Vrindaban and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Same time, New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Should I close this, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm going to the bedroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like a fan that doesn't make so much noise perhaps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May be required. (end)</div>
