<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...although it appears that he's very stern. But he's friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The criminal thinks that "Oh, he's my enemy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The criminal thinks, "He's my enemy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [Break] They have achieved their advancement of knowledge by seeing a crack in the moon. You know that? Yes. They are now researching, "What is this crack?" For seeing the crack, they spend so much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They are so foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> When I was in Hawaii I gave a lecture at one Catholic college, and the priest in charge, he was asking me if in our philosophy we believe that animals have a soul. He's so foolish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The Christians are so foolish, even though they have big learned positions, they do not understand that the animal also has a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You told? In that meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What did they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They could not deny. They could not say anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what is the difference that you say the animals...? How do you say? What is the symptoms of possessing soul? The symptoms of possessing soul is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: yena sarvam idaṁ tatam</span>. The consciousness. The animals have no consciousness? How foolish they are!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Just to rationalize their sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. Rational or not rational...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, to rationalize their meat-eating, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to support, yes, their sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can say there is no soul in the animals? What is the reason? What is their reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> At one interview a person said to you, "They do not understand metaphysics, and the human being understands metaphysics."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Metaphysics. A child also does not understand. So therefore he has no soul? Cut him? They are doing that. They are doing that, so rascal. So do everyone understand metaphysics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They should not be killed if they don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They should not be killed just if they don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Is that any reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Actually, they have no philosophical basis for that belief that the animal has no soul. It's just speculation. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No philosophy. Simply rascaldom. Simply rascaldom. And that is being preached by the priestly class. Priestly class. Just see the society! What third-class society! (pause) [break] ...the soul enters after the birth of the child. Eh? Is it not? Therefore killing or abortion is not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, they say that abortion isn't bad because the child is not fully formed and therefore is not really a life. It's not really alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Therefore one man who is sleeping, he has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No one... They do not believe that generally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They admit that they are killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They admit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That they are killing the child. But they do not care. 'Cause they don't want to take the trouble to raise it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Just like the rabbit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rabbit philosophy. So therefore, considering from all points of view, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the best in the world. There is no doubt. You must be convinced about it. Otherwise, how you can preach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Now is a very ripe time to push forward our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Now it is a very ripe time to push forward our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I was thinking of taking a full..., large advertisements in New York Times, present our philosophy so that people can read. Everyone will see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Now, you... Why don't you publish that...? I have suggested that poster.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That poster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We have a poster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's being worked on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I have not seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take contribution from public...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh yeah, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for one day's advertisement. And advertise this poster in every paper. You see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I want to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Also I was thinking to have a large scale propaganda in all the college newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Specifically. To attract...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same, one advertisement. What is the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> "Real leaders of human society."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That... You have seen that design I have given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, I haven't seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is not yet done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, it's being worked on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You can give him the rough idea. That will be very nice propaganda, to select real leaders of the society. The... We are misled by rascal leaders. That is the difficulty, all rascals. If the society is led by real, learned scholars, then it will be nice. Qualified leaders. That is wanted. Leader means better qualified man to lead others. That is leader. Leader does not mean he is himself a fool and leading other fools. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...the poster could have a coupon for <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to find the real solution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So they can purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there are so many. They'll purchase another rascal's <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. Simply you make propaganda that what is real leadership. Then they will inquire and we shall reply. [break] ...so many things. So we may not create any disruption amongst our solidarity. Then things will not make progress. In a big machine, even one screw is slack, the machine stops. You know that? So we should not commit such mistake. "Don't care. It is a small screw." No. Even that small screw can stop the whole machine. [break] ...that we are on the platform of deathlessness. Then we can be careful about falling down. And this is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And we will not want to fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That, that is seriousness. Suppose you are going on a plane to Vaikuṇṭha. So your business should be that you may not fall down. The plane may not stop. It is like that. [break] <span class="Italic">...Bhāgavata,</span> simply this point is being stressed, that "This is the platform of deathlessness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> [break] Where is that boy? No, not... Oh, you. So you are now living in Mexico?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. He's our old student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah, from New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From New York, yes. [Break] ...fall. Simply by following the regulations and chanting. That's all. (end)</div>
