<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...that man, and then Krodha Mahārāja knew that this man would be perhaps hanged by the officials. So the engineer... [break] He was smuggled into Africa. And there, in Africa, he learned Bengali by himself, reading book. And he was Bengali scholar. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was professor of Presidents' College, Calcutta. Their opinion is Sanskrit is the mother of all languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Russian language there are so many Sanskrit words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Deva-nāgarī.</span> In the heavenly planets this language is... Heavenly planet the Sanskrit language is used. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">deva-nāgarī. Nāgara</span> means town, and <span class="Italic">deva</span> means demigod. This language is spoken in the heavenly planets, <span class="Italic">deva-nāgara.</span> But these rascals, they think there is no living entity in any other planet except this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now the scientists have started saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what kind of scientists? They can change their opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then they are learning science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascals, say rascals. No, no, say... Learning means rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) Then we are all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are learning not from rascal; we are learning from the perfect. We may be rascals, but learning is not rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, "we," I said, not learning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they change... "Now the scientists are thinking that"-that means they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but as a matter of fact, they understand this thing from years back, that there should be life on other planets than earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, many scientists say. I was known to one doctor Shaha in Allahabad. He said there are life. There is no question of disbelieving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There's that article that Hayagrīva sent. The title of the article was, "New Discovery Creates Turmoil Amongst Scientists." Some scientists have now discovered some new sub-atomic particles. This has completely created turmoil amongst the scientists. All of their theories now are all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those are elementary particle, smaller than the element, present elementary particles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. And they found a lot of them, so now they don't know what to think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they are trying to search it out by different matter. This ancient... I mean, the Āryans tried to search it out by different matter, by <span class="Italic">yoga-vijñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span><span class="Italic"> Śruti,</span> from the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Veda-pramāṇa. Śruti-pramāṇa </span>That is <span class="Italic">pramāṇa.</span> And nonsense, speculative, that is not <span class="Italic">pramāṇa. </span>That is speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They make some theory, and they become very complacent, that "Oh, now, this is it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Now we are advanced." And next year, again advanced. Next year again advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Real scientists don't think that. You must not believe that. Real scientist says, "This may be like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is their opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How to know who is real and who is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are learning, after all, they are learning. They have not reached that. They are not <span class="Italic">yuktas.</span> They are in the process of getting it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they say there is no God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who says that there is no God? Scientists don't say so. Some of them may be saying. Jagadish Chandra Bose did say so? He was a great scientist. Did he say so? No. If a few scientists say there is no God, that does not mean all the scientists. We are practically all of us, scientists, this architect, this Mr. Joshi, myself. We don't say there is no God. So, sir, don't say that scientists say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you have become Vaiṣṇava, that is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not... Even before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless one becomes Vaiṣṇava...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A real scientist finds God's working in every cell, every atom, every molecule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, our point is unless one has become Vaiṣṇava, he remains a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is your saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the statement of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So anyone who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is a fool, rascal. That' s all. This is the conclusion. We are fool, undoubtedly, but we take the words of Kṛṣṇa. He is not fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) No, but He says, <span class="Italic">ye tu sarvāṇī karmāṇi mayi sannyasya mat-parāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The<span class="Italic"> mat-parāḥ,</span> this is <span class="Italic">mat-parāḥ. </span>Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, we accept it. That is <span class="Italic">mat-parāḥ. Mat-parāḥ</span> means whatever Kṛṣṇa says, accept it. That's all. That is<span class="Italic"> mat-parāḥ. </span>And if I say, "I don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, whether He was existing," that is not<span class="Italic"> mat-parāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But Kṛṣṇa says through so many things. Kṛṣṇa says. Through every leaf, every atom...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...every molecule and every living cell, He says what He is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone, our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what the scientists think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scholars, they think like that, "Kṛṣṇa is fictitious. This <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was imagined," as if Kṛṣṇa speaking and Arjuna hearing, and there was no war as Kurukṣetra. This is their reply. There was no five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Suppose, sir, it may be like that, as they say, but this is an acme of the knowledge. That's all. Even though it may be fabricated, it is the acme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Acme of the knowledge you are taking, but you don't believe the source of knowledge. You are so acme of the knowledge. You don't believe in the source of the knowledge, so where is knowledge? That is darkness. <span class="Italic">Tama and jyoti-</span>two things are there. This material world is <span class="Italic">tama,</span> darkness, because here actually there is no Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is almost absent. And jyoti means there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That we were discussing last night.<span class="Italic"> Taṭastha-śakti. Taṭastha... </span>The <span class="Italic">jīvas</span>, they are in the marginal position between <span class="Italic">tama and jyoti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span><span class="Italic"> Tamas</span> is dark and<span class="Italic"> jyoti</span> is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is between these two things. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">taṭastha</span>, marginal. Sometimes you may be in darkness and sometimes you may be in <span class="Italic">jyoti.</span> That is your position. So those who are accepting Kṛṣṇa's word, they are in <span class="Italic">jyoti. </span>And those who are interpreting Kṛṣṇa in darkness, they are in darkness. Unless one has accepted Kṛṣṇa as He is, he is in darkness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa describing him, <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> That man might have been in the <span class="Italic">jyoti,</span> but he is losing the chance. Therefore he is <span class="Italic">mūḍha, narādhama.</span> He had the chance of understanding Kṛṣṇa, but he is neglecting willfully. Therefore mūḍha naradhāma. Men so much learned? <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ: [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic"> </span>That learning has no meaning. That is another darkness. A person, without being learned, he is thinking, "I am learned." That is another darkness. That is another darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhimānam</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhimānam.</span> A person without knowledge, when he professes to be very learned and intelligent, he is more in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But really, sir, very learned people are very doubtful about their learning, to tell the truth. I had my professor who was a Nobel prize winner in London, and he used to be very doubtful, everything, what he said. "It may be or may not be. Who knows? God only knows," he used to say. So we cannot say that all are in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if God knows, take the words of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That he must be taking I mean, in his own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In his own way he cannot take. (laughter) That is another di... That is another foolishness. You cannot take... No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There are many ways by which to know God, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must take God's word as it is. That is <span class="Italic">jyoti.</span> The same example can be... Just like the sunlight. Sunlight is light. You have to take it as it is. If you want to know wherefrom the light is coming, what is there in the sun, that is beyond your jurisdiction. But light is there. Take it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The scientists will analyze the light and call it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientist is a rascal. How can he go to the sun? How can he go the sun and study sun? Therefore he's a rascal. You simply take: "Light is there from the sun." That's all. You go there or not go there, the light is there. You take it. That's all. It finishes the business. This <span class="Italic">jyoti</span> is called also <span class="Italic">Brahman. Jyoti.</span> So when you understood, want to understand wherefrom this jyoti or light is coming, Kṛṣṇa is replying, <span class="Italic">brahmano aham pratistha. Bas, </span>your knowledge is perfect. Why don't you take it? Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the source of this light."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everything means this also. And particularly, particularly He says, <span class="Italic">brahmaṇo ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā.</span> So this is the easiest method to get knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, <i class="calibre3">brahmaṇo pratiṣṭhāham, brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.54]. How the <span class="Italic">atmā </span>becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take the words of Kṛṣṇa; you become Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means he becomes Brahman. He realizes himself as Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Brahman he is, but the rascal, he is thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian." That is rascaldom. He is Brahman. By origin he is Brahman, but rascal, due to his rascaldom, he is thinking that "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Indian," "I am American." That is rascaldom. Otherwise he's Brahman. So when he gives up this wrong conception of life and accepts that "I am part and parcel of the Supreme Brahman," that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhuta [SB 4.30.20].</span> Otherwise he is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhutaḥ.</span> (aside): Thank you. <span class="Italic">Jīva bhūtaḥ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat:</span> [Bg. 7.5] "These living entities, jīva bhūtaḥ, they are conducting the whole universal affairs."<span class="Italic"> Jīva-bhūtaṁ mahā-bāho yayedaṁ dhāryate. </span>Without <span class="Italic">jīva </span>what is the value? These buildings are constructed because the <span class="Italic">jīvas </span>have taken the material from the matter and done. So everything is like that. Why these trees are there? The <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> have taken the shape of this tree, and it looks beautiful. <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhutam maha-baho yayedam...</span> Everything is like that. So that is <span class="Italic">jīva.</span> So that <span class="Italic">jīva...</span> In the material concept of life the tree is thinking, "I am tree," the dog is thinking, "I am dog," I am thinking, "I am Indian," you are thinking something else. So this is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūta.</span> And when he understands that<span class="Italic"> ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta.</span> Simple thing. <span class="Italic">Ekatvam.</span> <span class="Italic">Ekatvam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span><span class="Italic"> Anupaśyati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span><span class="Italic"> Anupaśyati. </span>That <span class="Italic">ekatvam,</span> when he actually becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ-</span>we understand that all these living entities, we are part and parcel of God, <span class="Italic">paṇḍitaḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">-t</span>hat is <span class="Italic">ekatvam,</span> that "We are all servants." But the rascals are thinking,"I am master."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu </span>means that every one of us, we are servant of God. That is ekatvam. Ekatvam anupaśyati. <span class="Italic">Anu</span> means always. <span class="Italic">Anu</span> means following the authority. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. </span>[break] (Hindi) It is not that something, matter, becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ.</span> No. He is Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He realizes that he is Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was not realizing it then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was realizing he was body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long he thinks himself as the body, he is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhutaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You said very well yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhūtaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">. </span>They are thinking, "Indian, American, brāhmaṇa, śūdra, man, dog, cat, tree." This is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhutaḥ.</span> And when he understands that "I am not these things, I am Brahman," that is <span class="Italic">brahma</span>... Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu begins from this <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> stage. His teaching is completely on the spiritual platform. Therefore people misunderstand us. Because we are speaking from the spiritual platform everything, they cannot understand. It requires practice. <span class="Italic">Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Cetasā nānya-gāminā,</span> that you must have continuous fixing of your mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that... No, I know that. But second line, <span class="Italic">abhyāsa yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya gāminā [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> that "One can understand the <span class="Italic">param puruṣa.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upaiti puruṣam param,</span> like that. So this bhakti-yoga means <span class="Italic">abhyāsa-yoga, </span>practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir,</div>
<div class="Verse">brahma bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then he gets real <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He becomes real <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> when he realizes that he's soul and not body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Till then he is not a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, in the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, </span>He says, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Because everyone is rascal, he is thinking, "I am this body." Arjuna was also thinking, "How shall I kill my other side, my brother, my nephews?" Bodily. Therefore the beginning of spiritual education is to understand that "I am not this body; I am soul." That is the beginning. For so many years people are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but still they are in bodily concept. That is the misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span><span class="Italic"> Mahāmāyā duratyayā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. </span>(dog barking) No, no, no, don't. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span> [break]... concept of life means animals. So just see. In the whole world is going on, nationalism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhramāyān sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhramayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nationalism? We said, there is no such thing as nationalism in the Vedic literature, no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Nationalism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nowadays nationalism is very prominent, and we don't find this nationalism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now they are going to rationalism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rationalism is required, not nationalism. No. This nationalism... The Americans and the Russians, they are enemies and friend only on this principle. Prahlāda Mahārāja was astonished, "What is this enemy and friend?" because he is maha-bhāgavata. This is materialism. This is materialism. (aside:)<span class="Italic"> Jaya. </span>Why one should be treated as enemy and as friend? Everyone is servant of God. [break] He is going on at night also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intelligence is above the mind. Intelligence controls the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> And steady intelligence, that is acquired by hearing? We can keep our intelligence steady by hearing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> But as soon as we stop hearing then the intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is disturbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Then the mind will take over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If the mind is not controlled by intelligence, then it will disturb. Then the senses will be disturbed, agitated. Then you are bound up by <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Unrestricted sense gratification means <span class="Italic">karma-bandhana,</span> bound up by the laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And bound up by the laws of <span class="Italic">karma</span> means repetition of birth and death in different species. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantor dehopapatti [SB </span>3.31.1]. Different bodies means resultant action of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So if you want to save yourself from this resultant action of karma, then the first thing is to control the mind. That is yoga system, to control the mind. But one who has got intelligence, he takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the mind is automatically controlled. <span class="Italic">Yogīnām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatāntarātmanā [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is still higher than the intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> And if he is to control his intelligence by hearing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hearing about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Hearing about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> But if his desire is not steady. For instance, if he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he hears about Kṛṣṇa, everything will be done nicely. <span class="Italic">śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathā kṛṣṇaḥ.</span> Kṛṣṇa will help. And that is natural position, to hear about Kṛṣṇa, to act for Kṛṣṇa, to think of Kṛṣṇa. Then everything is all right. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Therefore chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is the easiest process and genuine, without any failure. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpana-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> When you say "genuine," that means that it works...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real spiritual activity. (aside:) Take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So while one is chanting, he is automatically Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chanting means hearing Kṛṣṇa, and that is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And then acting. The more he chants, his dirty things in the heart becomes cleansed, and he acts for Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So the perfection, then, is to chant constantly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> The perfection of chanting is to be chanting twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Constantly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">. </span>That is the injunction, <span class="Italic">sadā. Sadā </span>means always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Well, if one is not able to do that in the beginning... For instance, if during twenty-four hours...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we are constructing temples. At least you will think, "We are constructing Kṛṣṇa's temple." Because you are habituated to work, work for Kṛṣṇa. Go to sell books. Print books. Type for Kṛṣṇa. This is also the same thing. Because you are accustomed to all these things, so <span class="Italic">nirbandhe kṛṣṇa-sambandha.</span> When it is connected with Kṛṣṇa it is as good as chanting. Therefore we are so much eager. Otherwise there is no need of temple; we can chant anywhere. But that stage is not so easy, like Haridāsa Ṭhākura we can sit down and chant anywhere. That is not possible. Then you'll sleep. Therefore these things are required. Everyone, we are working for this temple. Every one of us, we know that "This temple not for my sense gratification: This is for Kṛṣṇa." So that is important. The police commissioner is thinking, "It is nuisance." Huh? Police commissioner is thinking it is nuisance. But we are not thinking it is nuisance. We are not so fool. The politicians, the police commissioner, they'll think of, "He is my enemy; he is my friend." That is their occupation. They'll never think of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Many people say... When we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa they say, "We chant in our minds. You don't have to chant loudly. You don't have to show off. We chant in our minds. We're always thinking about Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Even Dr. Patel when we sometimes tell him "Please chant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Patel is learning if he says. We haven't got to hear from Dr. Patel but from Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He says <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> twenty-four hours' chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Is it possible to chant within one's mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant means that your tongue must be engaged, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa..." That is chanting. Real chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jihvādau, </span>yes. Chant means you must vibrate your tongue. That is chanting, Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is never said, "You chant within the mind." Where it is said? These are their manufacture to avoid. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Then, when we get into deep discussion, then they say, "Whatever I am working is for Kṛṣṇa. Everything is Kṛṣṇa." So ultimately they admit that actually it is not the person Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In <span class="Italic">bhakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But they are thinking themselves Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Everything is going on for Kṛṣṇa. That is fact. But that is not <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti </span>is different thing. <span class="Italic">Bhakti </span>is <span class="Italic">anukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśilanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. </span>Never says, "Whatever you do, it is everything is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is all right." Never said. <span class="Italic">anukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśilanam.</span> What Kṛṣṇa accepts, that is bhakti. Kṛṣṇa accepts... Everyone is thinking... That is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto. </span>That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. So "Everything is Kṛṣṇa," that is all right, but when you think particularly of Kṛṣṇa, that is<span class="Italic"> bhakti.</span> Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Now it may say everybody had.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Kṛṣṇa's (indistinct) to serve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They'll chant, such politician, "Jinna-bhai! Jhinna-bhai!" They will chant like that, (laughter) rascals. But as soon as you ask them, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," "No, it can be done within the mind." (laughter) Just see their rascaldom. For some "Jhinna-bhai," for a dead leader, "Jhinna-bhai," as if he will come to life. (laughter) You see, this nonsense is going on. And as soon as you, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," "We can do it within mind." Therefore they're all rascals, <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> [break] ...never do the right thing. Always commit mistake and suffer. [break] <span class="Italic">Guru-mukha-padma-vākya</span> **.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Prabhupāda, why we have chosen this sixteen as a number to chant the rounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Why not less or more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have fixed up sixteen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> We are chanting sixteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We say "Minimum sixteen." Minimum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Why that sixteen minimum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can, sixteen thousand you can go. Sixteen rounds is the minimum. But if you are able to chant sixteen thousand rounds, that is welcome. We have got so much engagement. Still, we say, "We don't find engagement." This is our misfortune. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Haridāsa Ṭhākura was engaged in chanting and the prostitute came. She offered, "Let us enjoy." "Yes, let me finish. Let me finish this chanting." So much engagement, and still, we say, "No engagement." He refused to have sex with a beautiful young girl because he had engagement. "First of all let me finish my engagement," and we say we have no engagement. How unfortunate we are. [break] ...says, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Some devotees have fixed different number than sixteen. Some are chanting twenty minimum or twenty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It should be increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Is it recommended for our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But don't decrease. Don't decrease; increase. Therefore one number is fixed. "At least this much I shall do." That is sixteen rounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But you are recommending sixteen as a minimum, and some devotees are choosing twenty as a minimum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who forbids? Who says that "Don't do it"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They can chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is wanted.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...are higher than any other activities or they are on the same platform? Any activities in Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Is chanting the most exalted or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is exalted. Therefore there are nine processes. <span class="Italic">śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> so many. They are all exalted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So why is it recommended, chanting in this age particularly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if you have no temple, so you cannot perform <span class="Italic">arcana.</span> So this is common, greatest common. It is not that because you have no temple, therefore your devotional service is stopped. There are other processes. You can do. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Prabhupāda? If we chant more than sixteen rounds, so how can we know whether we are imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura or following his footsteps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imitation is also good. If you imitate Haridāsa Ṭhākura, that is also your great fortune, even if you imitate. [break] imitating, it does not mean you are condemned. Even if you imitate, that is also good. [break] If you have some other business and if you say, "Now I am imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura, I cannot do it," that is very bad. "I am busy in imitating Haridāsa Ṭhākura." That is not good.
