<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 1, 1975, Atlanta</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of Europe and America, everywhere. You know who are <span class="Italic">mūḍhās?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Yes Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Fools and rascals who won't take your books. Sometimes we convince them that the philosophy is very nice, and they agree when we use Lord Kṛṣṇa's words, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> and they say "Yes, I can understand that, but I don't need your book," or "I would never read it." We say, "Well, no. Take it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) You ask them, "So you want to remain <span class="Italic">mūḍhā?"</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> We say, "No, take it home, and some day you will read it." They think they can find out on their own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. They cannot. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ya prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Sometimes they will agree to everything we say, but they will not give a donation. They trust more the man on the T.V.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is lake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> you say that the Rāhu planet is visible on the full moon night? The Rāhu planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when there is eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> Oh, eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eclipse means Rāhu planet comes in front. (Apparently reads sign:) "No smoking?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> "No swimming."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Who is going to swim now? (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Once Balavanta was very sick when he was dealing with the politicians, and I heard that you said it was because he..., by touching them and associating with them, he accepted some of their sinful reactions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) I did not say. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> So I was wondering. Sometimes our men on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> they are shaking hands...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> You cannot be infected. [break] ...party is infected, then preaching will stop. If doctor is infected, then treatment will stop. Doctor is never infected. They have good precautions. Similarly, when you are engaged in <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana, māyā</span> cannot touch. <span class="Italic">Māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> ...disciples and you accept our <span class="Italic">karma</span> also. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> That is manifest sometimes in disease on your body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> So our men also are going out and preaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The overloaded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra-kṛṣṇa:</span> When we take your books on the library party to the professors at the universities... (fades out)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> This way? Śrīla Prabhupāda, Śrīla Prabhupāda... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am surprised how I have written so many, what to speak of them? (laughter) It is all Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra-Kṛṣṇa:</span> One professor the other day was trying to convince one of our boys that you were coming in the disciplic succession and were authorized to translate all these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra-Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because he was dressed and he didn't know that he was your disciple, so he was saying, "Bhaktivedanta Swami, he is coming in a disciplic line straight from Kṛṣṇa. That's why he can speak on all these books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact. That authority I have got. That's a fact. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau, tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ prakaśānte</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> They become manifest, all the meanings of the Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktiḥ.</span> (aside:) Don't come very near. [break] ...explaining last evening. Don't speculate, hear. That is the qualification. All others, they are simply speculating. How long their energy will go on, limited energy? How speculating will help them? It is not possible. It is condemned. <span class="Italic">Athāpi te deva,</span></div>
<div class="Verse"><span class="Italic">(athāpi)</span> <span class="Italic">te deva padāmbuja-<br class="calibre2"/>dvaya-prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi<br class="calibre2"/>jānāti tattvaṁ na cānya<br class="calibre2"/>eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan<br class="calibre2"/></span> [SB 10.14.29]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Ciraṁ vicinvan,</span> speculating for millions of years, one cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Verse">athāpi te deva padāmbuja-<br class="calibre2"/>dvaya-prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"One who has received a little mercy of the lotus feet of the Lord, he can understand the truth. Others, even speculating for millions of years, they cannot understand anything." The speculation business is useless in spiritual advance. It may help Darwin to come to the conclusion that man is born from monkey. Because he is from monkey, he thinks others also from monkey. He has admitted that whatever he has given, it is simply a speculation. He has admitted. And all others also speculating. They are trying to manufacture life from chemicals, but they do not know that life is never manufactured. It is already there. Just like this grass is coming. The life is already there. In favorable circumstances it comes out. <span class="Italic">Udbhija.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">udbhija.</span> Similarly fermentation. Just like the cockroaches come out...
