<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is that Yogi Bhajan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What does it say? <span class="Italic">"Kundalini-yoga</span> as taught by Yogi Bhajan is a highly developed science of awareness. Join with us early in the morning to revitalize the body, mind and spirit. Daily practice of <span class="Italic">kundalini-yoga</span> under the guidance of a teacher helps you release the highest potential within the individual."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> One of his devotees has recently said that if he really wanted spiritual knowledge that they should come to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> One of Yogi Bhajan's devotees has said that Yogi Bhajan recently said if you really want spiritual knowledge to come to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Mahesh Yogi also says like that. (chuckles) And that, what is called, Satchitananda? He also says that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're wise men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We have a display over here in the window of your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Would you like to see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Very good. So they are selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is just a display for the students to see, like advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yesterday many people bought your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And it says here, "Birth, old age, disease and death." What is this? "The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we find information that besides earth, water, fire, air, space as well as the mind, intelligence and false ego, there exists a superior energy form. That superior energy is called <span class="Italic">ātmā, </span>the self. There is an obvious difference between you and the ground. That factor that distinguishes the animate from the inanimate is consciousness. That consciousness or awareness of being is proof of the existence of the self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. This is the library? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No, just student union. Around three thousand dollars of books were sold yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And sweets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Oh, around five thousand. (laughter) The tongue is most voracious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> I talked to one boy yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he was there at the festival because he had found your books in the school library. And he said now he was saved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] Kṛṣṇa dāsa, some scientists say that there is no life in the other planets, and some scientists said there may be. So who is correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, didn't the Yamadūtas... You stated in your lecture yesterday that the Yamadūtas said that what is truth is what is in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So I assume from the Vedic knowledge that there is life on other planets. Logically speaking also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How can you say there is no life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But the scientists are saying, though, that the nearest star to our... You know, they consider the sun a star. And that the nearest star to ours is four light years away. Which means that it's... They do not believe that there's life in this entire solar system, in the planets nearest us, the moon, Venus, Mercury, Mars, Neptune, Jupiter. They assume it's either too cold...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we say in the sun there is life. Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">. </span>"I spoke this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> science to the sun-god." So? Sun-god is dead stone, and Kṛṣṇa spoke to him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They're very convinced, though, that they went to the moon, the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I was going to ask you, Prabhupāda, is that the moon planet that we see, is that the same moon planet that's mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstras?</span> The same planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, same one. But the moon planet where they went, that is a dark planet. That is not moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Kṛṣṇa-dāsa<span class="Bold"></span></b>: My father is a graduate of Berkeley and he majored in astronomy and chemistry. And he's an atheist. And his logic is is that-it's very empirical-is that if there's other life, they have to have bodies similar to ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So it's impossible to have a life on the sun because we could not live there. That's the empirical way of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot live there; therefore there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's what they assume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot live in the water. Why there is life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, yes. That is fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nonsense, "empirical"? There are millions of living entities within the water, but you cannot live even for an half an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But to scientific knowledge there's no life in fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Fire is also one of the elements like water and earth. So if there is life in the water, life on the earth, why not in the fire? What is this logic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Actually, everything is burning. Even this body is also on fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the material ingredients, five elements... Out of the five elements, fire is one of them. So if in the four elements there are life, why not in the fifth? How do you say? That is their ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> You say even in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> Prabhupāda, that there's so many living entities in this body. It's evident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact. As soon as the body is dead, so many living entities will come out. Why? How it is possible? How these living entities are coming? What is the reason? You say the body is dead, so why from the dead body other living entities coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It becomes food for other living... It becomes food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Food or whatever it may be, but the body, the ingredients of the body are complete to get life. You cannot say some chemical is missing. If it is missing, then how so many living entities are coming? There is nothing missing; everything is there. You cannot say, "missing." What is that "missing"? You do not know. That is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> When I first joined the movement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I used to listen to your lectures and then go talk with my father. And he would argue with me, and I would find a question and come back and ask you and find the answer and go back and argue with him. But the thing I always came up against is that if he assumes that there's life on other planets or that there is a supreme source, a supreme energy or God, then it destroys his entire life's work, his study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are fools. They should stop all this education. This university should be broken. (laughter) Because they are producing only fools. That's all. They should stop this education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Donate all these buildings to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. The buildings will remain there, but they will be finished. What is this education? They do not know what is God, what is soul, and what is the meaning of education? Simply bodily concept of life like cats and dogs, so what is the use of education? They remain cats and dogs. That is no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They cannot live happily either or peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are, basically they are mistaken, how they can be happy? Basically they are mistaken. How you can be happy? They do not know what is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> As a matter of fact, that's the same thing my father said. He says that "Because you believe in God, he says you don't have to fear death." He says, "But I have nothing to look forward to."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is also the position of a stone. So you better remain a stone, but I am life. The stone does not believe in anything and still it is happy. So you remain a stone. I am not stone; I am life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> There's a verse in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> that without Lord Caitanya, there is no life. <span class="Italic">Acaitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes. <span class="Italic">Acaitanya,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So this dark planet, then, is closer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This dark Rahu planet, this is closer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rahu, yes. Rahu is between earth and sun. Moon is above sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So it is bigger than the sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. The size is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Stockholm, Prabhupāda, in the museum, they have a whole room, and in the room there is all these... There's American flag and Swedish flag, and there's a whole exhibit with one teeny little rock about as big as my finger nail that the Americans gave the Swedes. It's supposed to be a rock from the moon. And they said in it that it's exactly as any kind of rock that you'll find on earth. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say? It is simply cheating. They found this in Arizona, somebody... (laughter) And laboratory work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> I have been trying to arrange a meeting between Your Divine Grace and that astronaut. He was going to come to Rathayātrā, but he had to go to Florida for some space project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he say, astronaut?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He says that... His name is Edgar Mitchell, and he was one of the men who went to the moon. But we talked, and he said... He thinks he has gone to the moon. But he said that when he was there, he had a religious experience, and he felt that there was a God. When he went to the moon, he had this experience. So when he came back, he was telling all his scientist friends what his experience was. So they became very afraid, and they kicked him out of the space project. They thought he had become a fanatic, religious sentimentalist, so they kicked him out. So now he has opened up an institute for noetic sciences or... It is some Greek word. It means like spiritual sciences. He wants to prove to the scientific world that there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. He is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So we gave him a copy of <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and he's been reading that. He is friends with that other scientist, Wernher Von Braun, who gave that speech also saying that he feels that there is definitely God by his scientific studies. We also wrote him a letter, but we haven't gotten any response. Svarūpa Dāmodara prabhu wrote him also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He is a very big scientist for Fairchild. He started the space project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He invented those rockets in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, he was actually captured. He used to work for Hitler. He invented the V-2 rockets that bombed London, or was one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He gave a very nice talk in San Francisco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. About?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He said that from his scientific studies he is feeling frustrated. So he made a public statement that he is going to give them up for studying God. He says that he feels that everything indicates in the universe that there must be a supreme intelligence behind the workings of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very intelligent man. He is intelligent. As soon as one denies the existence of God, immediately he comes within the category of four classes of men: sinful, rascal, lowest of the mankind and knowledge taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The four classes that never surrender unto Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Or do not admit the existence of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> To assume that there is no God is basically nonscientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Because they're denying an entire field of study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadunandana:</span> The reason why the western world is so much involved in science is because the religions that have been presented here in the West have cheated the people economically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why cheated? The Christian religion says God created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> But the followers do not practice this idea. The original idea is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they became over-intelligent by so-called education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Over-intelligent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> How is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Over-intelligence means rascal. Intelligence is good, but over-intelligence means rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> How does that happen, when he becomes over-intelligent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Over-intelligent, it is sarcastically said. More than intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Oh. Speculative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> What I meant to say is that the directors of these religions like the Pope and so many things, they themselves have committed so many abominable activities that people have said, "Well, why should we stay with religion? These religious leaders themselves are eating meat, they have prostitution, they are cheating the people, taking their money, living very nicely..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not religion. Why you accept the Pope as religious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> No, we don't accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You reject. You reject. Come to us. Why do you accept these rascals as religious? That is your fault. Why should you stick to them? They cannot teach what is real religion, so let us give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Germany they say that's throwing the baby out with the dirty bath water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throwing? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They wash the baby, and the water's dirty. So they throw the water out with the baby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throwing out the baby?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> With the bath water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they're assuming because there's some irreligion amongst the so-called religious leaders, therefore they reject all religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Scientists, I mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? Because you have received some counterfeit coin, therefore you should reject all coins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's the logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not logic; that is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. You must be experienced, that "There are counterfeit coins. I shall be very clever, intelligent, to see before accepting any genuine coin." That should be your conclusion. Not that I have met one or two counterfeit coins, therefore I conclude there is no genuine coin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Just like in the old days when they would get a gold coin, they would bite it with their teeth to see if it was real gold, make a test. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> ...false, they must also conclude that there's something true. Because that is relative. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the basis for scientific rejection of religious dogma is that in the Medieval era in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious..., not dogma. Just like in Christian religion it is said that "God created this." So this is a fact, but it is not properly explained. And neither the followers understood how to explain, third-class men. So therefore they should accept, that's all. They should accept. Just like one thing, sweetmeat. A child is tasting. So if the child wants how it is made, so he has no power to understand. Therefore he should be simply ordered, "You simply eat. That's all." So in the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> it is like that. And therefore it is strictly ordered that "You should follow." The things are there but they are not explained because they were third-class men. Otherwise why the commandment was, "Thou shalt not kill," and they killed first of all Jesus Christ? So what class of men they were? All third-class, fourth-class men. How they will understand? Now people have become, by education, advanced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We should go this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because they have these sprinklers on here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they should come to big dictionary. This is Vedic. The Vedic truth is there, but it is not properly explained because the men were fourth-class. Now the people have become advanced. They should take to Vedic literature. Then they will understand how God created. But it was not explained because the people, they were living in the desert and shepherds and all fourth-class, fifth-class men. And now they, these first-class men, all advanced men, they are trying to adjust the tenth-class ideas, and therefore they are becoming rejecting, that "It is all useless." Now they should come to first-class understanding in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> As a matter of fact there's a very famous quote from Christ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think Christ said that there are many things to be spoken but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> "My father's house has many rooms, but I cannot tell you of it now."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they were fourth-class, fifth-class men. They will not understand. Therefore it is taken, "dogmas." The modern students, they are advanced in education, and these things are not explained. And besides that, their education is atheistic. Therefore they are trying to reject religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> They say you cannot study <span class="Italic">Veda</span> because Christ said that there is no other way than himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are fourth-class, unless he says like that, how they will stick? They were not intelligent men. Just like Lord Buddha also said, "There is no God." "There is no God," but he is God himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means the followers of Lord Buddha are less intelligent than the followers of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Less" not. They are atheist class. So they will not understand what is God. So he said, "There is no God. You just hear me and become nonviolent." So his idea was, "Let this rascal first of all become nonviolent. Then they will be pure, and then they will understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion</span> you explain that there are three classes of devotees. And you say that the third-class devotee, he has belief but he cannot explain or give any support.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is like Christian...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They believe that there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you believe there is God, that is sufficient. That is sufficient. But now they, being advanced in education, they want to know how God is there. There is no explanation. Therefore they reject it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They try to explain scientifically what's in the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That science is rascaldom. So how they will be able? Because the whole thing is rascaldom, how they will explain God? Those who are actually advanced scientists, they have accepted. "There must be God," they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadwaita:</span> But otherwise the rascals, they try and explain scientifically. They come to the conclusion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what is their science? Whole science is rascaldom. Just like they have never seen what is there in the planet, and they are concluding, "There is no life." You see? So they are all rascals. Maybe one or two like that gentleman who says that "No, there is God. There is grace."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So Prabhupāda, you said belief is enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for the noneducated rascal, belief is the... That is required, blind belief. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Blind faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> But to become an advanced devotee, do you have to have knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">catur-vidhā bhajante mām...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> <span class="Italic">Janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sukṛtinaḥ arjuna. Jñānī...</span> What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Ārto jijñāsur...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. No, this first word, distress, <span class="Italic">ārtaḥ, ārtaḥ. Artaḥ, arthārthī, jñānī</span> and <span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ.</span> So some innocent man, when he is distressed, he has belief in God. So he approaches God, "God, I am distressed. Kindly help me." He is simply on faith. That is good. And <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> means he wants to know actually what is God. Then his enquiry is advancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes philosophers make a distinction between knowledge and a belief. They say you can believe in something, but that doesn't mean that you necessarily know that thing which you believe in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's fact. Therefore for the neophytes, less intelligent, they should believe. That is the only way, <span class="Italic">viśvāsa.</span> So generally mass of people they are not so educated. They should believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> It says in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">viśvāsa śabde śudṛdha niścaya. Śudṛdha niścaya, kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya. Śraddhā, śraddhā. Śraddhā</span> means faith. So in Christian science also, there is state, faithful. So this faith may be blind, but that is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Like a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śraddha-śabde viśvāsa. Śraddhā,</span> faith, means believing firmly. That is <span class="Italic">śraddhā,</span> or faith. There is no question, "Yes." <span class="Italic">Śraddha-śabde viśvāsa.</span> Therefore we have to believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Vedas</span> also says like that. That example I give sometimes, that cow dung is stool. In one place it is said stool is impure; in another place it is said cow dung is pure. Now, one may argue, "What is this, contradiction?" But you have to believe it. That is <span class="Italic">Veda. </span>And that is actually being done. So without faith, you cannot make advance. The skeptics, they have no faith. Therefore they are lost. You must have faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? What is that ingredient or what is that thing which causes faith to develop in one? From someone becoming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purity. Purity. The more you become pure, the faith is firm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nārāyaṇa:</span> So faith comes from previous pious activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, may not be previous activity. You believe the authority, spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That comes from purity, faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As purity develops, one becomes more faithful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That purity is said, <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā:</span> "Beginning is faith." Now <span class="Italic">tato sādhu-saṅgaḥ:</span> "You mix with faithful men." Then it will develop. Otherwise, if you take simply initiation and then sleep, then faith will be lost. That is happening. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">adau śraddhā tato sādhu-saṅgaḥ.</span> You accept faith, maybe blindly. Now you make further progress by mixing with advanced devotees. Then it will remain fixed. Otherwise you will loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Faith is fixed by knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, faith may be blind, but it increases. If you stick to faith and follow the principles, then it will increase. <span class="Italic">Svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. </span>Just like... <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktiḥ yathā deve tathā gurau.</span> So if you have got faith in spiritual master then you will advance. If you have no faith, then it will be lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And unless one is pure, he will not have faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Isn't it is also like a child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Everyone is child. So the father says, "Do this. That's all." Like "Write 'A.' " He does not know what is A. But the father says, "You write like this." That will increase his education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But doesn't it come first because of trust?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, trust. Without trust, without faith, you cannot advance even an inch. So therefore it is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. Prabhupāda, what are the symptoms of purity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I do not know where this pathway goes. But you show me, "This way." So without faith, how can I go? If I have no faith, then I cannot move even an inch. I believe, "Yes, he is all right. Let me go." This is faith. I do not know whether it is going, which way it is going. So without faith, you cannot move an inch. So faith must be there, either it is true or blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So everyone has faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone has. Therefore the direction should be taken from the perfect, and with faith you will make progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nārāyaṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, but Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that wherever one puts their faith, He gives them the steadiness to worship in that way. So how come so many people, they put their faith in all these false gurus or people that impose themself as ones who are in knowledge and then they become fooled? Is this previous activities? Sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> You explained that in your lecture yesterday, that Kṛṣṇa is in the heart and He is giving direction to remember or to forget, that sometimes He is directing to remember Him, sometimes to forget Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because if you have no faith, then Kṛṣṇa will not give you instruction. When he is faithless, he will not make progress. Stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nārāyaṇa:</span> But people are putting their faith in so many different places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "So many" means he has no faith in anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say, "so many," that means he has no faith. He is faithless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda? If you say that purity is required for faith to develop, what are the symptoms by which one can be said to be pure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Just like "Don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this." So if you have faith, you will not do it. But because you have no faith, you will do it, and therefore you will go to ruin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> have faith that the sun will come up every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So that is actually faith in the workings of the Supreme, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your idea? I do not follow. Everyone knows the sun will appear, faithless or faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Is that faith?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not faith. It is fact. He is seeing every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the scientists will argue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is faith-means on knowledge. So faith with knowledge is very good. But beginning must be faith, with knowledge or without knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the scientists will argue that Kṛṣṇa consciousness won't be scientifically accepted if it's just based on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The scientists, how they can argue like that? Therefore they are rascals. First of all they explain something theoretically: "Hydrogen, oxygen-mix together it becomes water." It is faith. Then it is practically shown in the laboratory. So faith is the beginning. Theoretical knowledge means faith. Then experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> The Vedic knowledge is also that way, very scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So first we hear from the guru that Kṛṣṇa is God, and we have faith in that, we chant, and then we come to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you become purified, then your faith becomes fixed up with knowledge. Therefore that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam:</span> [Bg. 7.28] "One who has finished his sinful life, he can become a devotee." Otherwise one cannot. First of all, beginning in faith. Then, by following the process, he becomes completely sinless. Then he, full knowledge. And so long he will be sinful, the things will be not properly manifested. <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> So knowledge is not necessary for faith but faith is necessary for knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore devotee, without any knowledge he becomes devotee. That faith, only faith. The devotee advances. <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukī. </span>Later on, they become automatically full of knowledge because they have strong faith. That is also stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Teṣām evānukampārtham aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ nāśayāmy:</span> [Bg. 10.11]<span class="Italic"> </span>"Because he is faithful, therefore I help him how to get knowledge." Again you come to that. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Your lecture yesterday was so nice, Śrīla Prabhupāda, everything, so many ideas from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> all explained and put together so nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Blind faith is the belief that little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blind faith, without... That I have already explained. Immediately, why do you forget? He shows me, "Prabhupāda, come this way." So I have no faith. Why shall I go? Then I have stop here, finished, movement finished. So you have to keep faith blindly. And if the man who is giving direction, he is perfect, then your faith will make you advanced. But if you go to a rascal cheater and if you have faith, blind faith, then you are lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just like that little rock that I saw, that it's from the moon. Now that is blind faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, blind faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the wrong thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Socrates also, he was discussing epistemology, and he said that faith or belief is as good as knowledge for all practical purposes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same thing: the child has no knowledge, but he has faith in his parents, and he believes what his parents says. Then he is making progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have faith in you. [break] Now, I give sometimes this example. Just like you go to a barber shop, and you put your neck like this, and he is with the razor. So unless you have faith, "No, he is good man. He will not cut my throat," how can you do so? So faith is the beginning. If you have no... If you say, "No, I have no faith in you," then you cannot be cleansed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> That example became very clear when we went to India. (Prabhupāda &amp; devotees laugh) Because the barbers are so, they look like they could cut your throat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> You have to have a lot of faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can do that, but you must have faith. Otherwise no shaving. So many... Suppose you are going to some unknown place. Now we are purchasing, paying two thousand dollars, ticket. But where is the guarantee that you will go there? You are paying first money, but there is no guarantee that you will go there. Then how do you get the ticket? How do you get on the plane unless, without faith? So faith, without faith you cannot move an inch. It must be there. [break] ...believe, "No, no, this ticket is issued by the Pan American. They are good company, and so many people are going. So I will go also." That's all. So faith. You never went there, neither you know whether it will be possible to go there. But still, you have to do. That is faith. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> The airplane may crash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are so many things. There is no guarantee that you will reach there. But still you have to purchase ticket. You have to get on the plane. That is faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And all the passengers have to have faith in the captain of the plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the faith must be there. Without faith, you cannot go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So actually that's what scientific knowledge, at least the atheistic science, is based upon, that on one hand the theists believe in faith, that there is a Supreme. But the atheist believes that "Undoubtedly there cannot be because we have not seen one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. The same example can be applied, that you have not gone there. How can I pay you? First of all let me go there. Then I shall pay," he may say. But he will, "Get out. First of all pay. Then you come on." (laughter) That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> When we were first coming to this movement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we opened <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Myself, I read. I said, "I don't understand this." So I began to clean the floor, wash the dishes, cut the vegetables...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> And then by your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> By service only. You can understand God simply by service. There is no other way. And the faith begins from the tongue. You see? Therefore it is advised that you chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Then faith will come. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span> It begins... The faith begins from the tongue. "Why?" People will be surprised. "Faith must begin from the mind, from the eyes, and why it is said tongue?" They do not know. That is also faith, that "Simply engaging tongue in the service of the Lord, I shall understand." So this is also blind faith. But actually it is happening. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take{īūl prasādam. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So most of these people, they are so ignorant that we should try to engage them in works of devotion rather than explain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is devotion: "Please come here, chant with me, and dance with me, and when you are tired, take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They had five thousand dollars worth of faith yesterday in the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Yes. So whatever is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra... </span>Now, they say, "Faith begins from the tongue." "No," it is surprising. How is that? But it is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> So to encourage their faith, therefore the <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> must set example of purity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sādhu śāstra guru vākya, tinete koriyā aikya. Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, ār nā koriho mane āśā</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> Don't go anywhere else. Take this faithfully, the orders of guru. You are singing daily. <span class="Italic">Ār nā koriho mane āśā.</span> This is faith, strong faith. And that is described in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, śraddhā-śabde-viśvāsa śudṛdha niścaya. Viśvāsa,</span> firm faith. That is <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> Faith means to believe strongly. That is faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So actually, in regards to my father or atheists or scientists in general...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are faithless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They will never believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are faithless; therefore they will never make any progress. Their first principle is sacrifice. And in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it, <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā:</span> "First of all faith." And these rascals, they have no faith. Therefore they do not make any progress. And Rūpa Gosvāmī says, <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā: </span>"Begin with faith." So they cannot realize, condemned, because Kṛṣṇa will withdraw the knowledge. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir apohanaṁ ca.</span> So Kṛṣṇa will say, "Oh, this rascal is faithless. All right, make him more faithless. He will never understand." That is atheist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> What is hope for them then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To become faithful, surrender. That is. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "You rascal, surrender. You are not faithful; therefore you are condemned. You surrender first. Then next thing." So unless he becomes a surrendered soul, there is no hope. There is no hope. He will never understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> What is the best way, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to instill a little faith? How do we instill some faith in these people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Little faith... Therefore you associate. Just like we are inviting this morning lecture. Coming, coming, coming, coming-faith will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They will not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will not come. Then he is condemned. Let them remain animals. If you don't go to school, there is no question of education. Where is the question of education? One must go to the school with faith that "I will be educated." That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> But if they take some <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> that will help them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is your mercy, that you are... He is faithless rascal. "All right, you take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That will help you." Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> You may be pleased to know that Karttikeya... He said he's looking forward to going to Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise why he is coming again? (chuckles) There must be some faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I spoke with him the other day, and he said now he's getting a degree, but now he does not know what to do with it. So he sees that all of his activity of going to school and getting degrees is useless waste of time if there's no connection with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citsukhānanda:</span> Actually, nobody could leave your lotus feet, Prabhupāda. Once they've come and tasted this bliss of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, nobody could leave. Everyone comes back. Sometimes we become confused a little, but nobody can leave you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. [break] ...Mukunda, Mukunda, or Murāri? Mukunda. He was going everywhere. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected him. "Don't let this rascal to come here." You know that? Mukunda. (indistinct) [break] <span class="Italic">...api sarveṣāṁ mad-gata āntarātmanā,</span> then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhāvān bhajate yo mām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Śraddhāvān,</span> That is required. If he has no faith, then he remains in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> If we save the common people by giving them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> how can we save the impersonalists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will come later on. [break] ...ists will not come. They will never come because they do not believe in the personal feature of God. Unless very hungry, he will not come because he does not believe in <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> does not believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Just like yesterday those impersonalists wouldn't come on the stage. When they saw your opulent <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana</span> and so many devotees offering your <span class="Italic">āratik,</span> they realized if they came to the stage, they would have to sit at your feet. Therefore they wouldn't come. This one Swami Satchitananda... I have a friend who's a member of his movement. So this yogi told him that if you want to know how to receive the spiritual master you should go watch the Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees when they greet their guru at the airport... Then you will learn what is the proper way to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Swami Satchitananda told him that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> He cannot give instruction, so he has to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was rejected. But then appealing, then he was reinstated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They want the respect, but they cannot command the respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they... He was found implicated with some woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> You explain, Prabhupāda, that the impersonalists have to again fall down to material activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So this Satchitananda, before he became yogi, he was an engineer. So in his spare time-I was asking this boy, "What does he do? What is his life like?" I was wondering what he lived like. So he goes to bed at 8:00 at night, and no one sees him until 8:00 in the morning. So I asked, "Was he asleep?" So he said no, that he's in some trance. And then during the day he works on cars. He collects old automobiles, old classical cars, and he takes them apart and puts them together for a hobby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot give up his old habit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No. He cannot give up the engineering habit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> About this Yogi Bhajan also, when I was in Delhi ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Baradrāj:</span> Yes, in Delhi, there was one cloth merchant there. And he asked me, he said, "Do you know this Yogi Bhajan?" I said, "Yes, he is very famous." He said, "Oh, he is my cousin. We used to be in the cloth business together. And he could not make enough money, so he decided to go to America."
