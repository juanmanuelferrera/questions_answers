<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the material world, whatever you do, the central point is sex. That's all. This is the verdict of the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> Whatever big, big things you do, the central point is sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that's a point which I've noticed. Sometimes when I'm talking to someone, I tell them that "Practically speaking, all that you're doing is eating, sleeping, mating and defending." But they say, "I don't agree with you because," they say, "we're doing so many things. Just like our school work; it is not eating, sleeping, mating and defending. It is philosophy, appreciation of literature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the end? The end is sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The end is sex. Just like they have these big, big skyscrapers for so many businesses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This big, big philosopher Freud, and they're only sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but they're.... Suppose Sartre, just like you were speaking of Sartre the other day. His end is not apparently sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">śāstra</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Sartre, Sartre. You were speaking on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not that all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They just, I found that they don't agree when you say that. They say "I am doing so many things." Just like.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In your quarters, Śrīla Prabhupāda, or in the temple room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere is nice.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Are there any other Deities besides Kāliya-Kṛṣṇa you want us to make for Fiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and Guru-Gaurāṅga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī and yourself, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Life-size Deities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not seen Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Just the same size as Vṛndāvana's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> [break] That Deity, what size should that be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The height is ten feet, ceiling, ten or twelve feet. [break] Ten to twenty inches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Altogether, with Kāliya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kāliya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Just Kṛṣṇa. There should be four <span class="Italic">nāga-patnīs</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like mermaids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> What is the special significance of constructing Kāliya-Kṛṣṇa temple in Fiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that "Kāliya lived here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, might.... [break] But it is Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Kāliya then became a devotee after Kṛṣṇa subdued him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> They are both worshipable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] (continues in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was once told that these irregularities in the climate are due to sinful activities. Los Angeles has a very nice climate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> People I speak to, they say, "Yes, even in the last twenty years we can notice a great change in the weather patterns." People say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Disturbance means sinful atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> you wrote that when there is a great storm or hurricane, some demon has taken birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also that it is the king's responsibility to see that there is good weather. If there's good government then automatically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These buildings are churches, but they're all closed. But our churches are lively, even at four in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From four o'clock up to ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Now there's twenty-four-hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> So all day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break].... on the decline of the churches in America, and they say that the biggest reason in the last few years is that Pope, he issued one big statement against birth control and abortion. He said, "Catholics cannot practice birth control and should never have abortion." So they did not like this. So that is the biggest reason for the decrease in attending the church. They broke away from the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means if the church allows sense gratification without restriction, then they'll attend church. That is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're dictating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The mass is dictating. Same thing as in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means, conclusion is, on account of sinful life churches being closed. Not the Pope, but the sinful. Pope said, "You cannot do this sinful," and they are sinful. Therefore they desert their church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even the priests, they said that when the Pope issued that document, they lost faith in him as the representative of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Rascal priests also so sinful. Yes, they're supporting homosex. So when the priests are sinful, the public is sinful, how the church will go on? Churches, they are expecting church must support abortion and child killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, it is progressive. They feel that is the progressive way to think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And the church should not interfere with their.... That is their decision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is personal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] You say no meat, fish or eggs, no gambling, no intoxicants, no illicit sex, and we are all coming gladly. That means you're offering something alternative. They're not offering any alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have nothing to give. Simply denial, how it will act?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes when I talk with Christians, I tell them that "The reason that you're not feeling any bliss is that you're not following the way Jesus lived. We are living like him. He was wearing robes, he was living simply. But you, you're living in big fancy buildings with so many washing machines and this machine, and that your whole life is complicated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grievous folly is that they are disobeying the Ten Commandments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Disobeying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the.... "Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not be an adulterer." Those are the big ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Covet thy neighbor's property, steal. Dishonor the mother and father, the cow, the earth, God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, there's one of the Ten Commandments is "Thou shalt honor thy mother and thy father." But the mother is one of the cows, the earth. I mean the earth is the mother, the cow is the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they dishonor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have no eyes to see that actually we are following strictly the teachings of Jesus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they always say that Jesus ate fish. They always use that as an argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus ate fish, therefore we shall eat our sons? Is that any reason? Jesus ate fish, therefore I shall eat my son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And where does it say he ate any meat? Never. Simply fish. So we should tell them, "Then you eat fish, but don't eat meat. Stop meat-eating."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the great things is that they like to drink wine as well, because Jesus drank wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, he drank wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he didn't go to the bar. The way he drank wine was in a sacrifice. You're drinking in a bar. So anyway, we should tell them, if you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus drank wine, but nobody said Jesus is a drunkard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Drunkard, exactly. And you can also, when you can do all the things that he did, then you can also drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Jesus was crucified, I shall crucify you. Come on. You're so pious that now you prepare to be crucified. Come on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And you forgive me for doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. You take my sins and be crucified. Then I shall know that you are real (unclear). Take all my sins and I crucify you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> you wrote that Vaiṣṇavas like Vāsudeva Datta, they're even greater than Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did I say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. You said that Jesus only gave shelter to his few followers, but Vāsudeva Datta prayed that the whole sinful activities of the whole universe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Be on me, I'll take them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said, I think it said, he was a thousand times greater. You wrote that in the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature's law is not like that, that you suffer for me. No. I suffer for my. It is magnanimity that I'll suffer. Sometimes they do so, but actually nature's law is different. If you have committed theft, you will suffer; why I shall suffer? Even if I say in the court that "I'll go to jail," he'll not go. [break] ...city in the world except in America, such nice roads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The Americans are expert at building highways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got money and all these.... They want to do it (laughs) (unclear) money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They use these arguments that they are civilized, that they are making progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I say also. That you are fortunate. Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness and be the best nation in the world. Simply you take Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Indians would argue that "Just see. The Americans are not so religious, but they have good material wealth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In America, Kṛṣṇa consciousness has developed. What you have done? Why don't you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But our forefathers have done, and just see the mess we are in because of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forefathers ate <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> so lick up your hand. My forefathers ate <span class="Italic">ghee.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All you have is <span class="Italic">dalda</span> now,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Why <span class="Italic">dalda</span>? Your forefathers had <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> You enjoy it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually, if we introduce <span class="Italic">ghee</span> in America, we'll be very famous. That will make us very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do it. You have got enough milk, you can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was thinking yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that as our movement becomes greater and greater, then taking Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at a restaurant or at our Sunday feast will be like a national pastime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Everyone in the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the Rathayātrā also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it will be like going to the ball game.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rathayātrā, introduce in every city. You have already got some national holiday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll get everywhere. In this way, one day we'll capture the whole government, and you'll become the president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You said Balavanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balavanta may be his secretary. He can.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was told you once said that he would be in the White House before he's forty years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, I did not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was only to encourage him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, to encourage him. Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you bring public in your favor, it is not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a fact. You have to bring them in your favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "A Kṛṣṇa conscious man. He's a Kṛṣṇa conscious man. Give him vote." This opinion. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It will happen gradually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One day our men will be leaders of government?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Leaders means as soon as you make the public in your favor, you are leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they'll actually manage the government?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? That is Kṛṣṇa's desire. The Kurukṣetra battle was for this purpose. The Pāṇḍavas should be on the throne, not the Duryodhana. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. All round, not that we're simply chanting. We're fighting also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Arjuna monks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We had a nice experience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All-round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...in Berkeley, when we started to fight...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may not misunderstand us that we are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pacifists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pacifists, or a sect of religious faith. We want to remold, remodel everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's something we have to get out of their heads, that we're just some kind of select sect or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they'll understand as they read our books. That we are all-round reformer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have created so many problems, that to manage their government is the biggest headache.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They've created so many problems to solve. (apparently reading sign) (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> South Pacific Railway? ISKCON government means this, stop all these four things. No slaughterhouse, close. The meat-eaters may become agitated, they may complain, "No, you are not forbidden to eat, you can eat, but slaughter in your house."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Natural death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government is not going to maintain slaughterhouse, that's all. We don't forbid you; you can do at your home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The cows will die one day from old age, then they can eat.</div>
