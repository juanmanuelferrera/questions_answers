<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...five items. No illicit sex, no gambling, no intoxication, no meat-eating and chant sixteen rounds. Is it very difficult task?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why people do not take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They are just foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If by following these five principles one can be saved from all problems of life... Still, people will not take it. Just see, strong <span class="Italic">māyā. Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] What was the later on talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> With her? She just left. But the other old lady, who was appreciating your movement, she was singing and dancing all night. She was incredible. Singing and dancing and playing <span class="Italic">karatālas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At present Christian religion is made easy. Christian religion made easy. What is that? Now, first of all Christ has taken out contract that "You go on committing all sinful life. I am guaranteeing you will be saved." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or...? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So poor Christ has taken all concern. He will be crucified, and they will enjoy life. This is very easy religion. "I have nothing to do, and besides that, if Christ says something to do, that also we can neglect because he has taken guarantee. So although Christ says, 'Thou shalt not kill,' I can neglect that." And then, if still he is captured, he will say, "Bible is very old."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> How can we accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) How they have made easy life, that see. They are... There is a story that a boy went for examination. So when he came back, his father asked, "My dear boy, how you have written your question paper?" "Yes, very nice." "How?" "No, those questions which were very difficult, I could not answer. And the easier questions, what is to write? I know everything. (laughter) Easier questions, there is no need of writing. I know everything." Both ways he has not written anything. So these rascals, both ways they will not follow anything. And still, they will credit... Not only Christians, everywhere these people want to banish God. Simply we are canvassing "God, God, God." Otherwise nobody cares. Say about 1945, so in front of my house there was an old man. So as neighbor, we had very good talks always. So as soon as I say, "Bhagavān," he will be angry. "God." So one day he said, "Why you always say Bhagavān, God?" Just see, an old man and still he is such a rascal. He did not like. That is called demonism. Even the father of Prahlāda Mahārāja, that five years old boy, he was doing nothing harm, simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa-he became angry: "No, no." So big enemy that he wanted to kill him. This is demoniac. Some bad smell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a movement, Moral Rearmament Movement, started from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What was the name of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> MRA, MRA, Moral Rearmament Movement. Do you know, anyone of you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. Do you, Satsvarūpa? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it was going on for some years, then collapsed. The movement was started by some priest or gentleman, and it was supported by President Eisenhower. It was patronized by him. So their principle was that, Christian principle, that "You do whatever you... Simply confess. Simply confess." So that man came to India also with his party, just like I travel. [break] ...substance, no movement will stay. It may go on for some time, <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, what about our movement? It will stay or it will also go like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It will stay. We already have another generation coming up in Gurukula. The big danger, you say, is faction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go straight or right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Right. [break] He has taken safety place, and from safety place he is killing other poor animals. That is not shooting. The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they will shoot tiger face to face. Previously Jaipur Mahārāja, he used to go to the forest, and so he would simply fight with the tiger with a sword.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That doesn't happen anymore today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See the tiger has got its nails and teeth and jaw. So there was no firearm. He will challenge the tiger with a..., and he will take a sword and kill him. And then the tiger would be brought in procession, giving all honor, military honor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> To the tiger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> practice, how to combat his enemies. Fighting should be on the equal level, not that "I take all shelter, and you are open to be killed by enemy." [break] ...understood the process of transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Could it be said, then, that we are transmigrating even while in this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> From boyhood to youth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is transmigration? Transmigration means the first body you lose; you enter a second body, a third body, fourth. So your childhood body is not existing. Therefore you are in different body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> So that way anyone can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the way of understanding. And Kṛṣṇa says, the authority, that "This is the way." It is not that I have manufactured some philosophy. No. The most powerful authority, He says. So where is the position to deny it? Who can deny it, Kṛṣṇa's statement? If somebody denies, then he is a rascal. That's all. Therefore we say that we have no difficulty to find out a rascal. As soon as one denies this, Kṛṣṇa's statement, he is a rascal. That's it. Anyone who does not accept the transmigration of the soul, he is a rascal, that's all, immediately. So easily understood, and still they will not understand. What is the possible objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, that example can be understood, but for the materialist, he doesn't see how it applies to afterlife, one takes another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why, why he does not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Because he can't perceive. He can perceive that he has changed from child to old man, but he can't perceive what is going to happen after death. So who knows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he cannot perceive that we, at night we change this body and go to another body when we dream? He cannot perceive? Your body, this body, is laid down on the bed, and you go away, and you are thinking that you are in Europe and America or in the sky or so many things. So what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, while its happening he can't perceive it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is happening. He is seeing. He is a man. He is seeing. Why he cannot perceive? What is the difficulty? What is the answer, anyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> He is in illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illusion. You are seeing an illusion? Some tiger is coming. You are crying, "Save me, save me." It is illusion. This body is also illusion. But you are affected. That means you are experiencing. How you can say that you are not perceiving? And when in dream you see your beloved or woman and man, there is no, nothing such thing, but still, there is discharge. Why? Why you are not perceiving? How you can say that you are not perceiving. It is perceiving. What is the answer? You are perceiving every night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, in dreams.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that you leave this body, you accept another body and do something else which you see. If that is illusion, then this is also illusion. Because in daytime you forget that night activities, and at night you forget the day activities. So this is also illusion. So therefore you are in illusion. That's a fact, day and night, day and night. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is also <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> But they have accepted this as fact. The gross illusion they have taken as fact. This is also illusion. You are thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "German." What is that? By one kick of nature you are out, the cat and dog. This is also illusion. What is not illusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So there are also living beings, they accept the subtle material as illusion just as we are accepting this gross.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is going on. Therefore the problem is where is my real life? That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one understands, the rascal, that "This is also illusion. This is also illusion. Then where is my actual life?" that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I was hearing some statement about, from mediumship, of people who had died and they are living on a subtle platform, and they don't actually know that they have died. They are so absorbed that they mentally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all... They may think like that, but this is practical thing. Try to understand that in daytime you are illusioned by this gross body, and at night you are illusioned by the subtle body. So both of them are illusion. Therefore if you are intelligent, your inquiry should be "What is my real life?" That is intelligence, "What I am?" That is... Sanātana Gosvāmī placed before... "What I am?" <span class="Italic">Ke āmi.</span> That "I am simply hovering in illusion, gross and subtle. Then what is my real position? What I am?" That is real philosophy. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is called Brahman. When I am Brahman", so that is the beginning: "What I am? What is my position?" That illusion is going on. So the material life means he is in illusion for millions and millions of years. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona bhāgya...</span> So out of many such millions and millions living entities, one becomes conscious, that "What is my real life?" That is awakening. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-prasāde pāya [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he begins his devotional life: "My real life is this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Then as soon as one begins to understand who he is, the transmigration stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is that understanding? His understanding is that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. So let me surrender to Kṛṣṇa as He wants and serve Him." This is life. As soon as he is on this platform, then he is out of illusion. And if he is perfect, then just after giving up this body he goes to Kṛṣṇa. This is the process. If he does not fall from this transcendental service of Kṛṣṇa, then immediately after death he is transferred. Just like we are transferred from this gross body to subtle body, similarly, after death a devotee is transferred immediately to the Kṛṣṇa, where Kṛṣṇa is there, either within this material world or... They are first of all given chance to go to Kṛṣṇa. In any <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍa</span> there is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Nitya-līlā</span> is going on. So he is born there. Then actually plays with Kṛṣṇa, dance with Kṛṣṇa, talks with Kṛṣṇa. Apprenticeship. This is also apprenticeship here. So is there any difficulty of perception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you said that "I have no perception?" There is perception, every day, every night. How you can say there is no perception? The perception is so strong, sometimes one dreaming some horrible position, he cannot more sleep. The sleep breaks. So why there is no perception? He is so much troubled that breaks. He immediately comes to the safe side of this gross body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, takes shelter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how do you say there is no perception? So this transmigration of soul takes place that... Just like in daytime we are in this body, nighttime we leave this body and work with the subtle body, so transmigration soul takes place-with that subtle body he enters the womb of suitable mother, and this body is left. And there he grows again this gross body and then comes out. Is it difficult to understand? That is not illusion. That's fact. And death means that you left this gross body and the period you do not come out in another gross body, that period is called death. That period is called death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So you are dead for about seven months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that may be, according to the body you are getting. There are 8,400,000 species of body. So according to your work you will be allowed to enter into the womb of mother. How can you check it? Where is your scientist? That is nature's law, automatically. Just like if you are infected, you get this disease. That's all. There is no need of mother nature will take personal... No, the rules are so fine that you will get automatically. <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> The Kṛṣṇa's energies are so powerful and subtle that it takes everything takes automatically. One set up, then after that, after that, after that, after that-everything is there. <span class="Italic">Parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate. Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You have no control. You are simply under the grip of material nature. Everything, whatever you are doing, immediately it is being recorded automatically. Just like automatic printing press. You simply push the paper, and magazine comes. If you can manufacture some machine, you rascal, then how subtle machine can work on under the supervision of the Supreme?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, once you said that if we could remember our past life, we would go crazy because it is so frustrating to continue transmigrating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in this life we experience so much frustration. Even if we remember now, we become horrible: "Oh, I was in this state of life, I was in this state of life." Immediately shudder. "Oh, Kṛṣṇa has saved me." You should be obliged that Kṛṣṇa has given you shelter. You should... "Do not go again to that other platform." That is intelligence. The other day who was telling me that in Northern Pole, because there is no day, so many people commit suicide. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Sweden has the highest suicide rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because that is horrible condition for any intelligent man. There is no day. Why they commit suicide in Sweden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Because it is horrible condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On account of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> So I hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So just see how Kṛṣṇa's management, nature's management, there is day and night, day and night, day and night. Otherwise it is horrible. If it is all simply day, it is horrible also. And if it is simply night, that is also horrible. So He is so kind He has given day and night, day and night. So do not be misled by this illusion as others are being. Stick to Kṛṣṇa to save. That is the only... Is Stockholm also like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Yes. Who is from Stockholm? This is what I heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stockholm also like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In the winter months there is only a few hours, a few hours' sunlight. Then it goes down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, in the winter, it is very, very, long winter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The same thing in the summer. Some days the sun is shining all day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Sweden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. Midsummer night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no night, only day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen in Moscow. Practically, the night begins at half past eleven, and again morning, half past three or four. That I have seen in the month of June. Night begins at half past eleven. I have seen when the night... That is also not full night. It is not full night. So in this way, after few hours... So half past eleven to half past three, how many hours? Three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Three hours, four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three hours, I think. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four hours. Again daytime. That I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And in the winter it is just the opposite, always dark and a few hours day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is winter, at the same time dark. How happy life, just see. Advanced civilization. No light and winter. And still, they are happy. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, once you said that to stop this transmigration, one has to become completely disgusted with this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, unless..., how he can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? If he takes as a fashion, that is another thing. Just like the man who cannot tolerate commits suicide. Therefore you told me. Yes. One who is completely disgusted with this material life, he becomes fixed up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> What about Lord Caitanya who prayed that "I don't mind coming back again and again"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is devotee's sincerity, that he does not go to Kṛṣṇa for some material profit. Any condition, he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is his humbleness. And a devotee, actual devotee, he doesn't want. But it happens. Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> It will take automatically. But he is not, I mean to say, very serious, that "I must go to Kṛṣṇa and be saved from these material miseries." A devotee never says like that. He wants that "Never mind miseries. Let me chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That is his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> For us, is the perfection to be absorbed in preaching to others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Rather than thinking "I want to go and play with Kṛṣṇa"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Your... <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Caitanya. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> To everyone, tell them about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Not thinking, "Oh, when will I go to Kṛṣṇaloka?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it doesn't matter. You give him good advice. Just like a canvasser. He canvasses for selling some books or some... If does not sell, he is not a culprit. He has done his job. That is recognized by Kṛṣṇa. Devotee does not make any bargain with Kṛṣṇa that "Kṛṣṇa will give me this benefit; therefore I have become pure devotee." That is not devotee. Prahlāda Mahā... He is a merchant, "You give me this price. I will deliver this clothing." That is not devotion. <span class="Italic">Āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu māṁ marma-hatāṁ karotu vā:</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.47] "Any condition, I am your slave. Whatever You like, you can do with me." That is the sign, not that "If it is favorable to my idea, then I accept You." That is not devotion. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> no desire. Only desire: "Please accept me as Your eternal servant again." Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura sings, <span class="Italic">mārobi rākhobi jo icchā tohārā:</span> "Now, if You like, You can kill me; if You like, You can keep me. Whatever You like, I am prepared." <span class="Italic">Mārobi rākhobi jo icchā tohārā.</span> That is surrender. [break] Similarly, if we live on the nature's way, there is no problem. The extra brain and intelligence which we have from the lower animals, we are utilizing for the same purpose, the animal life. That lady was saying, "Now we are advanced, so..." (car comes by) It is our car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a camp. [break] We can return now. (end)</div>
