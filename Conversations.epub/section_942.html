<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give little, a small pot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Prabhupāda, you have given such beautiful temples, so many devotees, now to have a point of jump so that all India and all the world and other people can join in this. Your answers today were very penetrating. That can help a lot, saying that people can work outside but still be devotees, and if they can chant, if they can devote work, and if they can submit all the fruits of their actions, if this can be somehow made available, this particular...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, but these few questions only, the answers, that these are from you and these are there, then it will be a point of jump in the movement. It will be a big jump in the movement. And what can we do...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So come and join us and help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I would be most honored to do it, and I am trying from the outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are in Washington?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, I am in Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So organize here. Talk with the scientists and everyone here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I come two or three times a week for the temple, and I will be coming more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Your idea of the Institute is possibly the most magnificent idea, because that will bring all the scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, actually it is. At least those who are Indians, let them join. It is Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, it is such a wonderful thing. I was a hard-core Vedāntist before I came, and I was not satisfied. I think that by chanting one really changes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I bring all the Indian people I can, because I know, I am a scientist, I still believe in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your subject matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I have four doctorates in four different areas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I have a Ph.D. in chemistry, a Ph.D. in biochemistry, a Doctor of Science in clinical endocrinology. I have a Fellow of the Royal Institute of Chemistry of London, which is a higher Ph.D. I am in computer information and control engineering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Royal College of... That... What is is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Royal Institute of Chemistry, London. And I have a law degree. And I am in computer information and control engineering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) You are such a big man. Kindly join us and help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I would be most honored, and I'm slowing trying to work it out in such a way that I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the formula is all given in this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I find your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> most illuminating as compared to other <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> I have read, the translations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> How can we best serve the movement? By joining it? I have joined it in a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācaiḥ:</span> "By life, by money, by intelligence, by words." Either four or three or two, at least one. Then it will be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I'll be writing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> ...about the movement in scientific journals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> That I'll be writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> And I'll be writing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">dhiyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> And I'll be writing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vācaiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I'll also be writing in scientific way, books about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You write in our... We are going to publish one magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> 'Cause I think the movement is very scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (aside) No, call Svarūpa Dāmodara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I shall write in books and give it to the editors here to use it the way they best can. I normally publish... I only last month got a medical prize, a large prize, for medicine. My name is known internationally, medical journals. So I'll submit it to the Book Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you are qualified medical man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> No, I am only in research. I am not qualified to practice medicine, but in clinical medical practice and clinical journals I am qualified. I used to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From chemical point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> No, from medicine point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> From medicine point. In physics and mathematics I'll write in those ways, and I'll submit it and let them use it the way they feel like it. Previously I was with the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which <span class="Italic">āśrama?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> <span class="Italic">Kohasat(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> And before that with the Swami Ram Tirtha Mission in New York. I was a follower of Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> And at the Belior Math in Belior Math Daksinesvara in Calcutta. But I find that by really chanting... I was crying to God, literally, at night, that "Find me the path again," and then I found your movement. And I find it, yes, it does make a difference. I was also amazed that evening when the first two days ago I was thinking I will ask you five <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to give me. Out of that, you discussed four. And I was meditating on Hardwar, where I was born. All the time your face was appearing behind Ganges, and it was very strange phenomena. I do not know when I will be fortunate enough to have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> again, but in the meantime, I'm slowly... I feel that this movement you have done supernatural thing. Now, somehow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a great certificate, because it is coming from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> It's a supernatural thing. I do not believe that it is natural. It is in the world and eternal. I have been here... To be able to convert these people, to be able to make devotees, is unnatural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That indemnity bond? I think I can pack it away until New York City.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I could take care of that, pack it away until we get to New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will pack it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think I put it on your desk in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Indemnity bond. But the letter has to be written also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Today's discussion was possibly the most magnificent, and very clearly given, about people can be in work as well as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> ...devotees. This, today's discussion, if that is available in some publication form, just that much, then I shall be most happy to distribute it among all the Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I will do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ...</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's recommendation. <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> You remain your place, but engage your body, <span class="Italic">tanu, vāk,</span> your words, and mind. <span class="Italic">Tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> Engage all these things for Kṛṣṇa. So <span class="Italic">tanu</span> means senses. You hear about Kṛṣṇa and act for Kṛṣṇa. Then <span class="Italic">vāk,</span> automatically, words, and mind also. If you hear of Kṛṣṇa, you'll think of Him. In this way there is no need of changing the place, <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ. Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ, prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi:</span> "My Lord, You are Ajita, nobody can conquer You. But this person who has engaged his body, mind and words for Your service, he can conquer You." <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> This was spoken by Lord Brahmā, that there is no question of changing position. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never says so, neither <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> But in a regulative way there are steps, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> But on the transcendental platform these things are useless. Simply engage in the service of the Lord. That is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I am thinking that when the Institute is formed, I shall perform all the services, whatever are needed to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kindly do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I'll be doing that. I'll be writing now, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your family is also here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, I will be married very soon, in about a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They said Svarūpa Dāmodara went down to the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> pavilion, so we sent someone down to find him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Good. Now here is... All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, we think that you have done supernatural things. We can do at least just a little bit, just a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Finishing touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Well, no, just a little bit. We will not be able finish it, but we will be able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the student does roughly, and the master gives the finishing touch, painting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> You are very kind. But we will try. It is supernatural. To me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now here is Dr. Sharma. He is Ph.D. in four subject matters, and he is a lawyer, so he's very highly qualified man, and he wants to give his all aid so that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So we need his help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And he is convinced about our bonafideness of this movement. So by his example many other qualified Indians... And it is the business of the Indian. It is Indian culture. They are accepting. Present them most scientifically, and it will be a glory of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> It is up to us to bring Kṛṣṇa's words now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> ...to the world. He wanted us to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, kindly do that. So you talk with him in detail how to, if you..., whether our, this branch will be situated... They say here it is good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> For Institute? Yes... I am also going to Boston to see the facility there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he can write. He give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, yes, he can furnish it in so many ways, and we are going to need Dr. Sharma's help, because he's in the government agency in the scientific field, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If he wants to help us, he can help us in so many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Yes, I'll be very much honored to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he's convinced. He's not an ordinary person. He's convinced. So let us take his help and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I'll see what the government and the foundations... I can go to the foundation to help it. Once the Institute is formed, I can go to the foundations to get the money from them both to support the movement or the Institute for education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Once we get started on that... You must be very tired now. You have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Today is <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I do not know when I will be fortunate to have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> again, but I certainly think God will again give me the blessing to have your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> India is fortunate to have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall see every moment, every day with our work. If the work is going on, then I see you, you see me. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> And I think that Vivekananda came here before. He brought some things. After that, nothing was brought out. The only thing which has been brought out which is genuine, which is really in the benefit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian culture, it is really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> These are the only two things which I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> I will remember you always out of seeing you in this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your full name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sharma:</span> Dinesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice name.</div>
