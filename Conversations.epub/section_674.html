<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Brahmānanda explain. Trying for sense gratification. They do not know it, that what is the purpose of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That is their ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our mission is to eradicate this ignorance, that they are living in a wrong conception of life. That is the point. The human society is making so-called progress under wrong conception of life. What is the answer? Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> because they are living in a wrong conception, animal life. Wherefrom you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Kathmandu. Tonight I will go to Hyderabad. I am collecting money. But one thing I find even when we explain to these people, you know... Just like smoking cigarettes. In Kathmandu I was explaining to people, "What kind of enjoyment is this from smoking cigarettes? You are coughing..." This is the way Acyutānanda Swami also describes, so I picked up from him. "You are coughing. You are killing yourself." He also described like this, "Intoxication means poison. Toxic means poison. So this is intoxication. You are actually administering poison. What kind of sanity is this?" So all those people, they told me, "Well, I'll give up cigarettes later."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least they admit the fault, hm? Do they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Yes, some people... One hippie I was talking to, he was saying, "I believe in technology and Darwin's theory of evolution." So I said, "The greatest technologists in America have said that cigarettes can kill you. Why are you smoking these cigarettes?" He said, "Yes, I want to give it up," but then he kept on smoking. And to Indian people I explained about <span class="Italic">karma,</span> you know, "according to your activity," and they all admit, "Yes, there is <span class="Italic">karma.</span>" So I said, "Why don't you serve Kṛṣṇa?" They said, "Later, later." They all say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> So, your instructions in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> can stop their lust? It can stop... By hearing from Vedic authorities, their lust can be dissolved? Or do they have to just simply be frustrated in their attempts to enjoy sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are being frustrated. Who is successful in the material world? Have you got any instance that he is successful? (pause) Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> In every field someone is miserable. Just in America there was one lady, very famous etiquette expert, Amy Vanderbilt. So she jumped out of her window. She was sixty-nine years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many. I saw in Detroit, I think. The bridge is covered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> San Francisco. The Golden Gate Bridge they have put...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Golden Gate. That San Diego, I think. We crossed one bridge to go to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes, San Diego also. They have these fences so when people jump off they are caught by the fences. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I think in Berkeley? The tower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes. In the college university they have a big clock tower...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are the signs how they are disappointed. They are always ready to commit suicide. So where is success?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> They are practically committing suicide by their activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also another side. But practically you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Hm. But by this smoking cigarettes, meat-eating... I mean, we explain to them that doctors have found that meat-eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen about some thirty years ago, one man was sitting... I was traveling in the railway apartment, and all of a sudden he jumped through the window.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Whew!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of a sudden. He was sitting nicely. What he was thinking I do not know. But he took the opportunity of open window and jumped. I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> A kind of insanity overpowered him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Insanity... everyone is overpowered by insanity, anyone in this material world and who is trying to be happy. Everyone is in insanity. They are trying to different way. They do not know the only solution is, as Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇa...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. That they do not, neither they'll accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Especially Indian people, you know, they say, "Well, if I surrender to Kṛṣṇa, who will feed me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Indian, American, everyone. Why you are, American, you are so proud of your...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> No. (laughter) No, but because in India people know that they should surrender to Kṛṣṇa, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you also know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> But the general mass, I mean, of Americans, they don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are faulty, fault-finding. It is no good. Everyone. Kṛṣṇa did not say for Indian or American. For everyone. But at the present moment Indians are misled that they have been, I mean to say, induced to think that if they become like American or Western people they will be happy. That is misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> I was telling them that in America the big thing is they want to raise the standard of living, but then those people who had raised the standard of living, they are also killing themselves. But they don't want to listen. Actually in Nepal I was reading every day in the paper the king was saying that "Our goal is economic development. That is the top priority. Number-one priority is economic development."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? Which king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> King of Nepal, King Birendra. He's the only Hindu king in the world. He has so many... He is embarking on so many programs of economic development in his country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> They have been described as "chewing the chewed." They have no eyes to see that Europe and America, they have developed so much economically, but what is the peace there? They're jumping quietly. You see? (laughter) They are going to chew the same thing, chewing the chewed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> Does a person have to experience enough frustration to give up this process of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Frustration, that already said, that everyone is frustrated. But because they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> they do not know that they are being frustrated. That is the point. Everyone is frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> That goes on perpetually until they receive the mercy of a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> That frustration or that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well... Kṛṣṇa failed to give mercy, and what devotee will do? They are stubborn to stick to their principle. Kṛṣṇa said personally, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">, </span> but who is going to do that? And what the devotees will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> If we just engage them in devotional service will they ultimately become purified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our mission. Somehow or other go on repeatedly saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Because even that atheist hippie, when he was... after he was talking to me about the cigarettes, then the next morning I sold him a book, so he gave twenty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the way. Some way or other, induce. [break] Obstinacy. What is that, "dog obstinacy"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> They say, "Stubborn as an ass."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. [break] ...selling different types of religious system so that one may not have to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Many people were... On the way to... Even on the way to here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And big, big swamis are saying, "Yes, whatever you manufacture, it is all right." <span class="Italic">Yathā mat tathā path:</span> "Whatever ways you manufacture by concoction, that is all right." So they are satisfied. If somebody says that "You surrender unto me," that is not very palatable. If somebody says, "No, you can surrender anywhere," that is very palatable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Because that means no surrender. To surrender anywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...means no surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Then they're satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Many people say, "We have to do our <span class="Italic">karma.</span>" They are telling me, "Do your duty."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the duty: you surrender to Kṛṣṇa. This is the only duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> They say their family, their wife, their job, their children, all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sometimes they say, "When He wills it, then I will do it." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is not willing, when He says that "You do this"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> They say, "When He makes my heart... When He puts it in my heart, and when He makes my heart open up to Him, then I will..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you have no heart. You have simply stone. (laughter) That is sung by some Vaiṣṇava, that "My heart is harder than the stone, because I know that even the stone melts by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, but my heart does not melt. Therefore I think it is harder than the stone."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Once somebody asked Prabhupāda Mahārāja in Calcutta that "When can you show me Kṛṣṇa?" Prabhupāda Mahārāja said that "Here is Kṛṣṇa. You cannot see because your eyes are stones. They are not the eyes. If you have got the eyes, you can see it here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> "And these people have not come to worship stone. They have come to see Kṛṣṇa, and they are decorating, and they know that Kṛṣṇa is here." That at Calcutta, you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So what did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda, he accepted immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we should return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Return? All right. [break] ...seen by <span class="Italic">premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless there is love for God, who can see God? <span class="Italic">Santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu.</span> One who is lover of God, such saintly person, twenty-four hours he sees simply God, nothing else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] ...last night, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he was saying that if everything is ultimately spiritual, if one is spiritually advanced, he sees everything as spiritual. Then if everything is spiritual, then we can carry on just doing the same things that we're doing now, because it's all for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Kṛṣṇa says that "Everything is My energy, but..." <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣu: [Bg. </span>9.4] "But I am not there." This is the answer. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's expansion, but not that everything is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> It is also not spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The energy is there, but it is not spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is spiritual, but because I do not know Kṛṣṇa, therefore I see material. Just like this microphone. It is being used for Kṛṣṇa; therefore it is spiritual. Actually, originally, it is from Kṛṣṇa. So we are not using these material things. Everything, whatever we using, that is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if this is spiritual, spiritual means eternal. But this microphone will fall to pieces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but scientifically it will keep the energy, conservation of energy. Even it is destroyed, it will remain. The material manifestation means <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is sometimes destroyed and sometimes manifest. But the energy is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> And also remain in different form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. Just like this is earth. Now you prepare hundreds or thousands of earthen pots and dolls. When it is destroyed, again it is earth. So when it is manifested, it is earth. When it is not manifested, it is earth. So from the spiritual energy of Kṛṣṇa everything becomes manifested, and therefore originally it is spiritual. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir..., bhinnā me prakṛtiḥ: [</span>Bg. 7.4] "It is My <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> energy." So how Kṛṣṇa's energy can be material? Because we forget Kṛṣṇa, therefore it appears material. (Aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) [break] ...Mahāprabhu, as soon as He entered the Jagannātha temple He immediately fainted. Did He see the wooden Jagannātha? It is a question of seeing and prepare the eyes to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Once I went to one Gauḍīya <span class="Italic">Matha</span> in South India, and I showed them a picture of our Deities in Hyderabad. They said, "This Kṛṣṇa is white." So later on I told that story to Acyutānanda Swami, and he said, "Do you know what I tell those people? I say, 'No, Kṛṣṇa is not white. You just can't see Kṛṣṇa.' " So like that, sometimes we are criticized by them for Kṛṣṇa in the Deity being white. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa's energy is all-spiritual, then why in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> does Kṛṣṇa make a distinction-"My separated material energy"? Why does He say, "separated"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Separated... Just like I am talking and this will be reproduced as it is, although it is separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So He's not personally present there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When you replay, the same voice will come, but I am not there. So if you want to utilize this separated energy for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it will help you. Just like the Deity. Everyone knows it is stone, but why we are worshiping stone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is as good as Kṛṣṇa. It is not worshiping the stone. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Worship, who are worshiping, it never comes to their mind that it is a stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore the... That is the qualification. [break] ...qualified, you will see it is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> There are some religions that... Especially the one I am born in, they were especially preaching, you know, that "You should never see a graven image of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> "You should never see a graven image of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is required, because you are not competent to see God everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> No, but they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They prohibit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> They prohibit the worship of this <span class="Italic">vigraha.</span> They say that "God cannot be made into a graven image."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say it is blasphemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes, we also say. Although everything is expansion of the energy of Kṛṣṇa, not that everything is Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference between Māyāvāda philosophy and Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Vaiṣṇava philosophy takes everything as expansion of Kṛṣṇa's energy. <span class="Italic">Parāsya brāhmaṇa śaktiḥ.</span> (Aside:) <span class="Italic">Jaya. Sarvedam akhilaṁ jagat.</span> Everything is expansion of the energy of the Supreme Brahman. Kṛṣṇa confirms it, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.</span> Without Kṛṣṇa, there is no existence. But that does not mean anything existentional is Kṛṣṇa. That is Māyāvāda philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> These religions even say that it is offensive to say the name of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what can I do? (laughter) If the rascal says something, so what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Even when they write the word "God," they don't say, "g, o, d." They say "g, dash," then "d," so that they've indicated God, but they haven't said "God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> "It's too holy to pronounce," that's what they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can say, "G, zero, and d." (laughter) Zero between g and d. That is a nice explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Zero signifies their love for Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Zero is controlling both sides, g and d. Just like if you multiply something by zero, what it becomes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> [break] ...people are following very strictly, how can we preach to them? Some of those people who are following these religions very strictly, how do we preach to them, those people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask them, "What do you mean by religion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Well, they will say what is in their <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> their Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them say what is there. Then you can talk with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say, "I love God. I go to church every... Once a week I go, Sunday morning. I make my prayer. So what more? I have my family. I have my job."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> But I was reading in this <span class="Italic">National Geographic Magazine,</span> there is one sect of people in New York City, very orthodox following. They don't even go to cinema. When they have free time they are studying the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> their <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> They are very strict. They don't even shave their faces because it says, "Do not round the corner of your face." So they have these big beards like this, and their whole life is dedicated like this to reading and... They also sing and dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is something good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> When I was a teacher in New York I taught in one of their schools. I taught the little children... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After that, he is fit down(?). Then, if life member comes, he can simply stay in the guest room without any charges for three days. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> ...that one is making progress by how he feels, or should he just simply execute the order of the spiritual master and not worry about how he feels? How should... In other words...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is making progress, he must feel. If he is not making progress, then he will not feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> And that feeling is a willingness to serve Kṛṣṇa or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is always. Whether he is actually serving Kṛṣṇa... That is devotion. So if he is actually serving Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt bhajana-kriyā. Bhajana-kriyā</span> means <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> This is the result. If his <span class="Italic">anartha</span> is not decreasing, or becoming zero, then he is not making <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span> He is doing something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> And if he's not feeling increased ecstasy, then he should try to change his position or try to perform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no change of position. Position is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> Because once this question was asked that... In class a devotee asked that "I'm losing my taste for serving the Deity, and I don't know what to do," and so they asked this question. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can chant. There is no question of "I am losing interest." If he is actually following the rules and regulations, there is no question of losing interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is never any decrease.</div>
