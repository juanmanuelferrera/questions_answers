<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they're reading now. Here, although we have got books, nobody reads. But there they are reading. But nobody is... (microphone moving) That means they are concentrating (indistinct) with so many books. There are other books also. Why they cannot sell so many books. Unless public is interested... If one has read one part of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> he has got some impression, and actually that is the... [break] One young gentleman came, I do not know where. He simply asked me, "Swamiji, can I talk with you?" "Yes, sit down." His first appreciation was, "Swamiji, where you have got so vast knowledge?" I have already told some of you. So these people, these Americans and Europeans, they are intelligent. They are seeing that here are some ideas which is not to be found throughout the whole world. Therefore they are purchasing. Actually, it is right here. Every verse, every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> is so sublime, and if it is properly explained people must appreciate. There is no doubt about it. And they are doing that. In our country, due to the loss of our own culture and poverty, we have now taken, "Money is everything." Wherefrom you are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in charge of <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> He's here for the last six months. Jagadīśa left him here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...he has got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What taste does he have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> He seems to have a taste more for studying, but not too much for teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Study is not to teach. What is that study?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> I mean to say he likes very much studying languages and writing. He's a good scholar. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Has he written anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> In the classroom with the children he is not so expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Has he written anything? You say that he likes to read and write. So has he written anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> Just as far as I know, some articles for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why does he not write? If he has got a taste for something particular he can do that but nobody knows where he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> What I came to ask was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not fixed up. He wanted to take charge of the Deity worship, then he went away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has got a visa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has left Bombay long ago. Fifteen days ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> With four thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Really? He's in Rādhā-kuṇḍa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One boy came from Bombay, he told me, "If I leave I have to go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he's Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Bombay you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has taken four thousand rupees and gone to Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yogānanda is in Govardhana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Yogānanda is in Delhi. He's going to come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is his taste. Sit idly, and become famous as very good scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa Vilāsa:</span> He did not come to class so often. He did not even come to teach so often. Śrīla Prabhupāda, when Dayānanda prabhu was teaching the children he was a very good teacher and he liked very much to teach. Now I know he is in Tehran upon your order, but still he was very effective as a teacher of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Restless, that's all. Mind not fixed up. Restless. Now what he'll do with that four thousand rupees? It is very good program. If I get some thousands of rupees and sit down in Rādhā-kuṇḍa and eat, that is very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we can find him. We know where he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can find him, that is not difficult, but what is his mentality. Why he has gone to Rādhā-kuṇḍa if he was teaching here? You cannot rely upon him. When he'll go (indistinct). Rādhā-kuṇḍa, Rādhārāṇī's place, if anyone thinks that it is very easy to remain in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, the topmost place. Rūpa Gosvāmī has spoken-he must speak about Rādhā-kuṇḍa. But what he has spoken about other things?</div>
<div class="Verse">atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca<br class="calibre2"/>prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca<br class="calibre2"/>ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [NoI 2]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So Rādhā-kuṇḍa, who will live Rādhā-kuṇḍa? One is topmost devotee, and if he mixes with third-class devotee, how he is fit for living in Rādhā-kuṇḍa? There is no difference between Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Rādhārāṇī. So how you can jump over Rādhārāṇī? Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Rādhārāṇī nondifferent. How you can enjoy Rādhā-kuṇḍa by swimming? You cannot touch with your feet even Rādhā-kuṇḍa. You can take little water and keep it on the head. That is respectful to Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Of course, things are going on like that, but strictly speaking, Rādhā-kuṇḍa should be respected as Rādhārāṇī herself. That is Rādhā-kuṇḍa consciousness. Highest Rādhā-kuṇḍa consciousness. And if you want to live in Rādhā-kuṇḍa, then why he has taken four thousand rupees from Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, Girirāja gave him that money to buy books for our library of our new temple, for the library...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why should he take, why should he take the responsibility for purchasing if he's interested in Rādhā-kuṇḍa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's not right. He had his own money also. He just got a lot of money from his wife. Three, four hundred dollars he told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Money is not the strength for understanding Rādhārāṇī. If you have got some money, by the strength of money you'll understand Rādhārāṇī. That is another bogus thing. Rādhārāṇī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi conversation for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Girirāja was asking me for the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. The man who paid him, he was inquiring where are the books? (Hindi) That Mukunda, his class friend, he was doing that. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu rejected him. (Hindi) "He goes everywhere." (Hindi) We have got index in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> You can find out what is the meaning of... (Hindi) ...one who is rejected. (Hindi) (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>September 5, 1976, Vṛndāvana</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...Sannyāsī</span> should go on preaching, preaching, preaching, preaching. Practically, I was sitting here in Vṛndāvana, in Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. So at the age of seventy years, nobody goes out. At least from Vṛndāvana nobody goes at the age of seventy years. But Kṛṣṇa asked me. I thought that I must go, Guru Mahārāja wanted it, Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Let me try. So if I had not gone then this institution would not have developed. So this is practical. <span class="Italic">Mahataḥ nirvicaraṇam.(?) Mahātmā,</span> they must move. So when there is absolute necessity they may stay. Otherwise, they must move. Move on, move on, move on, move on, move on. No staying. That is principle. No staying. I am this old age, I cannot move... My... I... So many... Still I am traveling all over the world. I am simply interested that whatever I have done, it may not be vanquished in my absence. Let me go and encourage them. Otherwise, I have no capacity to move now. But still I am moving. Only for this purpose. <span class="Italic">Girinaṁ grhna-cetasam.(?)</span> So a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> must move. A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> must not stay anywhere more than three days. That is the principle. So he was moving, but his moving is creating disturbances here. Therefore I have stopped. And besides that, a temple is <span class="Italic">nirguṇa.</span> A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is forbidden to stay anywhere else, but in a temple he can stay for more than three days provided there is business. Otherwise, there is no necessity. So this is the exclusion(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That solves all the problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, solves or not solves, we shall see later on. But this is the principle. This is the principle. Solution, if we do not become very simple servant of Kṛṣṇa, problems will increase. It will never be solved. If you have got any other desire than to serve Kṛṣṇa, then the problems will increase. It will never decrease. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> begins, <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> No other purpose than to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is only purpose. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> So our only business is how to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa in His original status as Kṛṣṇa, and in His other status as Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and in both ways, He's insisting to preach. That is a very important business. Neither Caitanya Mahāprabhu nor Kṛṣṇa has recommended that you become a great devotee and sit down in a place and talk big, big words and simply eat and sleep. Kṛṣṇa has never said. That is not Kṛṣṇa's neither Caitanya Mahāprabhu's business. That is not required. <span class="Italic">Boro boro bado bado phet lanka mata kore het.</span>(?) "Big, big monkey, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy." There are very many big, big bellies in Vṛndāvana, but if they're asked to preach Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission all over the world-melancholy. Melancholy. Big, big monkey, big, big belly. So you have taken a very great mission that world preaching, that is very, very nice decision. So you have got buses and you have got capacity. You do this. And one in Germany, one in India, come and go, come and go. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Then I want to do that, but there are some problems which I'm experiencing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, for instance, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa has the habit of deporting my men to different centers, even against their will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't have that habit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then the men... I explained the other night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him explain, don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When we come to a center, naturally there are certain men who want to go traveling. Not all men want to go traveling, but there are definitely some who want to go traveling. And if they come to me, what should I do? Tell them, "No, I'm sorry"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, traveling, if somebody wants to travel, what he is, first of all you must know. A <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> they are meant for preaching. Not <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, not <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> I'm not taking any <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha,</span> yes, if he wants to travel, so there is no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But what is happening is that for instance, someone will join me, then Gopāla will catch up with him and send the man to Delhi or to Hyderabad. The man will run away and come back again, and again he will be forced to go away. This is what I object to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, this is wrong. I'll tell you what the facts are. In every temple there are certain key positions for some devotee. In no temple we are trying to keep more than necessary. Sometimes they come and he preaches to them and he gives them money. If he is the temple president... Like in Bombay Haṁsadūta came, he had a fight with Girirāja. Girirāja was ready to write such a strong letter to you. He gave money to few devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The temple establishment, that has to be maintained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That I understand. Prabhupāda, I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why, why the...? Besides that, if you want to take someone or if anyone is willing to go with you, the president of the local temple, he should be requested. Or the man who wants to go, that "I want to go with him." So if the president thinks that he can be spared, then he can go. But if he thinks that his presence is necessary, why he should go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is one of the GBC resolutions. No devotee can go without the temple president's permission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot hear two. Let him... When I ask him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In this particular instance, and practically always, I do that. But Girirāja was so unreasonable about the matter that the boy actually ran away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that, that, there are so many people... If you do not satisfy his senses, everyone is free to run away. That you cannot check. You cannot say, accuse somebody or somebody. Because here everyone is giving voluntary service. Nobody is servant. So if he doesn't like something, at any moment he can go away. At any moment. Just like yesterday the Śāstrī came. So he went away. And somebody, they are coming, going. You cannot check them. Because they are not our paid servants. If they are very kind that they have come here, cooperating with us. But still there is some decency, if one is engaged in some work, all of a sudden he should go away, all of a sudden... That is not very good. That is not very good. Decently, that I used to go, and now in preaching work, so there will be no difficulty, this is the arrangement. Something must be done. All of a sudden, if somebody goes, that isn't very good. Tamāla also, if he did so, that is not good. Because I want some men, I cannot kidnap from any place. That is not good. We must see that the management is going on. The management may not suffer. But the president should allow to go if there is extra men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, another point in this connection, Prabhupāda, the men who come with me, they don't stay with me forever. They will stay a few months some of them, and then they go. In this way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is the habit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> For instance, in this temple, there are so many men which are on our party who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many men. We don't want so many men. Now we are going to minimize. We don't want so many men. That if, now we have to estimate how many men absolutely required. So many men we shall keep. Others, they must go for the preaching. They must go to the preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can all go on the buses, the extra men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they should be distributed. They may go to other centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hyderabad needs men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here, unnecessarily increasing men and increasing expenditure, twenty thousand, twenty-five thousand, thirty thousand. Why? Unnecessary. Only minimum men should be kept who are actually useful. There is no need of keeping extra men. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> When you originally were speaking about Vṛndāvana, you mentioned that Vṛndāvana would be a place for those people who have become a little disturbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or burned out, we call it, from so much activity, that he comes here and gets rejuvenated. Is that still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact, but provided he is devotee. If he's not a devotee then he will go away, here and there, here and there. That is the habit. And a devotee is satisfied anywhere. A devotee is not that "I'll go to Vṛndāvana, then I'll be satisfied." <span class="Italic">Nārāyaṇa-parāḥ sarve na kutaścana bibhyati [SB </span>6.17.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> I did not go to your country taking Vṛndāvana with me. I had to stay in places where in the refrigerator there is meat. And I was cooking. When opened it I saw, "Here is meat. All right, what can be done? Hare Kṛṣṇa." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But actually you did take Vṛndāvana with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if I would have stuck to Vṛndāvana, "No, no, I cannot go anywhere, leaving Vṛndāvana." No, we can go to hell if there is Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So is there some time that maybe somebody could stay here when he comes in that frame of consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is... Not that. It should be now restricted. Not that anyone comes and whimsically goes away. This should be restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These devotees just create a disturbance, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They don't want to be engaged and everybody copies them and the whole atmosphere gets...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> A lot of devotees think... They come here... Therefore work is not necessary. Simply chanting and being in Vṛndāvana is nice. That's wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Chanting, but there is expenditure. Who will collect this twenty-five thousand? It is increasing. I can maintain them provided they are actually serious about making progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Not that some lazy fellow will come, and because he has come to Vṛndāvana, Kṛṣṇa-candra has become very much obliged to him. Kṛṣṇa-candra had no other friend. He has come from somebody. That mentality should be curtailed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What if he comes with money to pay for himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there a guest house? Stay. There is no harm. There is guest house, he can pay and stay. But here we shall keep only minimum number of men without whom we cannot make, manage it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, how it is possible? Who will bring twenty-five thousand per month? I'm surprised. Twenty-five... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It's much more. Sometimes thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this must be stopped immediately. We cannot pay more than five thousand. You stop. We cannot pay. (Hindi) My Guru Mahārāja used to say, (Bengali) "Joint mess." This is not possible. That we have to maintain a big bundle of burden. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But still, we have to welcome anyone who comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-five thousand, thirty-thousand per month? What is this? Where is that temple in Vṛndāvana who is spending twenty-five thousand, thirty thousand? Can you say any temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Not more than five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So we cannot pay more than five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> For eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then clothing is more? Clothing is more? Maintenance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everything. Hundred rupees per head. You do not require to collect. I shall pay five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There should be a budget here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Budget is there. Hundred rupees per head. Fifty men if you keep, it is five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can keep less. We don't want fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. It will be less. But I'm prepared to pay you five thousand rupees for fifty men. Not more than that. That I can pay. You do not require to collect. You sit down. But work hard here. Not that eating, sleeping. No. That cannot be. That cannot be done. They must be engaged twenty-four hours. That is wanted. It is not a lazy free hotel. Anyone lives, he must be engaged twenty-four hours. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If he has no work, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa here. That should be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? We have this twenty-four <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> I've requested everyone who comes to do at least one hour per day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question. This is the condition. If you agree, then stay here. Otherwise, you go to Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Also visiting devotees should do that too. Anyone who comes here should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must make a rule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> At least one hour in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why one hour? Four hours. Four hours. Four times. Morning, evening, night, morning again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Already, the rule is made...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, already rules we are... Just like to continue <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> there must be four batches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, four men I have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four batches. That means six hours, four. Three hours. Three hours. Not four hours. So one batch four hours. From morning six to nine. Another batch from nine to twelve. Another batch twelve to three. Another batch three to six. Again the morning batch six to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Eight different batches, that makes a total of thirty-two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Not, why thirty-two? Twice one batch. One batch attending once in the morning, once in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Sixteen. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then if there is fifty men, we cannot spare sixteen men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is nice. Only to be managed. Only to be managed. So I am prepared, I'll pay you. Even if you have no money I'll pay you five thousand rupees. Keep fifty men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't think it's necessary for you to pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if necessary, I'm prepared. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, it's not necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then thank you. That is another thing. But fifty men you can keep. Fifty men you can keep. And there is collection in the box. There is collection by <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And the altars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be engaged fully in Deity worship. Not extravagant. That I shall see. I shall remain here. How things are going on. I shall manage myself. I shall see how things are going on. So anyway, fifty men, five thousand. No more twenty-five thousand. Forget. No more twenty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's three rupees a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If it's three rupees, thirty paisa a day for eating, soap, and toothpaste...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No soap. Take this Rādhā-kuṇḍa's... Why soap? You are so devotee of Rādhā-kuṇḍa, why you require soap? This is nonsense. You take earth from the Rādhā-kuṇḍa or Vṛndāvana. <span class="Italic">Vṛndāvana-dhūli.</span> Why you require soap? (Hindi conversation to the effect that if one has the dust of Vṛndāvana or Rādhā-kuṇḍa, there is no necessity for soap) <span class="Italic">Nim datun?</span> I was doing <span class="Italic">nim datun(?)</span> until the teeth fell down. You will know that I was collecting <span class="Italic">nim.</span> But now it is impossible. That also I have manufactured my own toothpaste. I purchase only the brush and I made my toothpaste at home. I never used any toothpaste. Even in my young days. I never used. You have seen it practically. Not only that now I have become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> When I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> I never used. When I was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> I was using that <span class="Italic">nim datun(?)</span> regularly. And I can give you the paste. So if you cannot use <span class="Italic">nim datun,</span> you can use this paste. Very simple. (Hindi conversation for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> One problem is that the devotees who are not serious, we say they cannot stay here. Yet, because they are still attracted to Vṛndāvana, many times they go and find a place outside the temple in Vṛndāvana and they make a bad example. This problem we cannot solve. Or they go to Rādhā-kuṇḍa and live. We say, "You cannot stay here because you won't help in some way." Therefore they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, cannot stay... You can allow three days free. You can receive guest for three days. Not permanently. And they can... That is very reasonable. If they have come, spending so much to Vṛndāvana, they cannot pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They usually have money. Everyone who comes from America, Europe, has some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is the difficulty? What is the difficulty if they have got money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> See the shop here. See all the shop whether they have got money or not. You have opened a canteen here and you can note from there who has got money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, money they have got. There is no doubt. They are not coming from poor country, either poor. No, we are welcoming provided he is reasonable. Simply to exploit, that is not good. That is not good. What do you think? In our Indian system, if somebody goes to a <span class="Italic">sādhu's āśrama,</span> especially <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> immediately he pays fifty rupees, hundred rupees. He'll not stay more than three days, four days. But he knows "The <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> wherefrom he'll bring money? Take." They are paying without staying. Just like yesterday this man came, and you have seen so many people come. In your country also it is done. That is up to the man's conscience. That I have come here, so I require to stay. Pay something. But not that... That should be properly expended. So anything can be done very nicely provided there is good management. I do not see any difficulty. I am present here. If there is any difficulty, ask me. I shall advise. (Hindi) Per head hundred rupees is sufficient. Not more than that. Even, how many devotees are here now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> We have sixty. About sixty. There are, many women are there. Normally there has been about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to fifty I take charge. I shall pay hundred rupees per head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't need more than fifty, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because Hyderabad needs devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there are more they can go to other centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now we have the farm in Hyderabad. Mahāṁsa's asking for men for the farm, for the temple. They can give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have got the biggest farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six hundred acre farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As we have organized New Vrindaban farm, and Philadelphia farm, so the farm was also to be organized by you. That was the contemplation. So six hundred acres of land. Very nice land. Very nice land. Six hundreds and it is not with (indistinct) like Vṛndāvana, but very fertile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It can produce enough food to feed the whole society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Irrigation system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Do you want me to take care of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would be best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The thing is, the money that I had put aside for that farm I gave to Mahāṁsa, so he should give it back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should be very much encouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, the money that I put aside to start that farm, to buy some irrigation equipment and so forth-initial investment-I gave it to Mahāṁsa on your order one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees. I gave him one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is for construction, and he's going to take it back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is for construction. That is not for the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no, that money, I intended to use for the farm. But it took so long to get that farm. So when we gave it to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that can be... That I guaranteed. That I guaranteed one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> that if he does not pay, I shall do it. That guarantee still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Should I develop that scheme then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let us have the farm first of all. I do not know what is the position now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's coming soon, Mahāṁsa said. So he can develop the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your main business should be <span class="Italic">mahad-vicalanam. Calanaṁ vicalanam.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's just that in this one particular problem it would be better, that's all. He has already sent them away. He has already sent a number of men away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who? And they are all the temple devotees. What I'm saying is don't rob men from these temples have to be supported. They're taking away men from the temples and the temples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't want to make a fuss, but right now there are six or seven first-class men who are working in your temple who are on this party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take them all, but still the temple will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can take them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take them out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's what I'm afraid, that he's going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Your men you take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I am only requesting you to return the temple devotees which you have stolen. That's all. I don't want one man from this party. We will manage it. Just return the temple devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (talking back and forth to Gopāla Kṛṣṇa-indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday I told him that temple painting is going on... Who is painting? I never saw. (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So we should have one kitchen only. One kitchen? As we had discussed last night. Now we have a Deity kitchen and a devotee kitchen. We also have a guest house kitchen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why three?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So the devotee kitchen and Deity kitchen could be made into one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's decided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. So I'll give you a list of the preparations we'll offer for your approval. It means we'll be offering less to the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is difficulty? (Hindi conversation) How many Deities are there? Guru-Gaurāṅga four, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma two, six, and...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The CID is going to our life members and harassing them. They are scared of becoming our members now. Even in Chandigargh, Caitya-guru told me your books were on display in one life member's stores, he has two stores. And CID went to him and said, "Why are you displaying these books? What's your connection? Why're you helping Hare Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So selling books is illegal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but they are just suspecting, they're so suspicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that suspicious? We have got books. We are selling.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you did not know. Canada I had very little problem. U.S., it was always problem. Rather Canada helped me. Canada, I immediately got immigration in Canada. Then I got some standing. That never mind, I have got now immigration in Canada. It will be easier from Canada to go to U.S.A. Then again I tried for U.S.A. And [in Canada] it was obtained within three months and spending only within hundred dollars. And there, in America, they were spending each time $150. The lawyer was taking. He was phoning, "Will you please send $150 for this expense." And how many times he has taken I do not know. They were paying. Rāyarāma was at that time chief man. He immediately... This was going on. Then when I came to Canada... First of all, I made my position secure, that "Let me have Canadian immigration." So Canadian immigration I got very soon. I think within two months. Then I applied for U.S.A. immigration. So U.S. immigration I got within three months. And I paid I think within hundred dollars. So... You know. When I came to Montreal?</div>
