<div class="Heading">Conversation on Train to Allahabad<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 11, 1977, India</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are going out to sell our books, and even if the person does not want to buy, we are insisting that they buy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our duty. That is our duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He thinks it is too aggressive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, that is your temperament, because everything has got degree according to the man. So we should not worry. This is very nice, that we are imploring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So his conclusion was that all the people who we are selling books to, they do not like us. That was his conclusion. So I said that if they do not like us, then why is our book sales increasing? We started off selling two hundred thousand magazines a month. Now one million a month. So if you say that people do not like us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not two hundred thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Twenty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ten thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Began with five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And we said that people are writing us so many letters ordering our books by mail. So you say do not like us, but we say they love us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was his reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On every point he was defeated. Then this Reverend from the Lutheran Church, he said that we have invented this Kṛṣṇa religion. He said that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary man who is a sex symbol, having so many women, <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> wives, and that we are saying that He is God. And this is heresy, he told us, a concoction. So he was defeated in different ways also. And at the end he had to admit that "The only way to find out is if you buy their books, so everyone go buy their books and see for yourself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even taking it that Kṛṣṇa is after sex, then if sex is bad, then why <span class="Italic">you</span> are after sex? The whole world is going on after sex. How you can deny it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says that sex is not for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If sex if not there in God, then how it comes? If God created everything, so God did not create sex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They think it means we are saying God has a material body, because they associate sex with material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material body has no sex. A dead man does not enjoy sex. Do you think that a dead man enjoys sex? Suppose a beautiful girl-dead. Will you accept for sex? Then why do you take that sex is for the body? (train noises) "Sex if for the material body" is not the fact. When the soul is not there, where is sex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They consider sex to be his lower nature, animal nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Everything is..., becomes animal nature when it is perverted, when it is contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They do not have any conception of the positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have no conception of pure life. So they think that it's just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they have no conception, we should give them conception that the body is dead, decomposed, then where is the sex? Where is the inclination? Similarly, the soul originally... As it is said in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> that "Everything is coming from Brahman." <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>:</span> "Now let us talk about Brahman." This is the meaning of <span class="Italic">athāto brahma-jijñāsāh.</span> Then next verse is..., <span class="Italic">sūtra,</span> code-<span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> And Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless sex comes from God... It may be perverted in the material world. That is another thing. But originally, pure sex must be there in God. Otherwise how it comes? Everything is emanating from the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So how you can say there is no sex? Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura explains that <span class="Italic">janmādy asya, ādi-rasa. Ādi. Ādi-rasa</span> means sex enjoyment. So he has explained that sex has come from... Because we have used perverted sex, we have got a very bad idea. But actually sex is there in the original. Otherwise there is no question of <span class="Italic">mādhurya-rasa. Hlādinī-śakti.</span> There is no question of sex. You do not understand Absolute. The opposition party will inquire you, but sex is originally from Brahman. That is why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His argument was that when Kṛṣṇa was here, He was having friendship with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> who were married to other men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is immoral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> God never acts in an immoral way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that you have made, immoral. Because if He is the proprietor, then He is the proprietor of everything. You have accepted one woman who belongs to Kṛṣṇa. You are immoral. He is the original proprietor of everything, and everything belongs to Him, but He has given you one woman. <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena.</span> But no woman belongs to you. So you should stop connection with women. It is immoral. Otherwise every woman belongs to Kṛṣṇa. How you can use Kṛṣṇa's property? That is the disease, that we are trying to enjoy Kṛṣṇa's property. Kṛṣṇa's the proprietor. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva... [Bg. </span>5.29]. He's the <span class="Italic">bhokta,</span> He's the enjoyer. How you can enjoy Kṛṣṇa's property? That is immoral. And therefore you shall be punished. You are being punished. Because we are encroaching upon Kṛṣṇa's property illegally, therefore we are suffering. Kṛṣṇa is moral, you are utilizing unauthorized, using this material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His argument was that if God comes to this world and displays activities with women, it is natural that the followers of that religion will also want to have affairs with women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because they have not studied Kṛṣṇa, they misunderstand in that way. You are fond of woman. Kṛṣṇa comes to show you that in the Vaikuṇṭha, Goloka Vṛndāvana, there is woman, but not in this way. Originally there is. That is pure. So it requires education. You are not educated; you cannot talk. Now sex..., even in our material experience we find that by sex many great men has been found. So how you can accuse sex? You are talking. We should say, "You are a product of sex. So how do you say that sex is bad?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that when one man has many different women, then that is immoral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all answer. Suppose you are a big man, but you are product of sex. Are you born differently or through sex? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sex is not bad. When it is misused, that is the defect. Otherwise, sex is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Western conception is that one man can only have one woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If he can produce many big men, he can have hundreds of women. But you cannot do that. Therefore you are restrained. You are bad. You better restrain. Don't have sex, because you'll produce cats and dogs. But one who is able to produce great brain, great philosophers, he should produce hundreds. You do not know how to produce good brain. Therefore you stop! Don't produce cats and dogs. For you it is "Stop." You do not know how to use sex. Therefore you should stop. [break] You should not any more use sex. But one who can produce better brains should have hundreds of times. You must know how to produce. That is Vedic civilization, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ saṁskāra idam...(?)</span> It is not a secrecy, how to produce brain. And because brain is not produced, therefore there is agitation, that they have no brain. They do not know the value of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. You have been produced like cats and dogs; therefore you cannot appreciate. Therefore you should stop. But one who has power to produce brain, to produce Kṛṣṇa conscious children, they should be use. Foodstuff is forbidden for a person who cannot digest. One who can digest food, he must eat sumptuously. There is no restriction for him. Food is not bad. One who cannot digest, it is bad for him. This is the conclusion. What is food for one is poison for another. If you cannot use sex power how to use it for better purposes, you should not use sex. What is that verse that Kṛṣṇa says? <span class="Italic">Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya...</span> [Bg. 14.4].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā. Tasmin garbhaṁ vadāmy aham. Garbhaṁ vadāmy aham.</span> [break] ...further condition, one who thinks there is no good or bad. Everything is bad. He is thinking, "I am your friend..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good explanation-stool. Stool, this side or that side... [break] More opposition there will be, more we have to defend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's forcing us to become expert in different fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You said, "Take the opportunity to be well advertised."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So we have to scheme in so many different ways to take advantage of this. (train stops) [break] ...friends with all the newspaper, television and radio people. Already in Los Angeles they know us by our first names, and we know them by their first names. There is some familiarity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intimate with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And there's also a chance to meet government leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Someway or other, it is becoming popular. (chuckles) Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, should we be thinking in our minds that one day the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will have to manage the cities and the nations of the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So there are so many different departments in managing such a big thing. It requires a lot of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We shall... If people become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then the so many nonsense departments will be reduced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The department, the sinful departments, illicit sex, meat-eating, this will be closed, and that will make simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Completely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at least we shall try to make closed. And if people become localized, then this traffic will be little. Just like I am trying to organize the farm. If people do not come out of home, then this system will be obsolete. There will be no more department. They have created hundreds. They do not know how to manage it. For livelihood they have to go to Bombay, and therefore they require so many local trains. But if they localized, they can get their livelihood locally, there is no question of these all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America this is becoming the number-one problem-unemployment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They must be. Artificial employment. (train re-starts)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> People go to college in America; they can no longer get jobs. They spend so many years going to college getting their degree. So now they cannot find any jobs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the position in America. And what to speak of this country. Therefore, after being educated they go to foreign countries. You'll find so many Indians in educational labs(?) in your country, because they don't get any suitable jobs. [break] ...their so many departments will be closed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's possible in India but not in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The American people are... They consider it backwards. <span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has to be educated, that backward is real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They think they have achieved a higher standard of freedom by traveling all over the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is your freedom? Where is your freedom if for your livelihood you have to go a hundred miles? Where is your freedom? Why you are illusioned? For your bread, you have to go hundred miles off, either by car or by train. So where is your freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The freedom is in leisure time. They have a lot of leisure time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is leisure time? You rise early in the morning and start for your office. Where is your leisure time? All imagination. I have seen in New York. They are coming from the other parts, starting early in the morning, two hours in the ferry and two hours in the cars, and standing two hours. What is this? Leaders, rich men, can think like that, that "I have leisure," but a worker, lower class, they have no freedom. That is illusion, and we are trying to give freedom to everyone. That is freedom. You are forced to go to the factory and work there in a hellish condition of life. Is that freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There must be still education so the people will... Say we are one day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No education, no. Education will be required only for the guiding class: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas,</span> not for anyone, <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They are two only. Others will... What education required? Suppose if you produce... If you..., you are accustomed to agriculture, cow protection, there is no need going to college and schools. If you remain illiterate, still you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But in America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, America is not... I am talking of the (indistinct), the class who will guide the aim of life, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class, and a class that will give them protection from injuries by others, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> class. Then the next class, food-producing men, they do not require. Actually only <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they require education, or all others, they will simply see and learn. So little education required-that you can learn by hearing only, that's all. Suppose a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class says that "This is good; this is bad." So you hear and accept. It doesn't require to go to school and college. So education will be simplified. [break] It has become very much complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have given too much power to the people, so the people demand so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they're suffering. Ordinary people, what they'll do? <span class="Italic">Anarthas.</span> Actually it is <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> They have created so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are very much afraid if we close down the gambling houses and the prostitution houses that there will be no more enjoyment. Life will be boring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "What we'll do?" (laughter) So we shall give you opportunity to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance here. (train stops) What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It seems that if one day the Kṛṣṇa conscious movement has actually achieved some powerful position in America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...we will have to tolerate all these things-cinema, nightclubs. How can we close all these things? The people <span class="Italic">want</span> these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you educate people, if you give them better enjoyment, they'll give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very gradual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like our men. They are not after cinema or brothel house or restaurants. It requires education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to make them devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But can all the masses of people become devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, cent percent devotees, by this process: ask them to chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> People in general are very much inclined to accept whoever their leader is if they feel happy. So if we give them <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> if their economic needs are met, then how can they avoid? Economic needs are the main thing. That's why they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they can eat nicely and they have no complaint for living conditions, they will become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they will not give up sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I don't say that you give up sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That means that they want to have nice clothing and cars for sex. As soon as there is sex, then they want so many other things to make it more attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. Not necessarily. Formerly there was sex life. They're thinking like that, "We require," naturally. First of all they'll be... If they advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they will stop sex life. <span class="Italic">Yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa...</span> If they're really Kṛṣṇa conscious, they'll have no more taste for sex life. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But that position is not very easily attainable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not easy. Therefore we say, "Restrict this." And this will be possible if he follows our program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You have said many times that if a small percentage of the Americans become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then the whole country can gradually become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that means that in the beginning we may be very powerful in government, but still, the masses of people will be <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You can introduce in such a way that they will become devotees. Suppose in big, big factories we shall introduce this <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution and chanting. They'll immediately be popular. Everything will be... <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In order for us to get power, by that time the illumination and knowledge of Kṛṣṇa consciousness will be widespread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's what I'm wondering. I was thinking that it wouldn't be. There would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Otherwise how can we get through? What is the use of having one politician?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many revolutions have been victorious with a very small minority of people behind them because they're so well organized. Russia, Germany, all these revolutions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In history there is examples of small groups of people taking over a government because they are very intelligent and very well organized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And the mass of people did not believe in them, but still, they took over the government. Like in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But Kṛṣṇa consciousness knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Russia, the mass of people aloof from this rascal theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are not Communists, the mass of people. The Communist party itself is very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very small. By terrorism there will be, by terrorism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So when the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement becomes so powerful that it is in charge of the government, is it because of a small group of people or because of a mass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is due to quality of the leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But will it be like Russia where there is only a small group of people who are Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not that. The quality of the people will be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that means the whole mass population...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Only then will Kṛṣṇa conscious government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You can have government when you are in even minority. But the mass of people, on account of this quality, will have to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The idea is to convince them that what they need is good quality leaders, that not necessarily that they already have to become to that stage themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be appreciated by any man because it's very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simple and it is natural also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The desire for good leadership is there, so if we present good leaders, then they'll naturally take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our leaders must be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means we have to move into political circles (train starts moving) and do a lot of preaching on there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you work strictly on your principles, then everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America there is a rule that there is separation of church and government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they think of us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not stereotyped church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they think of us as a religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may think. It is not the fact. It is a culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For example, this group, this new record, Golden Avatar record...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be for a certain class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It can become very popular, but if they find out it is Hare Kṛṣṇa, they will think it is religion and they will not buy it. But if we do not mention that it is Hare Kṛṣṇa right at the beginning...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Either you mention or not mention, unless they realize that it is good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, that they'll realize when they hear it. Just like our book distributors. They're not dressing as Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees; therefore they are successful. As soon as the people see that they are Hare Kṛṣṇa devotees, they do not want religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Suppose a military dress... Then there are different dresses. When it is understood properly, dress is immaterial. The military dress... Everyone knows that their business is to kill. That does not mean they are hated. Similarly, people see, and when they understand, that is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, when Kamsa was being a little lenient with Vasudeva, Nārada Muni thought to speed things up, so he instigated Kamsa to become frightened about Vasudeva and Devaki and their children. So similarly, it appears that in order to speed up Kṛṣṇa consciousness's infiltration and overtaking this materialistic society, that all of these brainwashing charges and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has got... The chanting has got spiritual power. That will rectify everything. Even there is misunderstanding, it will be rectified. That is spiritual power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The chanting for the mass of people is by reading your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will rectify everything. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> All misunderstanding gone away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have to be very clever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America it requires being very clever to get them to read your books. Even if they buy millions of books, there's no guarantee that they're reading it. So we have to make other kinds of propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at least it is expected they will read: "What is this book I have purchased? Let me see." Reading, of course, meant for intelligent class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, just like this radio show, there were so many things said, but at the end, even the man who was blaspheming said, "Well, I guess we'll just have to read your books and find out what it's about." So if people hear a (sic:) controvity and we're arguing one way, they argue another way, then if the book's there, they'll naturally want to read it just to see actually what's the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are starting a new radio show again in America. Formerly we had a show called "The Kṛṣṇa Show." So we're starting it again, and it will be nationwide. And there will be a lot of controversy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have to take advantage of the modern medium of publicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Radio and even television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Everyone watches television. If they see it on television it is-"That's a fact."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to show how we are eating, how we are sleeping, how we are talking. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The only hope is if Kṛṣṇa gives us the intelligence-because we're so stupid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa has already given you. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekāṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is simple truth. Believe in Kṛṣṇa. That means Supreme Personality of Godhead. Whatever He says is truth. That's all. This is intelligence: "Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, that is truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even if one is not so clever, still, if he simply repeats and presents Kṛṣṇa, then that's enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Firm faith. Firm faith: "Whatever Kṛṣṇa says is all right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because ultimately Kṛṣṇa is the doer of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa sudṛḍha niścaya.</span> This is basic platform, that "What Kṛṣṇa says, that is truth." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya:</span> "If I follow Kṛṣṇa, then my business is complete." This is intelligence. Now... We have come to the open field. How it is nice. And so long we were passing through that congested areas-hellish, simply hellish. And now here is open space. How it is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To enter into a city is so imposing on your consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to that point, simply rubbish, all papers thrown here and there. People are living in... Now see here, how it is open and pleasing. Organize this farm project. Farm. (background talking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's just saying that in the West one requires a great deal of capital. To start a farm, to get the land, you need a lot of money because land is very expensive. And also we have to use modern farming techniques because we have so few men to run the farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you show example. People will do automatically. When the people find it is very nice, they will take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Should we try to make an effort to have our householders go and live on the farms, a special effort? If it's ready to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why householders? Everyone. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America there is a very big emphasis on getting people to join us by moving into our temples. The temple presidents are very eager to get as many people to move in as possible, but in the long run most people cannot come up to the standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am... Farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they have to be encouraged to have a little bit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness in their own home, make their home a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, let them go to the farm, New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many people... Most people in the world, they are <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhīs,</span> and they cannot give it up so easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No, you remain... Come here with your wife, children. You remain <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> New Vrindaban is very austere. If we build little bungalows with modern convenience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There has to be some modern convenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Then we shall do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But for many people who live in the cities, they have their jobs already. They don't want to give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (train slows down) What is the nonsense? No, there is a station? No station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why does this train keep stopping? (train stops)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why does the train keep stopping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is this gentleman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pradyumna?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Pradyumna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Say, in America, most people live in the cities, and they already have their job, and they are set in their ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you said that there is unemployment also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> To a certain extent. But there are still 250,000,000 people. So most of them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those who are unemployed, let them come to us. We shall give them employment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. But for the mass population...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, gradually you will increase and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have to give them something that they can do in their home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because it is impractical to think that they will give up everything and move into the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, those who are unemployed, let them come. We shall give them employment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> On the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For those who are unemployed, that's attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But for those who are already employed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But most people have jobs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many people already have their jobs and their families.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, let them not come, but those who are unemployed, let them come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But what...? For those people who already have their jobs, instead of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That job... They will be very soon jobless. Don't worry. (laughs) They will come. They will be obliged to come. Now they have got job, but as the days are advancing in Kali-yuga, they'll be jobless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So we can expect that material conditions are going to become very much worse than this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may come or not. We don't care for it. Let us establish an ideal society. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> If someone who is well-off wants to become a devotee, shall we encourage him to give up all of his material well-being or shall we ask him to instead put a temple in his house and encourage him how to make his house into a temple and make his whole family Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is your material well-being? Everyone is going hundred miles for well-being. Is that well-being? Either they may go by motorcar or by train... And as soon as there is-what is called?-bottle-neck, they become very much disturbed: "How to go to the office?" Where is well-being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Say, the Christian religion... The Christian religion has millions of followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the meaning of these followers? They do not understand anything. Simply by rubber-stamp they are follower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But if we can get a mass following, it is only possible by preaching to them little bit at a time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By your ideal life, ideal teaching, you'll get. This Christian or any religion, what is the use of that? It's not at all religion. It's simply rubber-stamp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. But if we had many people, then gradually we could help them become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But I think they all... One thing that scares people is that we ask too much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...at the beginning. We are asking too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So if we ask just a little bit, then gradually we increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, little bit we say, that "You come, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> "And read our books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose you are illiterate, you cannot. But you can do this-"Come here, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is a big misunderstanding in America. People think that to be a Hare Kṛṣṇa you have to give up everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... Yes, you have to give up everything which is bad. Do you think drinking is very good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (chuckling) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if I say, "You have to give it up," so what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they feel that unless they give up everything all at once, they cannot become members of the Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you'll automatically give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Gradually he'll automatically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (train starts to move again) First thing is to begin the positive process. Then the negative process will follow along.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. If he understands it is very nice to chant, dance, and take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> they'll give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many people think that if you become a Hare Kṛṣṇa you have to shave your head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But it scares them and it keeps them from joining us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you save so much barbers' expenses. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So much inconvenience for washing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are misunderstandings that confuse people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole life is misunderstanding, material life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But we want them to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's the main thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are envious of us? When we live very nicely, they are envious that "These people do not do anything, and they are living so nicely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They will not be so envious if they see that people who dress in Western style and keep their families and keep their jobs are also chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We say... We say that, that we simply say, that "You change your consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not change your dress, but change your consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we never said. If you prefer that kind of dress, costly, you prefer it, but we are simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's our choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> As a person becomes more purified, then he'll simplify himself anyway. And if he really cultivates a desire to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, nowadays coat-pant is very costly. If you can spend your money, costly dress, we have no objection. Then you have to earn more; you have to work more. Therefore we are simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ultimately, it is the best thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they want to come in that dress, come in. If you want, come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I have been studying this record business in the last month or two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I've been studying the record business in America. People spend more money on records than they do on books. In general people are buying more records than books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Give them some seat. Is there any carpet? Bring something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What time do you want to take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? It's 8:25 now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whenever... You take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, we'll all take in that other carriage, and you can eat undisturbed. I'll remain here or whatever you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may take little later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, we can take later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So I found out that people spend more money on records than on books in America. That means that if we sell our record in the store, it can bring us a lot of income. In general, people spend more money on records.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you get more income. For using it, let them come and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Don't accumulate money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get money and spend it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> distribution is the best thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There was a big parade in Los Angeles called the Rose Bowl, one million people. So we made ten thousand bags of peanuts and raisins and called it "Govinda's Nuts 'n' Raisins." We were tossing it to the crowd, and they were going, "Hare Kṛṣṇa! Here! Kṛṣṇa!" They were begging for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We could have passed out <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> for one million people if we had had enough money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Earn money like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It costs a lot of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Either produce food in the farm or earn money and purchase, but give <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We saw it, that they know it was Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> and they were standing up in the crowds, "Kṛṣṇa! Here!" and begging for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) So they have at least chanted "Kṛṣṇa." That is our profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And everyone liked it. And we were giving it out for free. That they very much appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Everyone else is taking their money, but when we give them <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> for free, they very much appreciate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that. There is no need of accumulating money and pay income tax and botheration. Spend it. Always remain empty pocket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So I was thinking to develop this record group so we can make lots of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You make lots of money and spend lots of money. Don't keep it in the pocket. What is the use of keeping? No income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So our only interest is to spend it as fast as we get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spend it for distribution. They'll say, "Kṛṣṇa, give us <span class="Italic">prasāda!</span>" And that is our triumph. They chant and "Kṛṣṇa." That's all right. "Take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So I'm encouraging them to make more records like the "Change of Heart."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not dry, simply talking philosophy. "Take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Eat sumptuously."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if people become followers of a particular music group, then they take their message and their life-style very seriously. Just like when the people were following the Beatles, and then the Beatles became involved with meditation, so this made it very popular in America. If the group becomes... If the music group becomes popular, then whatever they do, everyone follows. So I am thinking that we can make this music group, Golden Avatar, very popular. Then everyone will find out that they believe in reincarnation and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and everyone will follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, something "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa" music must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now, to make this group very popular, they have to have Western dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And they have to have long hair or wigs, or else they grow it. But somehow or other, they cannot be shaven-headed Hare Kṛṣṇaś.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Long hair is not... We should not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have to have wigs then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why wigs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because in America all the musicians have hair, because that way people become attracted to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we cannot take hair. That is not possible. We cannot become hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, not hippies. So then, rather than growing their hair, they should wear wigs. Just like our book distributors do not grow their hair long, but they wear wigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But do you mean to say unless you have long hairs, they will not hear your song?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Medium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not. If they like your song, it doesn't matter whether you have long hairs or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The main thing is they cannot be wearing <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> and shaved head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But when they make public appearances, they have to be in disguise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make public to become gentlemen. Formerly they had no long hairs. They dressed like gentlemen. That we cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So it doesn't have to be very long. But I don't think it will become popular unless they are in disguise, wearing Western clothes and a little bit of hair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. But formerly your father, grandfather, they had no long hair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, they will not dress like hippie. They will dress nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is allowed. But we cannot imitate the hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. I'm just saying that it is a little difficult if they wear their <span class="Italic">dhotī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span><span class="Italic"> </span>No, <span class="Italic">dhotī,</span> I don't say. You have nice coat-pant. I don't say that you have to... I never said that. You have adopted it. (laughs) I never said that "You put on <span class="Italic">dhotī.</span>" But those who are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs, brahmacārīs,</span> their dress is different. But it doesn't require that one has to become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The wigs he's suggesting are just short ones, short hair wigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yeah. As long as it's not hippy, it is all right. It has to be attractive. Gentlemen. I have taken this record, "Change of Heart," to the biggest record companies in America, and they are very encouraging. They think that we have got a very wonderful message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are astonished at the..., the words to the songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think if this group is... If this is done...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāra lāgi.</span> Our message is to kill the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is wonderful message, undoubtedly. <span class="Italic">Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāra lāgi, hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi:</span> "Take this <span class="Italic">hari-nāma.</span>" It is very important message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In America, say a music group becomes popular, very popular. Then automatically, every time they make their record album, one million people will buy it in the stores without any salesmen. Automatically one million. It's considered very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So make records "Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And for each record our profit is $2.50. So $2.50 times one million records becomes millions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spend it for <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> distribution. Don't squander it. Every cent should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa, not for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now, some of the money could be sent to India for ISKCON Food Relief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That would be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That will make our movement very popular in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're always complaining that there's not enough money for food distribution in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So kindly send me as much as possible. Therefore these farming projects will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That'll be great, if we can use the money... Do you think I should set up a separate account for the records, so that all the profit is used for food distribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that will be a special means of raising money for <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This idea will be very popular with the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So now you can distribute...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasāda...</span> (indistinct) [break] (train stops)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the British propaganda, that they came to India and made India more civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is civilization, that running, congested, hanging on. These rascals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their famous phrase was "The white man's burden."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless they made such propaganda, how they could stay? They must give some plea that "I am staying for their benefit." That was the propaganda all through. And any Indian who would agree to say in the League of Nations and when there is conference, "Yes, we are so much benefited," he would be made secretary, governor. The flatterer, he would be made governor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they kicked the British out, but they still have the British system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have learned this. They have been accustomed... And by nature they are not, I mean to say, dovetailed to this system of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Somehow or another, they just can't do it. They can't live like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now we are going to <span class="Italic">Kumbha Mela,</span> a religious assemble. In the Western countries you don't find so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. In the 1960's in America they tried to have such assemblies, but they simply were becoming naked and having drugs-LSD, marijuana-in the name of spiritual festival. I remember very prominent festivals in America, but everyone was simply naked. They thought that was spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naked? Fully naked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They would hold the festivals sometimes in the hills with a stream. It was very popular; everybody would go to the stream and bathe naked. And then the TV would come and film. There was one big one that they had in England, and the front pages on all the newspapers was one hippie couple that... Someone had spread some foam everywhere, and in the middle of the foam this hippie couple were naked having sex, and they put the picture in all the papers. This was love and peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen John...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> John Lennon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...naked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Naked. With his wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That picture is in his sitting room. I was talking with him in his sitting room, and fireplace and... Of course, that Chandler Place(?), a very big and glorious picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's changed. America has given that up a little bit. They do not have these big gatherings anymore. The hippie movement in America is stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the next movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. They're just waiting now. They are waiting for something to happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All these religious, what they call the religious cults, came immediately after the hippies. That's the big thing now. There was the growth period for those. Now they're trying to destroy them. Of course, they won't destroy us, but they've succeeded in one or two other groups. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...below one person.(?) In the name of religious men, because they are not civilized even, it is further, further. This is going on. Actually there was no such...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And another thing that came out of the hippie movement is this abortion. Because the whole thing... The slogan was "free sex." So now they have free sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Women's liberation was another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> All based on sex. Abortion, divorce-everything related to sex has increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They used to carry signs, "I want the control of my body," the women, the women's liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is woman's liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah. "I can do with my body whatever I like. Nobody can tell me what to do. If I want to kill my child, I can kill." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The child has father's..., the life from father's property, and the mother is only giving you shelter. She is not the proprietor. Even in other's, womb of other's wife, a child is born... I give birth to a child in other's wife, that is my child. Mother is considered the field, <span class="Italic">kṣetra.</span> But when I till the <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> field, the production is mine. This idea. The land may be yours, but if I plow on it and produce food grains, that is mine. That is not yours. This is the... Even in other's wife, if somebody begets child, the child belongs to the father. There are many instances. [break] <span class="Italic">Mat-prāṇa-nāthas:</span> "Still, you are My Lord." That is love. "My love is conditional. If you do to my liking, then I love you"-that is not love. That is not love; that is business. That business is going on under the name of love. A man and woman-"If you have got pocket filled up with money, I love you. If you have got beauty, then I love you." That is not love. That is lust! They do not know what is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have no idea of actually who is God or what is God. They don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They make God under his condition. That is not God. God cannot be under your condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> God cannot have sixteen thousand wives. God cannot appear at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that if God had all of these things, then He would have revealed them in the Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you cannot, rascal, manage that. That is the difference between him and God. Kṛṣṇa had sixteen thousand wives and sixteen thousand palaces. You cannot maintain one apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the Bible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You tell them like that: "You are so poor that you are afraid to maintain even one wife. So how you can be equal with God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> His argument was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No argument! This is fact!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, this is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. He's not arguing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do. You are so poor that you are afraid to marry because you have to take so much responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He wants to know, then, why didn't Jesus Christ say all these things about Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus may be fool. That doesn't mean everyone should be fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They believe Jesus came to this world to teach people about God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Jesus... Jesus had to speak to rascals and fools like you. Therefore he did not speak." This is the argument. "Because you are such a fool that Jesus said, 'Thou shall not kill'-your first business was to kill him. So you are so nice, advanced men. Now, what he'll speak to you? He knew that you are all rascals. Even the one word you cannot understand, 'Thou shall not kill.' So what you will understand? Therefore Jesus Christ did not say." Give them this answer. Jesus Christ was perfect, but because you are rascals, he did not say, because you could not understand even his one word. You are so intelligent. His commandment is "Thou shall not kill," but your business is to kill him first. How far you are advanced and civilized, just imagine. And you want perfect instruction. You cannot follow even one instruction. That is your position. In this way try to understand. "Jesus had to deal with rascals like you. Therefore he... Even ordinary moral principles, you could not, what to speak of other things." Actually that is the fact. Actually that is the fact. He had to deal with rascals and fools. Is that civilization, that first of all argue, "Thou shall not kill"? That means you were all rascals engaged in killing business. Is that civilized men? Why he said like that? Is that very good philosophy? Mean they were so low class that they had to be stopped first of all, these sinful activities. That also, they could not. This is their position. And for the last two thousand years they could not. Such nice brain. They could not understand even one instruction of Jesus Christ. And you are proud of becoming Christian, rascals. "You do not know what is Christianity, what is Jesus Christ. You are all rascals." Tell them like that. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's indefeatable, undefeatable argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You could not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Thou shall not kill..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although he spoke very cautiously, still you could not do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Thou shall not commit adultery."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a very good counterattack, that "You try to criticize us, but actually what is <span class="Italic">your</span> position?" They have no position. That man, he was trying to criticize Kṛṣṇa as being a concoction or whatever, but we can practically see that his own religion is completely useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that also I have given. Kṛṣṇa might have hundreds and thousands, but where is the pregnancy and contraception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if sex life without this botheration, it is welcome. We welcome that. Sex is enjoyment; that is all right. But here it is condemned because it is entailed with so many botherations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can practically establish both points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like sex life is enjoyment, but a person who is suffering from tuberculosis-his death. He'll die if he indulges in sex life. That is medical science. "So it is condemned in the material world, not in the spiritual world. If you have good health, you can enjoy sex life. But you have tuberculosis? You'll die. Your sex life is death, and their sex life is life. That you cannot understand. You have such a poor brain that you could not follow even ordinary moral instruction of Jesus Christ." Answer should be given like that. "If you remain with your poor brain, don't try to argue. Be satisfied, your poor doggish brain, hoggish brain. You are like pigs and dogs. What you can understand about religion? First of all try to train yourself to be free from the sinful activities. Then you'll understand what is religion." <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> Ultimately, a person, sinful man, cannot go to the kingdom of God. Is it not? First of all stop this sex life; then talk of God. It is a fact. When the order of Jesus Christ, "Thou shall not kill," for the last two thousand years the rascals have never stopped killing. They are simply increasing slaughterhouse. And... So they are so poor in understanding, they say animal has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is their excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who cares for this excuse? It is not scientific. Is there any difference, anatomy and physiology, of the animals and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They do not know what the soul means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Now, when there is opportunity, condemn them like anything. It is opportunity to expose them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We should do that, expose them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not? When they are attacking, you must attack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Attack them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is very practical: "Yes, Kṛṣṇa enjoyed sex. But where is abortion? Where is contraceptive pill?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, by practical example we can show that by following Kṛṣṇa, so many people are giving up intoxication, giving up so many sinful activities. But by following your Christian religion, it's not done them any good whatsoever. It's not changed their lives whatsoever. This man, he described our movement as very dangerous. On the radio he said, "This is dangerous," because we're trying to establish Kṛṣṇa as God and He's not stated in the Bible, and therefore we are very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christ is described as son of God, but where is the father? That means you are so rascal, you do not care to understand the father. And we are presenting the father, the father of Christ. And you are condemning. You do not know who is the father of Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His argument was that if God wanted Himself to be known as Kṛṣṇa, He would have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not know the meaning of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means "all-attractive." That is God. That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. I tried to explain. But he said Kṛṣṇa means that person who appeared in India five thousand years ago. That is Kṛṣṇa. So he said if God is Kṛṣṇa, then there would be some evidence in the Bible, but there is no evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is ev... There is evidence. Because... But you are so fool that you do not inquire, "If the Christ is son of God, who is God?" They never inquires. Why did you not inquire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He said that God spoke to Moses. God did not tell Moses that He was Kṛṣṇa. He told Moses that He is Jehovah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did Christ say that "Jehovah is my father"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That makes it very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I can't remember ever seeing... Jesus never used a name. He only spoke about "my father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is that father? Why did you not...? So here is the father. You should be obliged to us that we are bringing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There are so many names anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why not Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, exactly. Just like Allah means "the great one," so Kṛṣṇa means "the all-attractive one." It's the same God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa was proved, and still He is proved. Who is reading others' book all over the world? Therefore He is God. Where is that book so respected as <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Who is printing so many books? Not even Bible. They respected Bible. Why the foreigners are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> That is the proof that Kṛṣṇa is God. During the Christmas festival we sold our books greatest number in the history. How many copies Bible you have sold? That is the proof. Here is God. Otherwise why Christians should purchase <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> during Christmas holiday? And because Kṛṣṇa is God, therefore you have come to fight. Who is going to fight with Jehovah? Who is going to fight with Jehovah movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, just like in the Middle East area, if they want to describe God or if they want to glorify God, they refer to Him as the Almighty One. And that word that means "Almighty One" is <span class="Italic">Allah.</span> So if in India they want to glorify God by calling Him the All-attractive One, and that word is <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa,</span> then what is the wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a problem. Because they're such <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> as soon as there's a name and a form, they immediately associate with material nature, material personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give me little tangerine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tangerine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was just telling Jagadīśa that you said you were confident that the Indian government understands that this movement is turning the whole world towards Indian culture. So it seems logical that one day it will endorse us.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> President was therefore kicked out. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has kicked out on his face. (laughter) Who cares for Radhakrishnan? In India, who cares for Radhakrishnan? They worship Kṛṣṇa. So therefore they have urinated on the face of Radhakrishnan. Say like that, (laughter) that "Indian people have passed urine on his head, and they are worshiping Kṛṣṇa. This is Radhakrishnan." Tell him like that. "Who cares for Radhakrishnan?" Do you mean to say they have stopped worshiping Kṛṣṇa in so many millions of temples? That is the proof: they have passed urine on the face of Radhakrishnan. Is that all right?</div>

You are... Your brain is filled up with all rubbish things: meat-eating and illicit sex, gambling. So we are washing them. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].

The bad things should be washed off. Don't you cleanse your home? Don't you cleanse your room? Is not that brainwashing? So if you wash your room very cleansed, who blames you? But you are so rascal that "Why you are washing this garbage?" you are protesting. You are such an intelligent man. We are washing the garbage; you are protesting, "Why you are washing the garbage?" This is your intelligence. But intelligent men wash the garbage. That is the law of nature, cleanse. That we are doing. According to Vedic civilization, you are actually untouchable. Now we have come to touch you; therefore wash you must first. You are untouchable. In Indian civilization, dog is untouchable, and that is your best friend. So you are not touchable. Therefore we have to wash you. And unless your brain is washed, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. So it is necessary. Is that all right? Dog is your best friend. In India dog is untouchable. So "Man is known by his company." If your best friend is dog, then what you are? We can understand your position because you sleep with dog, you eat with dog, your best friend is dog, so what you are? You must be washed. It is a fact. Every woman, every man, has some dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Dog or cat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mostly dog. So "Man is known by his company." Your constant company is dog, so what you are? These are the way. Actually, according to Vedic... Why they do not allow Europeans in the Jagannātha temple? Because they are untouchable. According to Vedic civilization, Europeans are untouchable. Muslims and..., untouchable. Not only foreigners, even in their own country, those who are not very cleansed, they are untouchable. Another's eatable things, they're untouchable. Just like hog. If you give him <span class="Italic">halavā,</span> he will not take it. He will eat stool. Therefore hog is so abominable. Similarly, in your country there are so many nice foodstuffs. Milk is so abundant. You do not know how to utilize milk. You are cutting the poor animal and the rotten flesh you are... You do not know how to utilize the milk. Milk is nothing but blood. Those who are eating, drinking milk with different varieties of preparation, they are also utilizing the blood. But you are drinking blood and flesh directly. You do not know how to keep the animals alive and supply you constantly the blood and eat it.(?) (Utilize?) That you do not know. You are so uncivilized. The man in the jungle, they eat meat because they do not know-they are not civilized-how to utilize the by-products. So you're now in the same position. You do not know how to utilize the blood of cow scientifically. You are so uncivilized. You become... What is milk? The milk is nothing but blood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Even in the Bible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Apart from Bible, I am speaking from practical point of view. What is milk? Milk is blood. If the mother is unhealthy, anemic, you cannot keep. It dries away.(?) Milk is transformed from the blood. That's a fact. Now our cows in New Vrindaban, they are supplying more milk than in other farms. So you do not know how to utilize blood. You are so uncivilized. And you are claiming to be civilized. You are untouchable. You do not know what is the... Yes, in our New Vrindaban the men from other farms, they come. They are surprised. "Milk can give, this much?"(?) You know that? They are uncivilized, cutthroat. And therefore they are now eating better. You are not civilized. Don't talk of anything. First of all be civilized. Give up sin, sinful activities. Then come to understand what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book you describe that the only person who can't understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the killer of the cow.</div>

<div class="After-Verse"> Unless one is animal-killer, everyone welcomes God. This very word is used, <span class="Italic">vinā paśughnāt.</span> Excepting these persons who are animal killers, everyone will welcome Kṛṣṇa. It is so nasty thing, animal-killing. So you require thoroughly to be washed. Then you'll understand. Actually it is brainwashing. Civilized man, in the presence of so many nice grains, fruits, flowers, vegetables, milk, so many things, and you are eating meat like the man in the jungle? Are you civilized? Does it mean that the fruit, flowers and grains is meant for animals? It is meant for human beings. You do not know how to utilize it. You are in the state of the animals. You kill animals and eat. Don't claim that you are civilized. Therefore your brain requires to be thoroughly washed to become civilized. Therefore your brain requires to be thoroughly washed to become civilized, Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then talk of civilization. Therefore Jesus Christ first of all requested you "Don't kill." That is also brainwash, cleanse your brain. But you could not take the brainwash. Your brain is congested with so much dirty things that you could not take the instruction of Jesus Christ, and you claim to be Christian. Be ashamed. Don't come forward. Be ashamed. You have no shame even. You are so-what is called?-fool that you do not know what is defective. What is that English proverb? "Fools rush in where angels dare not." You are such a fool that you are running in to obstruct Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is... Even the demigods, they aspire after it. You are such a fool. You are rushing in. So we take pity upon you, and therefore we are trying to expand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But be sane; don't talk insanity. [break] And here you see big, big scholars that "Yes, here is Indian statement for the whole..." There are many saintly persons. Who cares for your Bible? And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> all over the world... Even if you take Dr. Radhakrishnan, elected as authority, he has tried to comment on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> not on your Bible. Has he done? Who cares for your Bible? He may speak favorably or unfavorably, that is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But he has not spoken a word upon the Bible. Who cares for you? Not only here, all over the world, who is going to take the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> er, Bible?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must. "No, you have taken Dr. Radhakrishnan authority. Has he commented on Bible? Why not? That is not even worth commenting on." You have to attack like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If President Nixon had written a commentary on the Bible, no one in America would accept it. Then why should they accept Radhakrishnan's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Radhakrishnan may say so, but who has accepted? You are, because you are a fool. Same argument, that people have passed urine on his face, and they are worshiping. They have not stopped Kṛṣṇa worshiping because Radhakrishnan has said, restriction. (?) Who cares for him? Vṛndāvana, there are five thousand temples. Every day thousands of people are coming. We have started Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple very recently, and thousands of men are coming. Who cares for Radhakrishnan? <span class="Italic">Daye mane nāpa ni more (?)</span> "Nobody cares for him; he becomes leader." What is the value of such leader? If somebody cares for that person, then he's leader. Nobody cares for him? He's leader for you because you are a rascal. You do not know anything. So he may be leader for men like you, but India... Nobody cares for him. Is it not? Who cares for Radhakrishnan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nobody mentions Radhakrishnan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cares for Vivekananda? Who cares for Dayananda? Nobody cares. They are doing their own business. Still, daily two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of contributions in Vaikuṇṭhanātha temple, Tirupati, still. Who is paying their money? Ordinary payers. Who cares for Radhakrishnan? India is not so fool that by the words of Radhakrishnan they will stop worshiping Kṛṣṇa, will not worship Kṛṣṇa. India, although poverty-stricken, illiterate, but they have got their still... All, millions of people, will come in this <span class="Italic">Mela.</span> Who cares for Radhakrishnan? There are so many atheists came and gone, things are going on as it is.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now in the Western countries, the standard of culture and education is coming from the idea of the Renaissance in Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not culture. That is not culture. As soon as you change, that means it is not culture. It is <span class="Italic">mano-dharma,</span> mental concoction. Culture is never changed, Renaissance and (sic:) Fennaissance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is something that has been constant for many hundreds of years, the idea that a man is learned when he is well-learned, when he is educated in many different fields-literature, art, music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That does not mean the original culture will be lost. That is not culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. But this is their argument, that the standard in America is that you become learned in different fields: science, music, art, literature. But in our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement we are isolating all these things and simply reading one set of literature-Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We want to stop your nonsense. That is our mission. Those who are intelligent, they have taken. And you also take. It will take some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Another big argument is regarding the children. They say that "You believe in free choice.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have become Kṛṣṇa conscious from the very beginning. That is the perfection of life. They are perfect from the very beginning of their life. And you are going to school, college; you are becoming most uncivilized, cats and dogs. So what is the value of this education? <span class="Italic">Phalena</span> means result. Result is hippie. So what is the use of Western... Stop all these colleges and universities. The sooner they are stopped, it is better for the human beings. We want to stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Of course, if we tell them that, then they will think that we are anarchists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you say that we want to stop this nonsense, that is the name of education producing hippies. We want to stop it. You may take us whatever you like. We want gentlemen, not this hogs' and dogs' naked dance. You are hogs and dogs; you accept. But we cannot accept. We are birds of the same feather. We are cleansed. Let them become hogs and dogs. But the civilized(?) thing must go on. So we want to stop this. Is that education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now they say if we are thinking of our members to be gentlemen, then why is it when they go to the airports they are bothering so many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not bothering; they are educating. You take... A rascal, when he is advised... A thief when he's advised, "Kindly do not become a thief," he takes it botheration, but that is good advice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say it is invasion of privacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Why privacy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say every man has the right to think the way he wants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore I have go the right to think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So if I don't want to hear your philosophy, why are you imposing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not imposing. It is good philosophy. We are canvassing, "Take it. You'll be benefited." And they are being benefited. Those who are reading, they are being benefited. Just like we are canvassing. We are Americans. You are not benefited. Therefore you are... Our Guru Mahārāja, Indian, he is not coming. We are doing, because we are benefited. We know we are benefited. Therefore it must be spread. That is our success. "Good thing must be given." Why you are advertising big, big order(?), "Please come and purchase Ford car," "Purchase Chevrolet car"? Yearly. Why you are canvassing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because we think it is nice. To make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Why you are imposing your so-called goodness to others and spending so much money? Why you are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is not physical. It is just mental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, physical, mental... That's right. You are so intelligent that you make distinction between physical and mental. They're all manifestation(?). You are so intelligent. Without mental, is there any physical? Then why you engage psychologist? There may be physical madman. Why you take him at psychologist? Why? Now you're discriminating mental and physical. If mental has nothing to do with physical, then why you employ psychologist to cure a madman from physical violence? You are so fool. Without mental pain, there is no physical pain. Without mental derangement, there is no physical disturbance. Who commits suicide? Who commits murder unless he's mentally deranged? You are very intelligent, that you want to make differentiation between physical and mental. There is differentiation. But cure physically.(?) Naturally they'll become sound. Otherwise why so many psychologists, psychiatrists, are employed in your country?</div>

Still, we have to do this Kṛṣṇa's business. So we have to do our business. Let the dogs bark on. We don't care for it. If we remain sincere to Kṛṣṇa, that is our victory, not the result. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana.</span> We have to act according to direction of Kṛṣṇa, that much. We want to see good result. Even there is no good result, we don't mind. We must be sincere to Kṛṣṇa that "We have done our best." That's all. Without cheating Kṛṣṇa. That is our duty. As servant, we shall not cheat the master. Result, no result-that depends on Kṛṣṇa. We should not be sorry if there is not result. Never mind. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "I have brought to Benares <span class="Italic">hari-nāma,</span> but here they are full of Māyāvādīs. So if it is not sold, all right, I shall take it back." Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. So we should not be anxious whether the things are sold or not. But we must do our best canvassing work: "Please take it." That is our duty. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...<span class="Italic">mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara:</span> "Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed. Otherwise, work binds one to this material world. Therefore, O son of Kunti, perform your prescribed duties for His satisfaction, and in that way you will always remain unattached and free from bondage." Should I read the purport? Purport. "Since one has to work even for the simple maintenance of the body, the prescribed duties for a particular social position and quality are so made that the purpose can be fulfilled. Yajña means Lord Viṣṇu or sacrificial performances. All sacrificial performances also are meant for the satisfaction of Lord Viṣṇu. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> enjoin: <span class="Italic">yajño vai viṣṇuḥ.</span> In other words, the same purpose is served whether one performs prescribed <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> or directly serves Lord Viṣṇu. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is therefore performance of <span class="Italic">yajña</span> as it is prescribed in this verse. The <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> institution also aims at this for satisfying Lord Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Varnāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58] (<span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> 3.8.8.). Therefore one has to work for the satisfaction of Viṣṇu. Any other work done in this material world will be a cause of bondage, for both good and evil work have their reactions, and any reaction binds the performer. Therefore one has to work in Kṛṣṇa consciousness to satisfy Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, and while performing such activities one is in a liberated stage. This is the great art of doing work, and in the beginning this process requires very expert guidance. One should therefore act very diligently under the expert guidance of a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, or under the direct instruction of Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, under whom Arjuna had the opportunity to work. Nothing should be performed for sense gratification, but everything should be done for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. This practice will not only save one from the reaction of work but will also gradually elevate one to transcendental loving service of the Lord, which alone can raise one to the kingdom of God."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something like that. They have no place to live. At night... Whole day they lie down on the street and beg and drink, and at night they pay one dollar and live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's a very small minority of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, there is? Why? You are so rich country, why? Why it is happening? Not small minority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And we have our vacations. We can travel anywhere in the world and visit, sightsee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But you cannot say that everyone is very rich. That is not... We admit your contribution, but... The other day I was saying that aeroplane is contribution, but it is not safe. So long it is flying, it is all right, but any moment... Similarly, this civilization will be contribution like that. It is not safe. Because this life, you are enjoying very good house, very good society, but next life, if you are going to be a tree by nature's law, then what is the value of your this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But I believe in God. I go to church every Sunday, and I confess."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you go to church, but you don't do anything what God says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "I am taught that God gave us all of these fruits to enjoy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not to follow His advice. You are so great devotee that you simply enjoy God's gifts, but what He says, you don't follow. You are such a great devotee. "I enjoy my father's property, but I don't care for his advice." (aside:) Ask your mother to learn how to make <span class="Italic">kachoris</span> from Kulādri. Is that all right? (train slowing) Bulahanipur.(?) Somebody wrote me a letter from this place, Bulahanipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (to child) Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bol</span>!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give him something. You have got fruit? Fruit? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Ek</span> minute. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bolo</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They'll remember that Kṛṣṇa fed them. I think we should clean up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There should be a sweeper somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we do our own business. Why do you wait for sweeper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, we need a broom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take one paper, that black one there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Do you want to take rest, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (to child) Finished? It's too hot? He can't eat the <span class="Italic">samosa.</span> It's too hot. He can't eat the <span class="Italic">samosa.</span> It's too hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So is there any remaining in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Puffed rice is finished. But he can't eat the <span class="Italic">samosa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can eat. He can take this thing. Hand. Keep that paper and apply it in service. (sweeping noise) Yes. (sounds of door opening, closing, train starts again) The bathroom is free?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness is real religion. Religion cannot be "your religion" and "our religion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. They were saying in essence that only the Jew or the Christian, he can represent God. Hare Kṛṣṇa, he does not represent God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now let us talk why he cannot or why you are the only. First of all you have to ascertain what is religion. Then it will be decided who has got the stock. Let the Christian or the Jews answer this question: What is religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have no religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They do not know the answer. They'll speculate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore there is no religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Christian will say, "The Jew has no answer." And the Christian, he will say, "Religion means to accept Jesus Christ as your savior."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Because he came to earth as the son of God. He died for your sins."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore religion means what is given by God, either directly or through His son or through His servant. That is religion. So if you do not know who is God and what He has given, then where is your religion? Religion means the law given by God. So you should know who is God and what law He has given. Then you have religion. You say you do not know what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This man was saying that in the Bible there is a description of God speaking to Moses and Abraham, and He identified Himself as Jehovah, not Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the main point, that what God said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What God said? He told Abraham to go to Israel and to worship only Him. He said, "There shall be no other Gods. Just Me." And then He told Moses the Ten Commandments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God said that... God must say. So you say God: Jehovah; and we say God: Kṛṣṇa. What is the wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "The wrong is that Kṛṣṇa was a man who lived on earth five hundred thousand years ago and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Jehovah was God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means He was God, you are man, how you are hearing from Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because it's in the Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's in the Bible. Then, that whatever is the... We can say the same way, "It is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad Gītā.</span>" What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What can be said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "This is the Bible," and "This is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But history documents that Kṛṣṇa came to earth as a man."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So do you mean to say God cannot come as man? And Jehovah came as God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But in the Bible God revealed a certain aspect of Himself, and the personality of Kṛṣṇa seems to be very different from this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In which way different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Because He had all these affairs with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> He was very different."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God will be just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "And He was a king with sixteen thousand wives. That seems to be very different from the God that is described in the Bible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if God... What is described in the Bible, God symptom, that he has no power to enjoy sixteen thousand wives? He's limited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. He's unlimited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, sixteen thousand, sixteen millions He can have. Why, if He's unlimited? What is wrong there? If He's unlimited, why sixteen thousand? If He marries sixteen million, sixteen billion, still, it is not sufficient. Otherwise there is no meaning of unlimited. Why you restrict God to sixteen or one? God is under your restriction, and He's still unlimited? That means you do not know what is God. You do not know what is God. You are mistaken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But very often they will say, "It is not a question of religion that we are concerned with. It is a question of brainwashing and mind control. Your chanting so many hours a day, it's hypnotizing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what is to you? That is my business. Why do you bother yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But you are imposing it on so many young people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must impose. You impose they will not chant. That is your business. We must impose. That is my business. If you have power, you stop them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But you're not giving them a chance to think when they chant so many hours."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I give you chance? You are thieves. You are coming to kidnap. Why shall I give you chance? You say to them, as we are saying, that "You chant." They are chanting. You make brainwash. You ask them, "Don't chant." That is your business. But that you cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But by this chanting, they develop a kind of blind faith, and they stop thinking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what is to you and to your father? Let them do that. Everyone has got freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they say that that takes away freedom, because it takes away freedom to think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is a controversy, that you want to take his freedom and still, you are accusing that, that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, that's actually the fact. The want to take their freedom, but they are accusing us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if you are sane man, let us sit down. First of all ascertain what is religion. Then we shall see whether your religion is genuine or my religion is genuine. First of all ascertain. Let there be an assembly, that "What is religion?" "We say that the law given by God is religion. Now you refute this." Nobody can manufacture religion. "God is one, and whatever He has given, law, that is religion. Now you refute it?" Give them this challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Well we may accept that the Kṛṣṇa movement is a religion, but..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from name-name is not very important. In your country you say <span class="Italic">water.</span> I say <span class="Italic">jala,</span> <span class="Italic">pānīya.</span> Does it mean that because I say <span class="Italic">pānīya,</span> it will be different thing? In different countries, in different societies, things are... We say <span class="Italic">am,</span> you say <span class="Italic">mango.</span> Does it mean the thing, substance, is different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do the rascals say like that? Because we say God, Kṛṣṇa, therefore He's not. Why is... This is nonsense. I can say in my language, you can say in yours, but God is one. That you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One of their standard arguments is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this is... First of all defeat that, that "Why do you stress on name? In different countries, in different societies, the same thing may be called by different names."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, they're saying that the substance is different. Kṛṣṇa is one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The substance is different; then God... There is no God. Either Kṛṣṇa is not God, Jehovah is not God. Just like gold...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that because Kṛṣṇa displayed His activities when He was here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God will play. That is God. God is not dead. Your God is dead. Our God is alive. That is the difference. God must be alive. Why God should be dead? [break] So you are under God's control. Then you say whether Jehovah is God or Kṛṣṇa is God. First of all you must know. You must let us know what do you mean by God. If you describe, "I mean God... by the word God, I mean this," then see whether it is applicable to Jehovah or to Kṛṣṇa. It is not the name. It is the person and the symptom. Just like water is liquid. So you say <span class="Italic">water,</span> I say <span class="Italic">jal.</span> But the liquidity of water is the same. So first of all you know what is the nature of God. Then you may say "Jehovah," I may say "Kṛṣṇa," another may say something else. It doesn't matter. Water is water. That is liquid. That's all. So first of all ascertain what is the symptom of God. Can we challenge them that "What is the symptom? How do you know that here is God?" Just like we understand here is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, but their idea is all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore prove that "You are rascal, nonsense. You do not know what is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They think that God has nothing to do. He does everything by His thinking. Just like in the Bible it says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That why do you say nothing to do, rascal? That is doing. He is doing by thinking; that means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. It is said in the Bible He created the world just by His thoughts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means-that's all right-that God is so powerful that He can do by His thinking. We also admit. But that does not mean God is not doing. But He is doing in a finer way. You rascal, you do in a grosser way. God does in a finer way. But that does not mean God is inactive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And he was criticizing our description of God coming as a boar...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...and God coming as a tortoise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...and a fish, half man, half lion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He was criticizing that this is mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means you do not know what is God. God can come as He likes. That is God. But you rascal, you do not know what is God; therefore you are restricting, "He cannot come in this way." That is your restriction. Why God should be restricted? (knock) Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Gurudeva, this carriage foreman is having some message from Gupta Saheb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Namaskāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Namaskāra.</span> [break] So rascal... [break] God is unlimited, and you are a teeny man. Why you want to limit God by your dictation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says yes, it's possible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because God is unlimited, these things are possible, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you say that He cannot come as fish, He cannot...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because if He wanted us to believe in these things He would have told us on Mount Sinai, and He would have told us through Jesus Christ. Jesus said "I am the only way..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that I have already answered, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jesus Christ says, "I am the only way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. But Jesus Christ did not say to you because you are rascal. You cannot follow even his one instruction. That is the answer. It is not the foolishness of Jesus Christ. Because you are so rascal, you cannot understand it. Therefore he avoided you rascals. Because whatever he has said, you cannot follow. So what you will understand? Therefore he stopped speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They killed him after three years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are so rascal that his personal instruction is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Three years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Three years' preaching and they killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he will waste his time to rascals like you? And I understand that Jesus Christ said that "I have to say many thing, but I did not say..." like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He said, "I have more to tell that ye cannot bear."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Bear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means "you cannot understand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. He also said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Or "you cannot accept. You cannot bear."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He also said, "Do not cast your pearls before swine." I think he was talking about them also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "You are swine; so therefore he did not say." You quote this: "But you are swine; therefore he did not say."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> New interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "You are swine." Yes, they are swine. <span class="Italic">Svarka-vaca.</span>(?) In India they say. Tell them like that, "You are swine. You cannot understand things. Therefore he did not say." That's a fact. If you are not swine, then God said, "Thou shall not kill," you killed him, so what you'll understand about God? You did not allow him to live. You are such a great swine. And his disciple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Judas</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Cheated him. He was such swine. He was such big swine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And right after he was killed, anyone who followed him, they made the lions eat them. It's common knowledge that the early Christians were dragged into a big arena, and the lions were let out of their cages and devoured them. And the people were cheering. The public was invited to the event, and they were cheering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Rome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your civilization is such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mr. Gupta just sent a big basketfull of oranges from Nagpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> This is a <span class="Italic">tarshi?</span> Are they named <span class="Italic">tarshi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. [break] Therefore it is mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now, one of their arguments is... Their main thing is to try to pretend that it is not a question of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, one thing is that if you have proved a swine, what is the value of your arguments? You have proved that you are a swine. So better stop arguing. What I say, you accept. That is good for you. Because you are descendants of swine, and actually you are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually, on one television show they directly accused Your Divine Grace. They said that you have got us going out every day collecting money, and we have to send all this money to India, to Māyāpura, to build one temple so that you will become famous. And ultimately we will worship you as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, already famous. What is that famous?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was their argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. A famous man must be famous. He cannot be famous, famous. What you have done that you'll be famous? You are swine. You cannot be famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are subscribing to our newsletter. They somehow or other get our newsletter, and they read about our Māyāpura city costing so many <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">crores.</span> So they became envious. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right. We are selling books. That is my book. I can spend in such a way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It was just envy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Envy is envy. But it is my book. I am selling. So I can take the price anywhere. That is my right. You have nothing to say. You stop your men to purchase, that's all. Otherwise I'll sell anywhere and I shall spend anywhere. I have got the right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Normally they do not attack you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We are voluntarily doing all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We're voluntarily. But one of their main arguments is that before someone joins the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement he has great affection for his father, his mother, his brothers, his relatives. And after he joins the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement he has nothing to do with them anymore, and sometimes he even calls them demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they say this is the proof that we have brainwashed them. Because it is natural to have affection for your family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before that, he was accepting a false father. And now they understood that "He is not my father. He's my enemy." Therefore he's going... According to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said, "One should not become father if he cannot save his son from the imminent danger of birth, death, old age and disease." So the so-called father, they are not father. So after enter into Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, one understands that "He's my false father." So if he gives up the relationship, that means he's successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So, then they will say, "We do not want this movement in our country because it is breaking up the families."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not want? Who cares for you? We shall go on with our movement. Who cares for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "You are ruining family life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are simply ruining our families.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We are ruining the dog's family, cat's family. That's all right. We are entering into Kṛṣṇa's family. That is our improvement. What is the use of keeping with the dog's family, cat's family? The dog has also family. So to remain in the dog's family, it is very prestigious position? We have now constructed our own family, Kṛṣṇa family. We are entering there. What is the use of remaining in the dog's family, cat's family?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "But if you're actually followers of God, then why are you breaking up the families? Shouldn't you have love for everyone?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because they say that the Ten Commandments says... One of the Ten Commandments, the fourth one, says "Thou shalt honor thy mother and thy father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we honor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But that means by birth, the mother and father also. That's what it refers to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they say, "By your teaching they are spitting on their mothers and fathers."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not spitting. Who is spitting? Everyone... Just like you have got a father and mother. You are not spitting. Whenever father, mother, comes, he honors. That is your version, but his version is different. He loves his father and mother. He teaches him Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> My mother testified to that, that when I was at home I was impossible to live with, and when they saw me afterwards, I was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many. The Hayagrīva's father, mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> My parents think like that too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I could have no relation with them before, but now that I am a devotee, I actually want to help them, so the relationship...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there are so many fathers, mothers; they very much appreciate. And the... Our... None of our disciple is disrespectful to father and mother. Why? I never said that "You become disrespectful to your father and mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The only time there's any argument is if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if the father is demon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The devotees sometimes are disrespectful out of immaturity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a individual fact. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they cannot condemn the movement because of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We never said that "You be..." I never said. And when Brahmānanda was initiated, his mother was standing. I asked Brahmānanda, "Take the dust of your mother's feet first. Then you offer me obeisances." Ask Brahmānanda. So he first of all offered his obeisances to his mother. I told him like that, "You have got good mother." I told him like that, "Otherwise how she has got a son like you?" I always say like that. I never said, "Disrespect." But in particular case, if the father and mother is demon, he must give up their... It is not our business to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The whole controversy centers around this point of breaking up the family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We never said. Breaking up the family... So many ways they are breaking up, the hippies are also breaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The fathers and mothers are also breaking. Divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Father and mother, yes. Why they divorce?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Seven out of ten marriages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within two weeks, three divorce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's a very good point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have no family unit to speak of, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is surprising. If one gentleman lives for life as husband and wife, it is a very surprising thing in your country that they have lived so long as husband and wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, they become very glorified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They put them in the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so credible. So this is your nation, that if one gentleman and lady remain as husband-wife for long time, it is a wonderful thing. So first of all decide what do you mean by religion; what is the definition of religion. Our definition of religion is this, that the law given by God is religion. Now you refute it. That is everywhere. Just like any state, you... The law given by government is law. That is universal truth. You cannot manufacture law at your home. What is given by your state, that is law. Similarly, religion means what is given by God, that is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they say we are making up our own religion because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot make own religion. Then it is not religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is what they accuse us of. They say that we teach our devotees that you can lie for Kṛṣṇa, you can steal for Kṛṣṇa, you can even kill for Kṛṣṇa. So this is immoral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But do you say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, they are distorting. But that is their ar... And just like they use your <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> article about Arjuna on the battlefield, that sometimes we may even have to kill our relatives for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, suppose if God said that "You kill," what you will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Our argument is just that, that in the Bible, God told Abraham, "You must kill your son Isaac." This is a famous story in the Bible. So Abraham took his son and was ready to chop off his head. And God felt sorry and He stopped him. But that story is there in the Bible, that God told Abraham to kill his son, and Abraham was ready to do it. It does not mean that the Jewish religion is based on killing your son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It was a test of his faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It was a test of his faith. The same story of Arjuna, he had to kill for Kṛṣṇa. It's actually a good argument when they say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got sugar candy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't think she packed any. Oh, sugar? She must have packed it. I'll have to find Pālikā, 'cause she has everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They think that if our devotees are willing to do whatever you say, it must mean that they are brainwashed. They have given up their independence, so therefore they are brainwashed. If they are willing to follow anyone blindly, like a slave...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your instruction also. Jehovah says that you shall not worship any other God. So, Jesus Christ says also that you shall not worship. So that is the way of preaching. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That is also required in the military.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That also has been described by Professor Stillson? "Charismastic"? What is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Charismatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charismatic spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think whatever was there was either packed in the basket or the cooker, and there was no sugar. So, I'll have to... If you want, I can have one of these men go and find some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sugar? Where you'll find?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But the... Pradyumna has some sweet mango.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Mango candy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mango candy? (Hari-śauri opens door and asks in another compartment)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pradyumna, have you got some mango candy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There are grapes also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grape candy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No. Fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So, actually, their arguments are not very... So therefore it is simply a plan of Kṛṣṇa to help give us some prominence, make us more well known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Give us a chance to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because their arguments have no substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Defeat them. "God cannot came as fish." "Why? What kind of God He is? He likes, He can do. That is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When I heard the tape of this priest, this minister, and he was trying to cut down our religion, our movement, he was saying that "You believe that God came as a fish, as a tortoise, as a half lion, half man," it reminded me that whenever in the scriptures demons try to blaspheme-like Hiraṇyakṣa-tries to blaspheme against Lord Viṣṇu, Viśvanātha Cakravartī turns it around and makes it seem as if he's actually glorifying Him. You can't blaspheme Kṛṣṇa because whatever you say about Him is simply another glorification. They try to criticize, "Your God had sixteen thousand wives." Actually that's something wonderful. They just take it in the wrong way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (in background) Is Pālikā in there? Listen, Prabhupāda wants some... Have you got any of that mango candy? Can you cut some fruit for Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They're helping us to spread Kṛṣṇa's glories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now, they say... Just like in Los Angeles we have sued the family for two million dollars, two and a half million dollars, because they kidnapped their girl. So they say that the girl, she would not have done this, but because we told her to do it, therefore she did it. Therefore there is control. We are controlling her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must because you checked her freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why did you kidnap? Therefore we must teach him some lesson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Everyone acts in such a way to please his friends, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Their argument is that this girl who was kidnapped, she still likes her family, but now we have told her, "You must sue them." So therefore she is doing it. So therefore she is not free. She is... We are controlling her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now you want to control her. We are controlling, but you want to control her. So if you can control, why shall I not control? Why you are poking your nose? We shall cut your nose. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's what we're going to do too. (Hari-śauri returns with candy)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think we've used up all their arguments. They say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, our challenge is "What is your definition of God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They will answer, "Let us first discuss the definition of brainwashing. Do not talk of God. We are not trying to talk of God. We want to talk about brainwashing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So first of all you define.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Brainwashing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that brainwashing means that when you deprive a person of sleep, of food, you isolate him from the rest of the world, you have him chant something over and over again many times, in this way you can get control of his mind, and then whatever you want, he will do, just like a robot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You first of all said that we are depriving with food. Where is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is their argument...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their argument...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...that we only let them eat twice a day, and even then, not only is there no meat, but there is very little protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on him. If he likes to eat that kind of food, you have no right to enforce upon him. Then you are going to enforce upon him. There are different persons; they like different types of food. And food must be according to his own taste. <span class="Italic">Aguru ohikhanna.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Only twice a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he likes twice a day, why you give thrice? That is his choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And sleeping only four, five hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This makes his mind very weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You rascal, you have nothing to do. You sleep. Napoleon used to sleep for one hour, two hour. He was such a busy man. So they are so busy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they have no time to sleep. Every great man does not sleep very much. The lazy men... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> Sleeping is simply waste of time. So this is... If he does not sleep more, it is a sign of greatness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they have got these crazy fools in the name of psychologists. And these psychologists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our psychologists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These psychologists say that if there is a lack of sleep, then the mind becomes very susceptible to another person's ideas. You can get control of him by depriving him of sleep. Just like they say... There was a war once in the country of Korea between America and China, and the prisoners, the Americans, were captured and put into these prison camps, and the Chinese tried to convert them to Communism by lack of sleep and lack of food, torture. In this way, they say, this is widely accepted that if a person has too little sleep or too little food, then you can break his will and change his life by force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is all right. Then you break. Now he's quite fit for your conversion. He's now weak. You convert him to your ideas. (laughter) We have made the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's what they want! They want us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you kidnap? You say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They want us to give the devotees to them, and then they will deprive them of food and sleep and deprogram him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But we're already depriving him of food and sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are open to everyone. Why do you kidnap? Why do you steal like a thief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> For his own good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are thief. Then thief can also say like that, "For my good I can steal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "It is the lesser of evils."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But God does not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When a person first comes to us he's coming voluntarily and he's not... At that stage he's not deprived of sleep, he's not deprived of eating. But still, he's coming, voluntarily. But when they take him away they have to take him by force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To change him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say to break him of the spell. We have got a spell on him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why he again comes back? You could not break.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes they cannot break, because we have planted our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In most cases they come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. I would say four out of five come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We have given him knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a prison house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say, "You cannot deprogram a Christian because Christianity is real. Therefore this is the proof that Hare Kṛṣṇa is false."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That there is no record of any Christian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We were all Christians, and we changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's a record of a Christian deprogrammed, Peter himself. Christ prophesied that "Before the cock crows you'll deny me three times," and he did. He was deprogrammed just by his association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That was Peter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. (train going again)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> His own... One of his twelve apostles put him on the cross, Judas Iscariat. He was one of the original twelve. He betrayed Jesus for some money and put him on the cross, killed him. He killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. This is the history of your religion. You kill Jesus Christ; you deprive him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's still that point that when a person comes, he's coming voluntarily. We have no chance to deprive him of sleep or food, because he's living outside. He's not living inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that when a man comes to join us, immediately we take away all his money and all his possessions, so in this way we are depriving him of his property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is individual surrender. We have not rendered that way. He surrendered individually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When Christ preached, he told them to "Give up your work; give up your family; give up everything. Don't try to earn a livelihood. Don't worry about where your food will come from. Don't worry where your cloth will come from." He said that in his instructions to his disciples. I think it's in the Acts according to St. Matthew.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> His disciples simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He gave the example that "The birds, they do not try to make a living, but God is feeding them. So do you not think God will help feed if you go out and do His work?" That is what he said to them. (indistinct) And they say they are Christians, but actually the real Christianity is what we are practicing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And also Dr. Harvey Cox of Harvard, he quoted one section of the Bible where Jesus was preaching and his mother did not like it, and his father, and they came to get him away. They thought he was gone crazy, that he was preaching so much about God. So they came to his place where he had gathered many people. They wanted to deprogram him. And Jesus said, "You're not my mother. You're not my father. My real father is in heaven, and my real relatives are those who believe in God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's right in the Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Because there are many fanatics. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Through America it's full of persecutors.(?) These people are very, very hateful towards our men. Europe is all right. Europe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Europe? Germany...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Germany is bad.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> North America would be... South America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, if you did come to America, the best idea is if you went to a farm like the New York farm and just made that your headquarters. And the devotees could visit. They could come and see you. Otherwise, the country in Pennsylvania is very beautiful in the spring and the summer, very peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> New Vrindaban you could go when the palace is done.</div>
