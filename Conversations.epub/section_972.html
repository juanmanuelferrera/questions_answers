<div class="Purp-para">How many copies you have printed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Twenty-five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Already on sales? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, these are the first few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">accha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's a preface by a very famous professor. He has spoken very, very highly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read. What does it say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> (translating) (sic:) "The classical induries(?) based on sacred scriptures from which the eighteen great <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> has a central place. These vast poems, their character give theologic teaching is giving all the knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> and in the substance of the <span class="Italic">Purāṇa</span> there is the face of the Indian populations. While reciting them in the temples and the preacher are giving commentaries in the assembly of devotees, which is called <span class="Italic">sankīrtana.</span> This teaching read to the chant and dancing on the glories of the Lord Bhagavān. Amongst all these <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> the most famous is the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-Purāṇa,</span> called <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> because this literary form is achieved the most beautiful, and also because it's the poem which is expressing the best the doctrine of the faith that Sri Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, Purusottama, the principle of everything, the absolute unique without second, <span class="Italic">advaitam-brahman.</span> Like in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the Lord reveals His majesty in plain. Much more than an <span class="Italic">avatara</span> of Visnu, He appears in our eyes like the unique God. Towards Him all devotion is due. The French people are honored to have, from the beginning of the nineteenth century, to have the first edition of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-Purāṇa,</span> but from long time already this work of the great Beurnuf"-that's the man who translated <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in nineteenth century in French-"is the reason why we have to thank very much the association, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, to give us that very big text, one of the master book of the humanity. This book is very benefic, and with the translation of the Sanskrit there is a commentary, the majestical commentary, which is given verse after verse by the master, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, founder of the association. As he did it with the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which was published in French in 1975 with the preface of a Professor Harvi Delacombe, Swami Prabhupāda explains word by word each <span class="Italic">mantra</span> -stanza or sacred text-before to give a signification. Then the reader can judge every pieces, what is the meaning of the teaching of the master by confrontation with the text itself..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> "And there is also an index and some notes which are giving the work much more easy for the reader, even the profound. This teaching took its root in the teaching of Caitanya Mahaprabhu, that prophet of Kṛṣṇa's. His preaching in Bengal in Orissa in sixteenth century is again appear deeper for the devotion to Bhagavān. Srila Prabhupāda is descending in the disciplic succession, direct <span class="Italic">vamsa,</span> from Caitanya Mahaprabhu and His first disciples, the famous Gosvāmīs. It is a considerable advantage for the French public to have these volumes where there is a vitality manifested from one of these past <span class="Italic">pantha,</span> which are the most followed by the followers of the Hinduism. We hope that there is a large distribution of this tradition and commentary of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-Purāṇa.</span> Anyone who is interested in the life of India can find the authentic teaching, spiritual teaching authorized, and can also have access to one of the most beautiful religious poem from the Hindu tradition." This is the.... It's wonderful.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> (translating) "The <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is most known under the name of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-Purāṇa.</span> The Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">Purāṇa</span> means 'ancient, old work.' It is a commentary on the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> by Vyasadeva, its author, from which we also learn about the <span class="Italic">Mahabharata.</span> From a general way, but particularly the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> the <span class="Italic">Purāṇa</span> is a true encyclopedia containing all the aspects of the life of spirit. We have to see that this great work is containing all the predictions, this, of realizing in every detail. Then it is very important to point out that the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> under its poetic form is a very actual by the subject which it's treating about. The truth is one and universal, and the tradition of this work is always valuable. The <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is an essential development of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It's talking about the questions metaphysical, philosophical, religious, psychologic, political and social. The wonderful tradition of Swami Prabhupāda is inspired from the same principles that the one who guided him in his translation of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Every Sanskrit verse is written in Latin characters and then a literary version. The commentary, which is referring always from the <span class="Italic">Veda, Upaniṣad,</span> and other texts, is allowing the reader to make spiritual progress. The <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is a precious work and will be revealed for a lot of people from the Western. And there is a very urgent need to spread this message throughout the world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Ah! It's a very good decision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Doctor of letters.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Every book comes with these bookmarks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, bookmark. So, it is another step forward. (laughs) <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no obstruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No. (laughs) They are very determined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In France the atmosphere is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why your cloth is so dirty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> I just traveled with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> it is very nice. So people may not dislike it, but for a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> this is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He's doing very nicely, Pṛthu-putra. He's having many preaching engagements.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You doing a color scheme on the different color for each canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Maybe not, maybe keep the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be three parts or two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Two parts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give Bhagavān <span class="Italic">prabhu</span> nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Our, the devotees only eat <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> My <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> was sitting here. I'm sorry to hear that you are so sick. You are sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Should have, cough, to stop.(?) The coughing is continuing and practically no appetite, and palpitation of heart. Going up the step is.... So how under this condition I can travel? It is not...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He wanted to give you five. He gave us five different prescriptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not take anything, tablet. Rather, what one I was taking, I have stopped that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You do not put very much faith in these doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What this medicine will help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of the medicine he gave was to dull your senses so much that you wouldn't feel any pain, or would make you sleep for six hours at a time or, like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in the village how many devotees are there?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have very well managed. And everyone is eating very nicely. (laughter) Similarly in New Vrindaban. What is the.... I want this, that you have sufficient grain, sufficient milk, then where is your economic question? And from milk, by intelligence you can get so many preparation-<span class="Italic">luci, puri, halava, rasagulla, sandesh, rabri,</span> wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There is one boy, one of our <span class="Italic">sankīrtana</span> devotees, who previously was a farmer. His father has given him a farm in the north of France. So recently he has given us his whole crop of hay for the cows. The value of that was thirty thousand dollars. It's enough hay to supply twenty-five or thirty cows for two years, and on top of that he's able to get a loan from the bank of forty-five thousand dollars for twenty years at four percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To be repaid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. But this he can use to purchase cows and build barn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only four percent. How their bank is giving so cheap?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Because he's a farmer. They're helping...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, farmers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Special concession for farmers to help farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means government encouraging farming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Because no one wants to farm anymore these days. I heard that, especially in France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> Yes, especially in France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have also paid our loan to Los Angeles. One month ago I paid seventeen thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you, you can take back loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I was holding it for him, but then he said he didn't need it right away, so I sent it to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We hadn't determined what building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have.... That building you should purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, now I'll get the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got twenty thousand, and he has already paid seventeen thousand, so I think you can collect fifty thousand immediately. If you want, I can give you also four, five thousand, not less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, that money in the Lloyd's Bank account? Yes, we will give you better interest than the bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good. No, now we are book selling nicely. I think our settlement.... (?) Kṛṣṇa has arranged everything cautiously and not extravagantly. You go on. Everything will be all right. There will be no scarcity. <span class="Italic">Yāvad-artha-prayojanam.</span> Our parents taught us, mother, if there was a grain of rice on the ground and it is touched with feet, "Oh, you take it." We were taught like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Nothing should be wasted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa has sent you His grain. You cannot waste it. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Live that way. And Kṛṣṇa is providing so much facilities for becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, and why should we deviate and spoil this life, take the risk of again going into the cycle of birth and death? Commonsense affair. We have got the good, greatest opportunity to solve this problem of repetition of birth. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> And only for little sense gratification we are going to sacrifice so great opportunity of life?

<div class="Purp-para">"When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think that it is not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification, by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another." Purport? "Begging, borrowing and stealing to live for sense gratification is condemned in this verse because such consciousness leads one to a dark, hellish condition. The four sinful activities are illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. These are the means by which one gets another material body that is full of miseries."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know. When you can say, they'll think, "What these people are talking?" They are so dull-brained. They cannot understand anything. We are taking it, immediately accepted. It is so serious. And you, on the general public, if you speak? "All nonsense they are speaking." Dull brain. By eating meat and intoxication they have lost their all human brain tissues. Such a condition. Still, some professors receiving and doing some applause. That is. Otherwise who is understanding? The brain is so dull in the modern world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's called a vicious cycle. Because the brain is so dull, therefore they can't understand how to stop performing these activities; and because they don't stop performing these activities, therefore the brain remains dull. In this way they are caught up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">pramattaḥ,</span> that we can see, <span class="Italic">pramattaḥ,</span> mad. And everyone, especially in the Western country, so many madmen. The hippies, their whole sect-mad. <span class="Italic">Pramattaḥ.</span> Then so-called businessmen, so-called scientist, so-called philosopher-everyone is mad. And <span class="Italic">kurute vikarma,</span> all sinful activities, especially the slaughterhouse, horrible. Everyone is taking share of these sinful activities. They're fighting amongst themselves, this party, that party, communist party, fascist party, then barking in the United Nation and so on, so on. All mad. At least we must know it. Or we are talking nonsense; they are all right. What is your conviction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We are seeing that more and more we are having to preach to younger and younger people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are innocent.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spoiled, all spoiled. All spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Now many devotees are younger, sixteen, seventeen years old, not so spoiled.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, I read part of it. I'll go on.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Set up a drought committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In France there was a big drought, terrible drought. Many animals died. So the president of the country made a speech, and all he could say in his speech was that people should try to use less water. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. There was another caricature, India. So there was some drought, the same. So there was some, what is called, representation: "And there is no water. We are suffering. This is the difficulty." "Yes, we are taking step, but next week you'll have television." Advancement, television. Because there was no television, so this is the advancement. Next week they have television. As if television will solve the problem. All <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> rascals, are very horrible condition. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is no other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Tāmala Kṛṣṇa once published an article in the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> The title was "You Cannot Eat Nuts and Bolts."</div>

And how long you'll go on? The animals will.... And no more animals die? Then what they'll do? Animal, after all, they live on grains and grass, but one set or two set or three set you can kill and eat. The next...? Then you have to eat dry grass. It is a wrong civilization. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina.</span> There is no water. They are flying to the Mars planet. What is the Mars planet news? Any news?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but still, I am saying, "This will be all failure." And still, they are hopeful. My Guru Maharaja is very pleased. As soon as a book comes out, he is pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Especially one so beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was lamenting that "These men, they did not make, publish any number of books. They are simply after this stone and bricks." He condemned. He was very, very sorry. So I thought that I must take a risk. And he's pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So now you have books and temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, temple is automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Without fighting, you've got so many temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I never stressed on temple. I was engaged in publishing the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> Whatever I could do, I did it because I took it very seriously that he is very sorry that these things were not done. He said that "There will be fire in this Gaudiya Math." <span class="Italic">Āgun jvālbe,</span> he said. <span class="Italic">Amari taci loka kichui boi kakrayebo</span> (?): "If I can, I shall sell these marbles of this temple and convert them into books."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But then as soon as Prabhupāda does any activity, he immediately becomes exhausted, just to go downstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday evening I was thinking, "Now I am feeling all right. Tomorrow I shall go for morning walk," like that. (laughs) That is due to my practice. So the palace is prepared now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> First class. I think your quarters are the best. Very confortable. Your bathroom is all redone. You have a nice separate bedroom, separate bathroom, and a very nice, almost this big. It is very sunny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sunny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Very sunny. All day long the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is alluring. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, Bhagavān is trying to allure you, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And we are having Deity installation also. The Kṛṣṇa-Balarama Deity is there. They're very beautiful, extremely. And we have a new Vyāsāsana. I had it made in Italy with all marble, temple. Anyway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You can send him pictures in India. I was going to ask you, Srila Prabhupāda. If I wanted to install Gaura-Nitai Deities also, like the ones in Baltimore and this farm, here also, along with the Radha-Kṛṣṇa Deities, without two altars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. Whether or not that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The devotees very much like to worship Gaura-Nitai along with Radha-Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You are wanting sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No stairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No stairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, stairs, I may not come down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's the problem. Once he's up, he can't come down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That means he can't go outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I.... Come down is not so very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have already a palanquin to carry you up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> We have elevator also, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, we have elevator there also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is it working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Well, it's being fixed right now, but if I.... But we have a palanquin to carry up the stairs. It's actually warm there, very warm during the day, and your room is extremely warm because the sun crosses it all day long, and there won't be anybody to bother you. All the devotees are out of the castle. They're all in little houses all around. And it's so big that you won't feel cramped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I shall feel hungry also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Hungry? No, you ate good there last year. You ate very well there last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I like it. It is very nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> The air is good too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> The air, the atmosphere, is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I don't know. I was thinking the trip.... We have that big Mercedes limousine. You rode in it last year. It was very comfortable, and the ride, I don't think you found it so difficult, did you? Last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> This year, by the time he got to Bury Place, he was completely exhausted, Bhagavān. Half an hour's drive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That due to the staircase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> But by the time you sat on the Vyasasana there you were already looking very tired, what to speak of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Paris has elevator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paris, I know, that I have told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> (laughs) He told me that when we got to the top of the stairs in Bury Place. He said, "In Paris there is a lift."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In all respects Paris is superior. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I was just thinking that if you wanted warm weather, it's very warm during the day, and the air is very clean. It's not so dusty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the village there must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The trouble is if you get sick along the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> On the way back from the airport we had to stop twice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Anyway, that trip to India is also long, eight hours. It's also long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Thing is Prabhupāda is thinking that if he has to go to India anyway, so he may as well go straight there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The thing is you may be bothered in India. There are so many people who come, even though you say no. Even though you say no, there's always people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the present problem is that I cannot go out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So that we have.... We have nice palanquin. Remember when you came two years ago, we had a palanquin and we carried you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> In this engagement, in the Philosophical (?) Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You spoke at one society, and we carried you up a long stair in a very comfortable palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In Paris. You gave an engagement at the top of a very big building, and there was no lift, so we built a palanquin and we carried you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That library, something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The other thing is, though, that if you go to Paris, then it means you have to go up the steps to get into the airplane, not just in Paris.... At least in London you have to, and then again you have to do it in Paris, and then again you'll have to do it in Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, but he doesn't have to.... He can stay there for a while. He doesn't have to go to Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, you can't fly direct to India from Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He has to stop somewhere along the way. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We're hoping he'll rapidly recover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, Srila Prabhupāda is not expecting it at this point. Of course, we're all praying for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I said we're all praying for your rapid recovery, but whether or not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you did not come yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I was putting together your <span class="Italic">Vyasasana.</span> (laughs) All night long I stayed up. Also our printer from Italy, he is wanting to present you with the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book. He has had his men working seven days a week, composing. They are composing. It is going to be a very nice book. We had one article in the paper. We went to a book fair, and thousands of publishers.... So the article they wrote on us was that "The association for Kṛṣṇa consciousness produces luxurious books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Our Kṛṣṇa is most luxurious person. He is never poverty-stricken. Always with <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> cowherd boys, killing all demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Harikeśa Maharaja and I were discussing last night about your travel plans, and we were debating on what was actually the best place for you to go. So someone was saying Tehran, someone was saying Paris farm, like this, but the point that came out was that as far as health is concerned, India is not the best place for you to go at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Not the best place. However, the main point is that you want to go there. That was what was felt by the devotees who were discussing, that you want to go to India immediately and that you will feel more comfortable by going to India immediately. That was what was being discussed. Although for health purposes that may not actually be the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> For us India is not very healthy. But for Prabhupāda it's the best place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I said for us India is not so healthy, but for yourself it's the best place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Prabhupāda also got sick in India. Remember? Two years ago in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Exactly this time, two years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Anyway, I think the stair problem is not such a big problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, that is not an insurmountable problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There are three hundred devotees who want to carry you. But I mean there you will not have people coming if you want to rest. There are no.... There are only planned people who would come. But there won't be hundreds of Indians coming to see you. And you have.... Right next to your quarters there's your own private kitchen also, so everything's very close at hand. All your servants quarters are.... That whole floor is.... Actually the whole castle is empty, so there's no noise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It may be very nice for you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Your quarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall go immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think that, Srila Prabhupāda, you should not feel obliged in any way to go. Only whatever you think is best for your health condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, obliged, I am always obliged to you. That's a fact. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We are only obliged to you. That's a fact. That is the actual fact. It must be decided, though, what you think is best for your health situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Prabhupāda, the only thing I'm just a little concerned is just if you have difficulty in the car. But if that won't be too difficult, I really think that this is ideal. Your quarters are really first class, extremely wonderful. And the only other thing is at night it's cool, but that's not so bad either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at night cool will be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And in the morning it is warm at ten o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So kitchen is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. You have a cook here? Your temple was cooking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, Arundhatī is cooking. I think Palika should come? Palika should not come for cooking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Should she not come? She wants to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There are so many cooks. Malati is there, and we have.... You've never had problem with cooking in France before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Harikeśa can cook also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We all think, though, that whenever you are feeling sick and you go to India, there's always so many people who see you anyway. I remember when you were sick in Vṛndāvana and Brahmananda and I were there. Even though you were sick, at least fifteen people saw you every day, coming in and out constantly, and then you had to sit up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Actually all of us agreed yesterday when we were discussing it that as far as health purposes is concerned, we do not think it is a good idea for you to go to India immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We argued for a half hour against going to India, but in the end, you decided that you wanted to go to Bombay immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But I mean, if you have to risk that eight-hour plane ride, that's much more difficult than going to the farm. The farm is only three hours in a comfortable car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not just that. It's the problem that you have to fly from France to somewhere else and then from somewhere else back to India. I said the main problem is that if you do go to France, then it means a great deal more traveling than would be involved in simply flying to India, because you'd have to travel back and forth to the Paris farm. Then you would also have to stay in Tehran, up and down like that in the plane, and then again fly to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> But he doesn't have to stay in the farm for just nine days. He can stay there for long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the health suits, I can stay there. If the health improves, I can stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> Air India is direct from Geneva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall not stay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> I came back from Bombay to Geneva by direct plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> I didn't have to stop in Tehran, and Geneva is very near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I think you can recover there. The atmosphere is so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> From the farm Geneva is the same distance than to Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I mean, more or less whenever you get sick everyone thinks that India is not really the best place, because you're always obliged to so many people. Whether you are feeling like it or not, they always come in the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And they are generally.... I know this, that these.... I like Indian people, but these Indian people are not very conscious of your position. They think that you're just another guru. Many of them do. Of course, some of them appreciate you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian mentality is that "If we see one saintly person and offer obeisances, we get some blessing for our material..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're very selfish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In this way, I don't think they really appreciate your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āśīrvāda, āśīrvāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Last night, one man came with his family. They wanted to have your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> I said, "Prabhupāda is in bed. He's resting." He was insisting, he said, "I do not want to hear him speak, I simply want to see him." I said, "He's in bed. You can't go into his bedroom. How is it possible?" "No, that is all right. I will just go in, and I will see him." (laughter) I said, "What is this? Get out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I remember when we left Bombay, you'd been giving <span class="Italic">darśana</span> for four and a half hours on the roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the water there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes, we have our own water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Creek water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Underground. It's very nice. Very tasty and light. It's not heavy water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's a fact that on the whole, this farm is a wonderful place. I was there a couple of times. I very much liked it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spring water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, let us go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> As soon as we can book a flight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We can arrange things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Bhagavān, we should.... Couldn't we somehow arrange it so that Prabhupāda doesn't have to go through the heavy traffic to the airport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We'll have to see what time they're flying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Every hour. All right, so you're sure that this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I want some nice water, digestive. Let us see there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Here the water is not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't say it is not good, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is our own water; it's not city water with so many chemicals in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What about that bottle water, mineral water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He can have that too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> France is the best place for mineral water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In France they have many very nice waters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mineral water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Prabhupāda knows. He used to sell Vichy water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vichy water. But I don't like. Bottled water I don't like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, we have fresh water all the time. And you have hot water in bathroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I knew Bhagavān would come, and this would happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I never thought that you would go to India. I knew that Bhagavān would come and you would go to Paris. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if I improve my health, I shall stay there for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Actually, it's a fact that you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere is my home. Not that India.... If I am attached to India, then how I am <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> And every other day I will give you a new book. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You have to keep it, too, when you promise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So we can plan that. Thank you very much, Srila Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Srila Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Western people, they are not only fool but misbehaved. <span class="Italic">Paścime loka saba mūḍha anārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And the further West you go, the worse they become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, from Bengal you go Western side. They are very filthy. And go more, more, more Western-filthy, filthy, filthy, filthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Pakistan is the worst. Karachi, I heard, is the worst city in the world almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavatam amalam purāṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> These books are exquisite. The books they make in France are just marvelous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It was printed in Italy, I think, but this here is so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, embossed. I think our other books are not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Of course, in France this is very much appreciated because the people are like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fancy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's big competition now between our French and Spanish and English, between our publishing, French, Spanish and English. They are always competing. And the Germans also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think the French are on top though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Their French <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the French one, when it came out, it's so much better than any other version we've had. Every time they bring a new book out, it seems to be an advancement on everything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yogeśvara is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he is very expert, very enthusiastic. His wife is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They included a number of photos also. In the picture sections they've headed each section with a photo. There's one of Vṛndāvana temple. They have a photo of your room in Rādhā-Dāmodara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In one of the sections here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I have to go in and do some more.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Right in here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Through that window you could see Rūpa Gosvāmī's <span class="Italic">samadhi.</span> And for those two rooms they were charging five rupees a month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These rooms were broken. So they told me that "You can repair these, and whatever you like, you can give." So I thought, "Don't need much space." "Pay me if..." I know, before me there was a tenant in that other room. He was paying three rupees. So I thought, "Two rooms, but I have spent money. So I'll give him five." Now I am giving them ten rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To retain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes the devotees go down there and clean out the rooms, and they have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> there sometimes. I think this is the first book that someone included this photo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It was very calm and quiet. And people used to offer obeisances from outside because they knew. Practically everyone knew me. So they used to offer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were very well known in Vṛndāvana before you came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very well known, but people knew me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because you were writing or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Or because of your ambition to come to the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, at that time there was no such thing. I was living there, retired man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So when you went to Vṛndāvana, you'd given up the idea of coming to the West or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, coming to the West, the idea was there, but I was planning how to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, nothing concrete was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that idea was there, but how to go there, how to preach there, how to take some books, how to bring them, everything alone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So as soon as you had some books, then you were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then I decided. Everything was being dictated by superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was told that one day you were told by Rūpa Gosvāmī that you must go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that was open secret. Everyone knew. This antique photo is very dull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where this photo was?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know. (end)</div>
