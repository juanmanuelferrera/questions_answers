<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They boil it with.... Oh, you have come. Good morning. Thank you. With rice. I forgot your name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Keśavalāl Trivedi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trivedi, Mr. Trivedi, yes. So, who is independent? This is our question. Who is independent? Do you know any man who is independent or any animal or any...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they are thinking independently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Unless we have got the identity, correct identity, we cannot be independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> This is keys for the lock, Prabhupāda. It fell down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think somebody has left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Yes, there is lock and chain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> This way, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way? This is natural lake or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. It never dries up. It stays full all year round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gigantic. Like the Hyderabad lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> It looks bigger than the Hyderabad lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] So if you are not independent, what is the value of your thinking independently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Absolutely none. None.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But everyone is thinking independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that which is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are making plans, theories, "ism." What is the value of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Absolutely none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore everything is becoming failure. So preach this truth to the world, that "You are all rascals. Why you are thinking independently?" Huh? "Why I am rascal?" "Because you are thinking independently. That is the proof that you are a rascal." <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. Īśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhaḥ.</span> And they are thinking independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> <span class="Italic">Baddha</span> we have got, and still we are thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Baddha-jīva,</span> every moment he is under the strict laws of nature. Generally they think that.... They speak also. "I think." Do they not say? "I think," as if he is independently thinking. What you can think? Hm? Acyutānanda Mahārāja, why do they say, "I think," "In my opinion"? What is the value of your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, I have a certain amount of experience, and with my intelligence and my mind and my scientific method, I can put all that together and come out with some practical solution which I can work on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you cannot, because you are not independent. <span class="Italic">Uru-damni baddhaḥ.</span> If you are tied hands and legs with strong rope, how you can think of "I shall become free in this way. I shall become free...?" But your hands and legs are tied up, so why do you think foolishly that you shall become free in this way, you shall become free this way? First of all open this, the tightening knot; then you plan that "I shall become..." But there is no such chance. So what is the value of your thinking like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, relatively speaking, it's better to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. Because you are so rascal, you do not know that "I cannot move even an inch and I am making plan." That is the proof that you are a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> <span class="Italic">Tena vina tṛṇam api na calati.</span> That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But why are people in the capital...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we call them all rascals. That is our confirmation of our statement. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas,</span> you all rascals, without any exception. Hm? The other day the high-court judge, he's supposed to be the most intelligent person within this state, high-court judge, and he was talking so many nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Because he thinks he knows, he does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> One who thinks he knows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Manyamāna, manyamāna.</span> He is thinking he is very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> While he was saying that, I was thinking, "I hope I never have him for a judge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll find everywhere such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Ultimately he was saying, "It is not Kṛṣṇa or this. It is some 'something.' That is the reality."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> He was thinking that he was bringing about some synthesization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> And that he was bringing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...with this land also? No. [break] ...this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> I think it is a school, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] He does not know. He does not say that "certainly school." "It may be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, if I'm convinced it's a school, it's a school. I mean, the only thing that really matters is my perception of that thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You learn from him that it is school. Before that, you did not know. Therefore you have to learn. That experience is valuable, when you learn it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but the only thing that makes it a school...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot imagine by seeing a building that it is a school. You cannot imagine that. That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But all the people inside, they are also imagining that it's a school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Just like if there is a pen. If I use it to kill someone, it is a weapon. If I use it to mix something, it is an instrument. If I use it to write with, then it's a pen. So it is not a pen. It is not a weapon. It is my idea that I impose on the object that makes it what it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. Your idea, that is foolishness. But you learn from a teacher that this is pen; this is not a weapon. You have to learn it. If you don't learn it, then you will go on making experiment whether it is pen or it is weapon or it is this or that. Go on. But it will never come to any conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> Like giving a child a pen who does not know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> ...that we have to write with it. He has to be taught that we have to write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere you have to learn from the perfect person. Then his knowledge is perfect. So our proposition is that: learn from Kṛṣṇa and you get perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> That is why he is <span class="Italic">jagat guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We've invented this pen, so we can invent how to use the pen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not invented. Some experienced more than yourself, he has done. You have been given the pen to use it for that purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. Whenever some scientist does something, the whole nation of that scientist takes the credit. That is another idea. They say, "We made the pen," or something. Everyone in India takes the credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is animalism. <span class="Italic">Dehātmā-buddhiḥ.</span> "I belong to some particular body, and he belongs to the same body or same nation. Therefore we become..." Instead of "I," we become "we."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Recently there was an atomic scientist whose all major education was in America and Europe, and he won a Nobel Prize award...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the tendency everywhere. The Britishers.... You go to the Parliament and Westminster Abbey. They have kept all the statues of Sir Isaac Newton and this Churchill, this.... Mean, they want to show that "It is only our nation who has produced all these intelligent persons."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Yes, yes. From "I-ness" to "we-ness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] This is basis of <span class="Italic">Gītā. Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> Learn from the real person, <span class="Italic">tattva-darśinaḥ,</span> who has seen, who has actual experience of the truth. Learn from him. The <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> never recommends that you imagine and make your theories. Never said. That is the Vedic culture. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsur śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the way. Take lesson from Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative. Then you will get experience. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What is the use of imagining?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, after all, all this talk about God was simply there because of man's desire to explain the unknown. He saw a thunderbolt and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is unknown to the rascal man. It is known to the sober man. (laughter) He should become sober instead of becoming a rascal. That is required. <span class="Italic">Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda:</span> "He knows, who has accepted the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>" This is Theosophical Society, I think. Huh? That trademark. Or Rāmakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, Salvation Army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salvation Army, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> This is also school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually we're the only Salvation Army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] ...the authority of a authority. We're accepting his authority, but his experience comes from his direct perception, which comes back to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't take such authorities, who takes experience from others. We take authority who is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Automatically. (sic:) <span class="Italic">Parāsya bhaktir vividhaiva śruyate svabhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca. Svabhāva...,</span> you can.... Just like if you ask me how to do something, if I say, "Yes, you do like this," <span class="Italic">svabhāvikī.</span> I have got by nature knowledge how to do it perfectly. That is going on. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> Kṛṣṇa is dictating that "You do like this." So, you see, everything is coming perfect. From the <span class="Italic">nim</span> seed a <span class="Italic">nim</span> tree will come. It is so nicely made by Kṛṣṇa-<span class="Italic">bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]-that it will come <span class="Italic">nim</span> tree, not mango tree. The chemicals are so combined. You do not know what is there, a small seed, <span class="Italic">baṭa vṛkṣa.</span> And a huge banyan tree will come out, not other tree. That is knowledge. He has given the whole, I mean to say, operation in a small seed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām.</span> There is no mistake. You simply take it and cultivate. You'll get the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So that principle, which makes things grow, the <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says, <span class="Italic">so 'ham asmi:</span> "I am that principle."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says in the ultimate <span class="Italic">śloka, so 'ham asmi:</span> "I am that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Asmi</span> means "It is my energy. It is my energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, it says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I say that "I am ISKCON," what is the wrong there? Because I have created this; therefore I say, "ISKCON means I. I am ISKCON." So what is the wrong there? It is like that. By energy of Kṛṣṇa, everything has come out. Therefore says, "I am this, I am this, I am this, I am this." <span class="Italic">Vibhūti-bhinnam.</span> Because everything.... <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Everything has come from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, the <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says that you are that principle. <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says the principle which is lighting the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, a devotee accepts.... That we accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...that "I am that principle. The being that is lighting the sun, I am that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">So 'ham asmi.</span> That sixteenth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Like unto the sun, as am I."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes, <span class="Italic">so 'ham asmi</span>-because I am part and parcel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, but it says "I am that, " not that "I am part of that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "I am that." "Like unto..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is said, it can be accepted, because I am qualitatively the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Quantity, much difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, but the direct statement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am.... If I say, "I am Indian," what is the wrong there, if I say, "I am Indian"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That is something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But to directly accept the <span class="Italic">śruti,</span> it says you are that same principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore you have to learn from the <span class="Italic">guru.</span> And if you directly take, then you remain a fool. Therefore you require a guru. That is the instruction of <span class="Italic">śruti. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to learn <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> You have to come to a guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, but this is after that. The ultimate conclusion of that <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad, śruti,</span> the authority, is that you are that same principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am the same principle. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, nothing can be more eternal than another eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It is contradictory then. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityanānāṁ.</span> You cannot say that one thing is more eternal than another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not the point. Everyone is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So how can one be more eternal than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As God is eternal, so you are also eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then why the distinction...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because you have accepted this material body, you are foolishly thinking that you are not eternal. Otherwise, as God is eternal, you are also eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then why should one be distinguished from another if they are both eternal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sun distinguished from the sunshine, but qualitatively heat and light is there. But because sunshine is there, you cannot say sun is there. That you cannot say. <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Clearly said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> I think, Swamijī, you explained this, and I could draw rationality from it, that "I am <span class="Italic">īśa,</span> but not I am <span class="Italic">sarveśa.</span> I am <span class="Italic">ātman</span> but not Paramātman."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> "I am <span class="Italic">aṁśa</span> but not <span class="Italic">Paramāṁśa.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained in other.... You have to take reference. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> I am also <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ.</span> That I explained so many times. But that does not mean I am <span class="Italic">paramesvara.</span> <span class="Italic">Paramesvara</span> is Kṛṣṇa. What is this building? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> This is more of that Christian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Same seal as the Christian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> This is a mosque.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi</span> I was not able to explain till I heard Swamijī on the first day at Rajeswara in Mandapur.(?) That fits in. Otherwise Māyāvādīns, "All right, but Śaṅkarācārya saying, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> Why you say no?" Because so many persons ask me question. And when I was confronted, I was not able to say that. But the way the <span class="Italic">mukti</span> was defined, <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> yes, and in the lecture, and <span class="Italic">īṣa, sarveśa,</span> all those things-<span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> Paramātmā, <span class="Italic">aṁśa, Paramāṁśa</span>-there I found that it can be explained. Because so many persons, they ask in public meeting like Lions Club, where we take up these topics. Then we feel at our wit's end. But now I think I can explain them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that day my explanation was all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> Yes, that is how I feel. And that is what will apply also to Acyutānanda Swami's question also, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, I'm just fencing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> No, no, that's all.... I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So Durga is higher than Viṣṇu because Viṣṇu required Durga to awaken Him from the <span class="Italic">yoga-nidrā</span> to kill Madhu and Kaitabha. So she controls Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if I ask my servant that "You ask me to get up at seven o'clock," that does not mean.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Keśavalāl Trivedi:</span> No, some of these things we could not follow. As a matter of <span class="Italic">Madhu-Kaitabha-vadha,</span> I have read it several times.... (end)</div>
