<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One has to practice. It will take some time. [break] <span class="Italic">...yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā.</span> One has to practice. That means his determination is not yet fixed up. Because he is very rich, he is thinking that "This is all right." That is another defect of becoming very much rich. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya prasaktānāṁ tayā upahṛta-cetasām:</span> [Bg. 2.44] "Those who are too much attached to this material enjoyment and..., by which his consciousness is bewildered..." All these defects are there because he is too much attached to material enjoyment. Why don't you give him dress if he has no dress. This is not good. You have not marked it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is this? He's... Give him dress. [break] Give him lesson how to make <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span> He has come to your shelter. You teach him. [break] Just like a diseased person, if he is a little careless, he is not very strict in following the..., it will take some time. It is exactly like that. He, because of his material opulences, he thinks that "Oh, where is the disease? This is all right. I am happy." That is the defect. We have to reduce. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Not that "Because my tongue is asking me to eat something, therefore I must eat." Not that. That is the difference between ordinary man and <span class="Italic">gosvāmī. Gosvāmī</span> means one who has conquered over the dictation of the senses. My sense dictates to do something, but when I am able to dictate the sense, "No, you cannot do it," that is called <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...maybe an African or Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> African, after all. Americans must be first. (static interference) ...politically conscious Africans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got about ten African devotees now in Nairobi branch. [break] ...to material sense enjoyment. Such persons cannot take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...avoid the dictation of the senses. But when a man is able to dictate the senses, then he is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "One who is lord of go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, senses. In that stage he cannot give up. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartante.</span> When one sees that "This is better quality than the other," then he takes. Unless... Because superficially... Suppose because for becoming Vaiṣṇava, he has to undergo so many austerities. So ordinary man cannot find out that this is better life than that. So when he understands, "This service is not good; to serve Kṛṣṇa is good," then he can give up the service of <span class="Italic">māyā. Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartante.</span> Just like an ordinary servant, he is serving in your house, but if he gets some more salary in other's house, he gives it up. That is required. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartante.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading) "This <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or illusory struggle for existence is immediately stopped. Lord Brahmā, who has full control over the Goddess of learning and who is considered to be the best authority in Vedic knowledge, was thus perplexed, being unable to understand the extraordinary power manifested in the Supreme Personality of Godhead." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ. Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ.</span> [break] ...said that unless one comes to understand the inconceivable power of God, there is no meaning of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is inconceivable to conceive God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, inconceivable power of God. God is in your presence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, but His personal power is inconceivable. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...understand the inconceivable power of God. [break] First of all he has to come to the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa. Sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tato rājas-tamo-bhāvāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye<br class="calibre2"/>ceta etair anāvidhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.19]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">When one becomes free from the <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> the symptom is... <span class="Italic">Rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> means lust and greediness. So when this <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> is absent, then the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span> becomes prominent. Every <span class="Italic">guṇa</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Tato rajas-tamo-bhavaḥ kama-lobhadayas ca ye, ceta etaiḥ...</span> The consciousness does not become infected by the resultant action of <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa.</span> Then the only <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span> remains. So when one is situated in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, sthita-sattve prasidati,</span> then he becomes jubilant, <span class="Italic">prasidati.</span> That is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> So one has to overcome the jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span> At the present moment the whole world is covered mostly by <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> and little by <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Americans have more <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa.</span> They are creating and creating and creating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are by more <span class="Italic">tamas.</span> They are indolent, don't want to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Everyone makes this mistake. So as he is accepting, as Arjuna accepted, this is <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> acceptance. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...the material luminaries, Your transcendental effulgence is identical with <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span>" [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...advised and all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> advised, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's advised. Why should we go somewhere else? Take shelter of His lotus feet. That's all. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is right conclusion. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Mahātmā,</span> immediately by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. Immediately. [break] A child, if he is informed, "God is everywhere," he will never understand what is God. He knows that God is there, that this God consciousness is there. So what is the use of educating him, "Oh, God is everywhere. You don't require to go to temple?" This is nonsense. It is <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.</span> He must know, "Here is God." He goes there, offer respect. All the children come. [break] ...a man, military man like Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. Can he be a general?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mr. Sar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Arjuna was a very, very great general, the most ideal general representing the real culture of this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. It doesn't matter. Nanda Mahārāja, a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> Arjuna is a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And there are many <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> also. So what is that goat(?) <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla.</span> He was a <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla.</span> But everyone has got the right to become a devotee. That is wanted. [break] <span class="Italic">...tanuvān manobhiḥ.</span> Remain in your place, but giving aural reception to the Kṛṣṇa message, you become a devotee. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We don't ask anybody to change. We want to make him transcendental. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Brahma-stuta śruti-kārayan.</span> Now, in the <span class="Italic">brahma-stuta, yaṁ brahma,</span> beginning... So that is <span class="Italic">yaṁ brahma.</span> Then simply if you recite, <span class="Italic">yaṁ brahma...</span> You must know who is that <span class="Italic">yam.</span> And that is being explained by Kṛṣṇa. Here is that <span class="Italic">yam,</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Vasudeva, bolo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> (chants some verse in Sanskrit.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Devakī ānandam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇaṁ vande jagat guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yaṁ brahma-varuṇendra-rudraḥ stunvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ.</span> Sometimes the impersonalists argue, "If nobody has seen Him, then where is His form?" But here is. Brahmā, <span class="Italic">yaṁ brahma.</span> Here is Brahmā praying. So why you say nobody has seen? Brahmā has seen. Therefore he is offering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bolo asitagirā samaṁsyāt.</span> He'll recite half a dozen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> (chants Sanskrit verses.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> (chants more verses)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He wants to study Sanskrit from now, when I read all those books. But his father has put him directly in English medium. It becomes very difficult. I have to take him out and now he can read Sanskrit. You can read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> English medium, Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> English medium, the intelligence gets baffled because it is not a mother language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo Ghosh studied English from the very beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he was extremely clever. He studied then Gujarati, not even Bengali. After he came from England...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came to Gujarati. No. He came to Baroda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then he studied Gujarati, but he did not know Bengali at all. And then he came... [break] What is that? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Sanskrit) From our childhood, if there was a rice grain on the floor, my father, er, my mother would ask me, "Take it and touch it on your head."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We were advised not to tread on the grains. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because by chance, if the grain is struck with the leg, she asked, "Take it and you touch it on the head."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the culture. That is real culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means from the very beginning he understands <span class="Italic">anna-brahma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even it is not spoken, you practice it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, practice it. According to Vedic culture, the higher class, in every home there is <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa-śilā</span> for worship, especially of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In our homes we have all these small such temples, small chapels. All of us, our homes have got one room specially for <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-mūrti</span> and (indistinct) For <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> only. [break] We say <span class="Italic">ṭhākura-ghara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ṭhākura-ghara</span> must be there, not only simply a lavatory. There must be one <span class="Italic">ṭhākura-ghara.</span> (end)</div>
