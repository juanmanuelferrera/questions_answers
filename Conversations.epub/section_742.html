<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The rascals should not do that. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, <span class="Italic">nāmāśraya kari thākaha āpana kārye.</span> You do your work but take shelter of <span class="Italic">hari-nama.</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So simple, yes. (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Nāmāśraya kari, thākaha āpana karye.</span> "Go on with your duty, prescribed duty, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I was recently told by one devotee that the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> does not have to be a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> does not have to be a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Well, he said it. Who said it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said? Who is that rascal? The <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> does not require to be a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He said it. Nitāi said it. He said it in this context. He said that Lord Brahm is the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sampradāya,</span> but yet he is sometimes afflicted by passion. So therefore he is saying that it appears that the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> does not have to be a pure devotee. So it does not seem right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is that rascal? I want to know who has said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Nitāi. Nitāi <span class="Italic">dāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nitāi said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is Nitāi <span class="Italic">dāsa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Our Nitāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Nitāi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, our Nitāi? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He said he couldn't understand it, but he thought, he said that he thought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He manufactured his idea. Therefore he's a rascal. Therefore he's a rascal. Nitāi has become an authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, actually he said that he thought...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He thought something rascaldom, and he is expressing that. Therefore he is more rascal. These things are going on. As soon as he reads some books, he becomes an <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> whatever rascal he may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So there's no doubt that Lord Brahm is a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever he may be, he is <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> So you... Then Kṛṣṇa is also passionate. Kṛṣṇa is also passionate. Kṛṣṇa danced with so many <span class="Italic">gopīs;</span> therefore He is passionate. They... These things are to be seen in this way, that "Such exalted person, he sometimes become passionate, so how much we shall be careful." This is the instruction. Then we petty things, petty persons, how much we shall be careful. It is not that "<span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> has become passionate, therefore I shall become passionate. I am strict followers of <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>" These rascals say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harisauri:</span> So Lord Brahma's being attracted to his daughter, that is just as an example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you discuss this? Therefore you shall be attracted with your daughter, mother? Do you think so, like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In this world this is our disease. This is our disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That disease... Brahma... Lord Śiva also, he was attracted to the Mohinī. So they are <span class="Italic">īśvara.</span> They are controllers. So the instruction is that even such personalities may be sexually attracted, so how much we shall remain careful. This is the instruction. [break] ...like the other rascal. Who was saying that "Kṛṣṇa was killed by a hunter; therefore hunter is greater than Kṛṣṇa"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Raja Gopalācārya, he has written in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> that Kṛṣṇa was killed by a hunter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the hunter is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> "Kṛṣṇa Passes Away," the heading of his chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You said about a couple of years ago that "What ordinary man would be killed if he was shot in the arrow by a heel," I mean, "shot in the heel by an arrow?" No ordinary man dies that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who reads Raja Gopalācārya's <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata?</span> (laughter) They are rotting at Bharatiya Vidyabhavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They're rotting in the bookshelves and the insects are eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But in Somanath... I went last year there when I was in Gujarat. The people, they don't believe, the people of Somanath, that he was killed by... like that. So these philosophers, simply for their name, they put some kind of theories so that people can, "Oh!" They can understand all this nonsense. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These pastimes of Kṛṣṇa is to make the fools more fool. One who is thinking of Kṛṣṇa as ordinary man, Kṛṣṇa is playing this part to show them, "Yes, see. I am dying, this. You see."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> What He said? <span class="Italic">Avajānanti mā mūḍhāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha janmani janmani</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> He'll remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha janmani janmani</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is this pastime. Life after life, he shall remain a fool, rascal. So this Raja Gopalācārya and company, they'll remain in darkness life after life. For them this pastime is there. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti mā mūḍh mānusīm tanum āśritaḥ:</span> "The rascals, they think of Me as ordinary human being." To such rascals, He is playing like: "Yes, you see I am ordinary human being. Just see. I am dying." This is... To keep them life after life in darkness. If it is so easy to understand Kṛṣṇa, that He is dying-<span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> "I have read it. I have seen. He has died." Then what is the use of saying, <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇā sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3]?</span> Out of many millions of persons one can understand Kṛṣṇa. Then what is the use of saying this? If it is so easy to understand Kṛṣṇa, what He is doing, what for He is doing, then everyone could understand Kṛṣṇa. Then what is the use of saying, <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇā sahasreṣu?</span> This requires intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Bahūnā janmanām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā:</span> [Bg. 4.34] "One who knows, go and understand from them, from the guru." Don't make your interpretation, rascal. You shall remain always a rascal. Then what is the use of all these verses? If it is so easy to understand Kṛṣṇa then why Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevaya:</span> "Then you will understand. Go to the right person who has seen."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But the rascal philosophers, they have put in their book that you don't need to go to a spiritual master. Like one lady, she is staying in our temple now. She is a life member from, I think from Kanpur. So I was discussing with her yesterday. She said that "Your devotees, they are forcing me," that she should accept Śrīla Prabhupāda as spiritual master. She said, "No. I know Kṛṣṇa. I am reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span>" And she told me that she has read in the book that one not need to go to spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what she is? Why she is staying here? Huh? You have asked them to go? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> This is the first I have heard of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I am going to tell her to go if she will not... She told me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I never heard this before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No. Is she is staying there as a paying guest or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, she want... She paid us eleven hundred rupees in Kanpur and, I don't know... The devotees, they promised her she can come and she can stay in our temple but they never told her the four regulative principles and to accept the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, that is not true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So she wants the money back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give. Give her back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> She can have it back. That's no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So she should go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give her back. So why don't you give and immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I will give her. She never asked me. I didn't know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> She asked Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, I think. So we will arrange. She should go, you know. She made a great confusion yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's all right. Let her have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let her return the receipt or give a receipt and let her go away. Nobody can stay more than three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. We will do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She can come, but not more than three days in a month. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...rascals will use any excuse to reject all of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is atheism or demonism. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Chinmayananda, when he lectures, he only lectures on the verses that are important. He says all the other ones, they're not really important. He picks out the ones that count.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you cut his head and say that "It is not important. You are talking nonsense. Cut your head."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He don't give any commentary on verses, even important commentary, he speak all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore you say, "This head is not required. You are talking nonsense," and cut his head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No one knows what he's talking about anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Especially him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. No one can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...become a problem for all these rascals, that we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gīta As It Is.</span> That they are feeling that "If this movement goes on, then we are all finished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Out of work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Their profession is at stake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> One <span class="Italic">Māyāvād sannyāsī,</span> he wrote a book, "<span class="Italic">Be Your Own </span>Guru," and he said you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why do you write book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, he is being guru. He is teaching them to do without a guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let everyone become his guru. Why you write books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...one book that one should not write a book without the permission of a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You'll find in today's tape that Prahlāda Mahārāja recommending, that "Spiritual life begins by <span class="Italic">guru-śuśruṣaḥ,</span> by serving guru." [break] ...Gosvāmi said, <span class="Italic">ādau </span>gurvāśrayam: "The first beginning is to take shelter of the bona fide spiritual master." <span class="Italic">Sad-dharma-pracchāt:</span> "Then inquire from him about the spiritual path." <span class="Italic">Sādhu-mārgānugamanam:</span> "Follow the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span>." These are the steps. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'ha śādhi mām:</span> "Now I become Your disciple. Teach me." And these rascals are more than Arjuna-"There is no need of guru." Huh? He says, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'ham [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why? He was already friend. Why he should submit himself as disciple? That is the beginning of spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Somebody put a question to Bhagavan Rajneesh that "you claim that you are God. Can you show us your universal form?" He said, "Well, I can show you. First you come like an Arjuna. First you become Arjuna. Then I can show you a universal form."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he admits that much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That he cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, he admits that he can, but he has put...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "So that's all right. Have you shown anyone your universal form amongst so many, your disciples? Have you shown?" The next question should be like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He never asked. I was hearing tape in one life member's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, if... You learn that, "Have you shown ever your universal form to any one of your disciples?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There was not such intelligent person to ask this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the... Say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So we have to ask that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he says, "No, none of my students are efficient," "Then why you are preaching? If you cannot make any one of your students as efficient, then why you are preaching, wasting your time?" No, no, these rascal, they, their face should not be seen even. They are so fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But now they all afraid from your stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Prabhupāda, they all thought many times that "Prabhupāda he criticize us." You know, they say. We said, "Yes, you are made to be criticized."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Your stick is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gīta As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say? They say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Oh, yes. In Mauritius there are many cults. So they invited us, I went to two, three. So they asked me that "We are coming many temple. You people, why not you come?" I said, "Well, whenever you invite us, we are ready to come, but you accept our philosophy." So they said, "How we can accept your philosophy? Prabhupāda, he, wherever, he say that all the other are Māyāvādī. All other are rascal." (laughter) "Well, Kṛṣṇa has said that. Prabhupāda is not doing that. Kṛṣṇa said who don't accept Him, he is <span class="Italic">mūḍha;</span> he is rascal. So Prabhupāda is giving as it is, whatever Kṛṣṇa has said." Oh, they were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... [break] Kṛṣṇa said, "The rascals do not surrender to Me." So as soon as we see somebody not Kṛṣṇa conscious, we call him rascal. So what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It is not wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na mā duṣkṛtino mūḍhā prapadyante narādhamāḥ.</span> So we find out rascals, if he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. So what is our fault? Kṛṣṇa says this is the test to find out who is a rascal. And who is rascal? Who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is a rascal. So if you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, you are a rascal. We have to see through the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> characteristic of a rascal, that he is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. That's all. We may be fool, but we take lesson from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That's all. And from the lesson we understand you are rascal number one." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Tilaka's(?) wife, she told me... She was very upset you know. One day she, when she came to see you and that one rascal yogi was there and he said that in the Vedas everything is mentioned that we can drink and woman and the man have equal right. Then you answered her, and she was also saying the same thing and you answered her, "Okay, if woman and the man have equal right, then why not your husband begot the children... Why not you begot the children in the womb of your husband?" And she was very upset, you know. She said, "Prabhupāda sometimes say the things like that which are unreasonable, you know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may require... No, I said that "If you are equal rights, then make some arrangement: sometimes you become pregnant; sometimes he becomes pregnant. Why there is not right, equal right?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> She was telling me when... She... I said that "Prabhupāda sometimes says these things that we feel all ashamed, you know, because..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The medicine is not always palatable for these people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in speaking spiritual understanding we cannot make any compromise. What to speak of in Mauritius, in Chicago I told. There was great agitation in papers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In the TV, on television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Same thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In France also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were very upset. And when I was coming, I think, in Chicago, in the airplane, one of the host girl, she was seeing... (laughter) I asked her to supply one 7-up. And, "I have no key." She was so angry. But all the captains and others, they gathered around me. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think that was the same stewardess who came in the back and asked us, "Why the Swamiji doesn't like women?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't say that I don't like women, but I cannot say that equal rights. How can I say? First of all show that you equal rights-your husband becomes sometimes pregnant and then you become pregnant, alternately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That doesn't mean you don't like them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is truth. I am speaking the truth, that "If you have equal right, then let your husband become pregnant. Make some arrangement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Viśākhā was preaching to her. She said that "Actually we are less intelligent." (laughter) That started a big scandal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] They are in equal right, then... Nowadays, of course, they are thinking like that, that man should remain independent, and they'll have homosex, and the woman also independent and they will make some... This is most immoral things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If only people think that they have equal right...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is equal right? Even in Russia there is no equal rights. They have created some of them are managers, and some of them are workers. Why? If equal rights, then everyone should be manager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, in America they have women senators now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Women senators, women are in charge of companies sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, in India there are two women. They are high commissioners of India to the foreign countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is possible. That it requires education. That is another... By nature the woman's body is different from man's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Women are subordinate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not subordinate actually. The occupations are different. It does not mean... That is another mistake. Just like the leg is walking, and the head is directing, so although the occupation is different, both of them are important. We require the head and leg also. If simply head is there, if there is no leg, then who'll walk? This is the understanding, not equal. Everyone must have his separate duties to serve the whole. That is the arrangement. This is real understanding. The most important part of the body is head, but that does not mean the leg is not important. Leg is important in its work, and head is important in its work. So we require both, head and tail both, not that simply leg or simply head. But when we make comparative study, we can understand that head is more important than the leg. If you cut your leg, you can live, but if you cut your head, you'll die. Therefore the conclusion is: head is more important than the leg. Comparative study. Otherwise head is also required and leg is also required. You collect some flowers, nice flowers, and, add with it some green foliage, it becomes more beautiful. Simply flower is not so beautiful. When it is arrayed with some green foliage, then it becomes more beautiful. So we have to take in that sense. But comparatively, the flower is more important than the foliage. But the both of them are required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The foliage also becomes beautiful because of the flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is God's creation. Just like these trees. They are condemned, but still, with trees we can make a beautiful garden and that is very enjoyable. That is God's arrangement. Even insignificant... Kṣūdrād api pradhānasya jāyate paramaṁ hitam. One is very insignificant and other is very important, but both of them combined together becomes beneficial. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> I remember over five years ago you telling me about, "If you read the first nine cantos of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious." Would you kindly tell me what does it mean to be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you understand, fully Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> What does it mean to be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what you mean, first of all let me know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What do you think fully Kṛṣṇa concious means? You tell Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> It's to see Kṛṣṇa face to face?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means Kṛṣṇa conscious? Everyone is seeing Kṛṣṇa face to face. When you go to the temple Kṛṣṇa is there, and you are seeing. Does it mean everyone is Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the meaning of Kṛṣṇa conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, that is part of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">brahṁa bhūtaḥ.</span> Real Kṛṣṇa consciousness is: "Kṛṣṇa is master, I am servant." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> To understand that you're the servant and Kṛṣṇa is the master. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you fully understand, that is your Kṛṣṇa... That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. [break] So long you think that "I can also become like Kṛṣṇa," then you are not Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> In other words, if you still have material desires you can't be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Make all your material desires zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. You should only desire to serve Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> Very clear. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What if a person doesn't desire material enjoyment, but still, there is so much dirt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Who is that person who has no material desires?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A person really wants to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, but somehow or another, so much dirts gets in the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dirt means it is not yet zero. I said that all material desires should be made zero. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> As soon as the desires completely change, then everything else is purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacana tava, naṣṭo </span><i class="calibre3">mohaḥ</i>: "Now my illusion is over. I agree to act as you say." This is Kṛṣṇa conscious. <span class="Italic">Naṣṭo moha smṛtir labdh tvat prasādān madhusūdana.</span> [break] The <span class="Italic">moha</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Moha</span> means these desires are illusion, like dreaming. In dream we see so many things. They are all false. In dreaming I am seeing that somebody is coming to kill me but there is nobody, but still, I am dreaming. This is called <span class="Italic">moha.</span> So when one is free from <span class="Italic">moha,</span> then he's Kṛṣṇa conscious. The whole material world is going on under such illusion. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you. (end)</div>
