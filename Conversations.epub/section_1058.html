<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they continually going on giving information, rocks and sand. Why do you take so much trouble of going to Mars and this? If your go.... It is already concluded that we shall give this because they are already under the impression that all other planets are vacant. The same thing after spending millions of dollars, they're giving the same verdict. So why do this business? Simply cheating. They're cheating their boss that "We are making research." The result of research is the same. They're silent now, this Mars excursion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they'll say? There is nothing to say. They do not go and even they go, they take photograph from millions of miles. What is the value of these things? But people are accepting that "Oh, scientific research." Perhaps I am the only man in the world who is protesting. (laughs) Eh? Everyone is accepting, "Oh, it is scientific."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> People are being duped now into believing that advancement means simply to research. Not to actually find out anything valuable, but just to do some research. They think that that's the whole thing, education is just to research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the European, you don't get the result, go on researching and spoil the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa has manufactured everything in such a complicated way, that their search is never-ending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That article written by Svarūpa Dāmodara in the recent <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> That was not.... Oh, which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The recent this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> The newest one? That was not by Svarūpa Dāmodara. That was by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-Sauri:</span> Dāmodara Dāsa and Jagjīvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Svarūpa Dāmodara is different. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is more like a commentary than science, as it exists today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is like a presentation of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes, these article. (pause) That's all right. Hm. (end)</div>
