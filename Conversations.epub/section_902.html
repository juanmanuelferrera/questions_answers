<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Kṛṣṇa has made lot of things for human beings to enjoy-the trees and rivers and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the Vedic version-<span class="Italic">pūrṇam idam [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">,</span> everything is complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It says in the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> that animals were given to the man for protection and for service, they could take service from the animals. And they think the slaughtering of an animal is all right on that basis, that God gave the animals to the human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how intelligent they are. I give you my child for your protection, and you cut his throat. How intelligent you are. That is the proof. Something is given for protection, and they're cutting the throat. This is their intelligence. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...the article in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> there was a question raised, that "What is purpose of life?" and it was stated that the purpose of life is to realize God. Could you kindly explain a little more on that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining last night. Human life is meant for understanding what is the goal of life. The goal of life is to go back to home, back to Godhead. If they do not go back to home, back to Godhead, then remain here, become a tree. Stand, for five thousand years. <span class="Italic">Sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> Two millions you have to pass through. And each species, some thousands of years. And such two million. So, how many years? Hmm? Two millions of varieties of vegetables. And each item, if you pass, say hundred years. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two hundred million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two hundred millions years only for passing through the vegetables. Then you become insects. That is also 1,100,000. In this way you'll get chance again to become a human being. These rascals are wasting, four-wheel dog. (laughter) Dogs are four-legged, and we are four-wheeled. That's all. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, everyone has to go through all the 84,000,000 journeys(?), or is that to, like, you know, on his pious or impious <span class="Italic">karma</span> he might go through only the vegetable class or he might go through only the animal life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will depend on your <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's one thing in the human nature, that he always thinks that he's the chief and around the world everything is running around him, and most probably he always can show off that "I am the leader of everything." Why is it so? In every person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the disease, material disease. That is material disease. Everyone wants to become Kṛṣṇa. Nobody wants to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is material. <span class="Italic">Kartāham iti manyate. Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> Rascal bewildered by false egotism, he's thinking "I am everything." That is material life. And when by cultivation of knowledge, good association, you come to the conclusion that "I am not everything, Kṛṣṇa is everything; I am His servant," then perfection. Otherwise he's in the <span class="Italic">māyā-cakra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Is this related to the past, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the material disease. When you contaminate some disease, do not try to find out the history. Treat the disease. That is intelligence. How I got this disease, instead of inquiring, better treat the disease. That is intelligence. Go to the doctor and get treatment and cure it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> Kṛṣṇa has said, "Do your duty, look after..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not know what is your duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, that's what we are trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Know from Kṛṣṇa what is your duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Now, to know this thing, we have to really follow, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all, what you are? Then your duty. Are you clerk or ordinary orderly or the director or something, something? Then your duty. But if you do not know what you are, then where is your duty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But if you know certain things and if you do honesty for Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I.... You do not know anything. That is your position. You must know what is your position. Then your duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> My position you mean in relation to Kṛṣṇa or in relation to the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in relation to the world. In relationship with the world, therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is your quality? Then you are classified as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Then your duty. First of all you must know what you are, what is your position. Then there is duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> is it right that if you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all the duties are automatically taken care of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the duties, the summarization of duty: <span class="Italic">ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> There are different duties, but the real duty is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam [SB 1.2.13],</span> whether you have satisfied Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll have done all.... <span class="Italic">Ataḥ pumbhiḥ.</span> Because there are different types of duties. But whatever you do, the success is whether by your duty you have satisfied Kṛṣṇa. Then it is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Prabhu,</span> how do you regard the detachment idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of detachment. These are all bogus propaganda. You cannot be detached. Duty does not mean detachment. You have to do your duty. There is attachment. Where is the detachment? These are simply bogus propaganda. There cannot be detachment. Detachment means, real detachment means that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. So you have no proprietorship. That is detachment. If you falsely claim "It is mine," that is attachment, unnecessary. It is not yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Should we not move from attachment to detachment gradually, and try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You cannot do that. Your attachment has to be purified. Just like this land. The Canadians think "This is my land," but this, when it is purified, it is this land God's land, then it is purified. And so long you falsely claim "It is my land," that is cause of all trouble.</div>
<div class="Verse">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yat kiñca jagatyāṁ jagat<br class="calibre2"/>tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā<br class="calibre2"/>mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Īśo mantra 1]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">Just a minute ago we were talking that in Canada there is so much land, and you told me there is so many fertile. Huh, you told me? But they'll not allow anybody to come. This is wrong position. Why? China or India, there are so many countries overcongested. Let them come. But he's thinking, "It my land."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> They pay the money to a farmer not to grow the wheat here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. This rascaldom is going on in the name of civilization. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1], </span>they do not know. Everything belongs to God, and are all sons of God. So by God's arrangement there is enough land to live, enough land to produce food. They're misusing. Therefore the whole trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Prabhu,</span> then what that means, what we mean is they should have <span class="Italic">rsabandutra</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is, a <span class="Italic">rsabandutra</span>(?) means, unless you have got the central point. How we can have? First of all you know Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> They must have a common background, common ground whereby you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they haven't got. Common.... He is trying to become Kṛṣṇa. Everything is rolling around. So this is the mistake. He's trying to become center, that foolish rascal. How he's center? Center is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> So the only hope for humanity is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, only hope. Therefore this verse I was explaining.</div>
<div class="Verse">aśraddadhānāḥ puruṣā<br class="calibre2"/>dharmasyāsya parantapa<br class="calibre2"/>aprāpya māṁ nivartante<br class="calibre2"/>mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.3]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Those who will not take this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, these rascal will remain in the cycle of birth and death. Instead of taking Kṛṣṇa's instruction, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> he's trying to become Kṛṣṇa, these rascals. So how there will be peace? Hmm? Kṛṣṇa says "Surrender unto Me." He's saying, "I am Kṛṣṇa. Why shall I surrender?" This is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Mr. Sharma, he's our accountant. He works at the University of Toronto. He does all our books here in Toronto to help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, thank you. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsa:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80] "I'm the servant, servant, servant of the servant of Kṛṣṇa." And these rascals are learning how to become Kṛṣṇa. Just see, it is impossible. (laughs) But they will try for it. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Only one thing I just want to clarify, that under human behavior towards the society, honest behavior toward the society, to help the people, to help the neighbors and like that, try to help...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, tell me, what is your power to help? You are poor yourself. What you can help? Then why you are talking all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No, <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> supposing if we see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot help. First of all, you cannot help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can help, you can simply repeat the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise you have no power to help. It is all concoction. Vivekananda, for the last hundred years-<span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> He could not do anything. First of all you must know that you have no capacity to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Right. That is true, <span class="Italic">prabhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you propose to help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No, but <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> how far is it fair that if one is religious, say chanting and regulations and everything he is doing, and on the other hand, he doesn't behave as a good honest labor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That good honest..., you have got some idea of good honest. But because he's chanting, he's all good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Prabhupāda, because he's chanting, sometimes a person get very false ego, that he has become a very big devotee, he's serving the Lord, and he tries to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, he's on the line of goodness. But those who are not chanting, they're all bad. Do you understand it or not? <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> One who is not a devotee of God, he has no good qualification. You may propose that "I am so much good, I am this, I am that," but it is all bogus thing. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's simply concocting in the mind. And so far a devotee's concerned, even you find some defect in him, he's <span class="Italic">sādhu. Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">. Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now I find some defective state. <span class="Italic">Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā.</span> These defects will be out very soon. Don't bother. But because he is devotee, he's <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> So you mean to say, <span class="Italic">prabhu,</span> truthfulness and honesty will come after chanting, chanting, chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But those who are not devotees, there is no truthfulness at all. Here he has begun truthfulness. But one who is not a devotee, he has no question of truthfulness. He's simply concocting in the mind. <span class="Italic">Manorathena.</span> And because he's on the mental platform, he'll do all bad things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Therefore devotee must try to be honest and truthful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotee becomes automatically. If he sticks to the devotional principles, he'll become good very soon. Just like he has stopped. Devotee means, just like we say, no illicit sex, no drinking or intoxication, no meat-eating. So he has adopted this, and chanting. That is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Prabhu,</span> these things (indistinct) we say. Indian women or even men, those who are in the village life. Well, I don't say all, but most of them, they obey these things right from the very childhood itself. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are jumping to the village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Well village is a little bit pure life you know, but in the cities of course people get involved too much in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure life, village-doesn't matter village or city. If you become devotee, then pure life. It is not that because one is living in city, therefore he's polluted, one is living in village, no. Unless one becomes devotee, there is no question of becoming good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Prabhupāda, there's a very important question in my mind all the time. How a Godbrother should treat the Godbrother with great (indistinct) to produce more love of Godhead and to (indistinct) in them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You show example. If other Godbrother is not treating you well, you treat him well. Then it will be right. Why you should deviate, that "This Godbrother is not treating me well, so I shall do also"? <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari' prabhu jīvera.</span> You treat well. You show the example how to treat his Godbrother. [break] ...Mahāprabhu's teaching,</div>
<div class="Verse">tṛṇād api sunīcena<br class="calibre2"/>taror api sahiṣṇunā<br class="calibre2"/>amāninā mānadena<br class="calibre2"/>kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Ādi 17.31]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So who is treating me good or bad, I don't want to bother about it. Let me become humbler than the grass, tolerant than the tree, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">haribol</span>. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...nice garden, but if anyone wants to live here, the government will not allow. (laughter) "Go to the mill(?)."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Prabhupāda, a devotee, very often after chanting why they develop very, very high. I see a lot of devotees, they falls down back to the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not devotee. He's pretending to be devotee. One who is devotee never falls down. There are so many false devotees. He falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda? In 3.4 <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> Lord Kapiladeva speaks about the feeling of loss, the conditioned soul in the material world when he's identifying with matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Kapiladeva speaks about the feeling of being lost. Is that what the psychologists say is craziness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-Kṛṣṇa:</span> The feeling of being lost. Kapiladeva's instructions? He wants to know if the identification with matter is the same thing as craziness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> (Sanskrit) What is that verse? Everyone is working under illusion of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> until he comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it better for <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> to be self-supporting and living outside the temple? Like somebody working all day and following the regulative principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple is meant for rendering service to the Lord. So if anyone is rendering service to the Lord, he can live. But not for sense gratification. Those <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> who still have desire for sense gratification, they may live outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> What about the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span>'s duty toward his family, like looking after his family and children? In India, like when you have a daughter you have to get her married and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when you have accepted family life, you must be responsible to carry out. Not that I become family man all of a sudden I give up everything. No, that is not wanted. But if one is actually advanced, he can give up everything. He has no more duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> But the question comes up that you have given a vow against fire at the time of marriage that the husband will look after the wife and the family. Then how does that fit in when you leave the family all of a sudden? Is there not a responsibility to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, not all of a sudden. All of a sudden..., generally you have to discharge the duties of family life, and at the ripe age, when everything is settled up, then you give up the family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> Is it right that all the responsibility should be cleared up before...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot clear up all the responsibility. Therefore up to fiftieth year. After that, whatever is done, that's all. (Sanskrit) But our philosophy is there is no question of giving up this or taking up that. Simply take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Wherever you remain, it doesn't matter. Either in family life or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> In the <span class="Italic">vānaprastha āśrama,</span> after fifty years of age, what is the duty? Is it to live in the temple, or devote most of time to Kṛṣṇa, or where the wife comes in then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple you should live always. Even if in family life, you must come to the temple. Temple worship is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you wrote a lot of books, and I'm very much concerned about the books. A lot of devotees, they never read the books, but they're doing the chanting. It will progress them without reading the books, because they're the most important...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But suppose one is illiterate, how he'll read? How he'll read if one is illiterate? That means he has no chance? Because he's illiterate? Chanting is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is it possible for people in the most animalistic conditions of life such as the Eskimos, who need meat to survive-is it possible for these people to become purified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ, śudhyanti</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> By the guidance of the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> You've already proved that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> We're worse than Eskimos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (indistinct) What about the verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> that says if a devotee falls down that he's not to be considered as the fruitive workers or the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> etcetera.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Falls down means again when he revives, he'll begin from that point, where he fell down. [break] ...it is to be understood that polluted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That's also sinful reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Polluted means sinful. (end)</div>
