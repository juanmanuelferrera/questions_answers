<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...persons serving, taking people who are serving Kṛṣṇa into serving their sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Engage them. <span class="Italic">māyā...</span> It is not actually <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> fault, this <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> business that all living entities who are within this material world, they have come to enjoy. Enjoy means sense gratification. So <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is kind enough to give them all facilities. That is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> business. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has a machine, these three qualities, and as I want to enjoy, so there are departmental arrangements, "Give him facilities like this." <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But the facility turns out to be slaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Slaps... We will go on the street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> It's not very... It's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us see. [break] Just like children, they are given some facilities. They must work according to that plan. Otherwise sometimes there is slap, "Huh, why you are doing like that?" like that. [break] ...your country. <span class="Italic">Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrā-bhaumya idya-dhīḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">. Bhaumya</span> means <span class="Italic">bhūmi. Bhūmi,</span> the land, <span class="Italic">idya-dhīḥ:</span> "This is my duty: to serve my country, to serve my land." This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> The rascal, he is engaged to "Do your duty to your country," and what is the country? Suppose if I do my duty and I may be driven away from my country next life, because there is no guarantee that I will have to take my birth... Just like one astrologer has explained that Jawaharlal Nehru has become a dog in Scandinavia. (laughs) There is chance. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> You will have to change your body. Now, where it will be changed, how it will be changed, what kind of body you will get-that is not in your hands. That is not in your hands. You cannot say, "Oh, I am Prime Minister. I must get such and such body." That is not going to be accepted. But these foolish rascal people, they do not understand it. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> I am acting under certain infection. So I am infecting, say, some venereal disease. So I must suffer for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Mahatma Gandhi worked so hard for his country and his own countrymen shot him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Still, these fools, they do not know what is service, what is country, what is... They do not know this is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break] By nature's mercy, they got this nice human form of body, civilized. There is sufficient food, supplied by nature. You eat and be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Take advantage of the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> lessons left by Kṛṣṇa and His devotees. Live peacefully, happily, and go back wherefrom you have come. But whole thing is spoiled by these misleaders. "Do your duty to your country." (laughs) What is that duty? I am working under the influence of material nature, and what is my duty? My only duty is to come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is my duty. [break] ...because we are prescribing so many duties, and there is no God. That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> You said that everyone could become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> in your lecture, last night. But at the same time there must always be the legs of society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Legs are already there. Everyone is now legs. So they can be promoted to become heads. What is the difficulty? Everyone is in the eighth class. Does it mean that he cannot pass MA examination? If he is trained up, he can pass M.A. exam...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But as long as there is material world, there will always be <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Not will be. All, everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> This movement is to promote the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> to the highest class, Vaiṣṇava, more than <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Everyone is rascal, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...śūdras</span> should be elevated, elevated, but when even a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is engaged in the service of the Lord, he becomes transcendental, above <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It said that eight people were shot in Aurangabad with student riots, and the police got their guns and they started to shoot all the people. The same thing is happening in Gaya. The students are protesting against this and that. It said that they were protesting against degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Degradation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. That is supposed to be the reason for their rebellion. They are protesting against corruption and degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the rascals, why they themselves do not, be not reformed? Protesting against degradation. Why you are degraded? What is that protest? You are degraded. You reform yourself. That they will not do. Protest against degradation. Are you not degraded? Are you pure? So what is the use of protesting? You reform yourself. They can protest in this way that our guardians, our government, they have degraded ourselves. But that's all right. But guardian is a fool, your father is a fool. But why you are remaining as a fool? That they will not an... If we say, "Now you come to us. We shall raise you from degradation," that they will not do. That they will not agree. Now go to them, all these students, that "You are thinking that you are degraded. So why you should be, mean dog...? Come on, we shall reform you. We shall give you the highest post, brahminical post. Give up these four principles." That they will not do. Will they do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No. One may come out of a thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They want to remain in degradation, and they will protest again. Therefore to save the degradation, this <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyam</span> must be established. That I... The ideal class. People will follow, "Oh, here is the ideal class." So we are trying to make an ideal class of Kṛṣṇa conscious people. And if you treat yourself as degraded, then who will care for you? You should remain an ideal class. People will follow gradually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> If a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class is created, then automatically the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> will be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. The ideal, if you be ideal class, gradually they will take your advice, what to do. Then immediately the whole degradation will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Why will they take advice? Will they actually be attracted to the virtues?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, naturally. Just like people come to see me. Similarly, everyone comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everyone is attracted to you, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you should be such qualified that people will come to consult you, to take your advice, and... That is the way. [break] ...one after another. Just like if you are a qualified lawyer, when one has difficulty, he comes, consults you, what to do. If you are a qualified physician, then people will come to consult you. So you become qualified, ideal; people will come. Otherwise who will care for you? [break] ...principles. No illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating and chanting. These five things only, if you strictly remain on these principles, see how you are respectable. Immediately you'll be respected. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everyone knows that it should be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everyone knows in their heart that these things are right. Before I came to the movement, when I read the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine, they are doing these things, I was not doing them all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are making propaganda in USA. They are attracting attention of the people. Yes. They are saying nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Whenever we see those four rules...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals, they cannot give up even smoking, ordinary thing. And they become leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> It is not very difficult to give up. If one is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is not difficult to give up these four things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all. Very easily, in one second. If you have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. These are sinful activities. Immediately Kṛṣṇa will help you, "All right." Immediately. Kṛṣṇa said. Is He bluffing? If you sincerely take to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet, immediately the effect will be you give up all this nonsense. They don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, they don't believe in Kṛṣṇa's word; neither they will surrender; neither they will give up. So where is the reformation? They want to remain in degradation and protesting... This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> This is the called, <span class="Italic">prakṣepātmika śakti,</span> to keep him in degradation, that "You rascal, you have come to enjoy material happiness. So I will keep you in this degradation and you suffer. I shall kick on your face." This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So what is the result of this protest against degradation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They get shot. The police come and shoot them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. And tax you and get fat salary. That's all. This is government. They will degrade you and take your money and enjoy themselves. That's all. [break] ...revolution in India. Yes. Because people are hungry. There is no food. A very great revolution. So long they were under Vedic culture, they were suffering. Suffering in this way-tolerating. Now that culture is gone. Now they will be violent. Just like in other countries. If you pinch somebody on and on, there will be a violent protest. In the beginning you may tolerate. But if you go on pinching, pinching, pinching, how long you will tolerate? This is India's condition. Britishers, when they were ruling, had some responsibility. Although they were exploiting, but they were arranging for sufficient food and other things. But these people are irresponsib..., simply personal. "Whatever money I can get, that's all." This is going on. All these so-called ministers, they come to the post for taking money, as much as possible. [break] It must have been belonging to some Nawab, Nizam. It is aristocratic building, not ordinary building. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...it could be favorable for our movement? Because we can, people will be very much frustrated at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, people are now shameless, you see? They are being kicked in so many ways. We are giving the prescription, "Here is the remedy," but they are not taking to it. But they will take it. Some of them will take it, provided you remain also ideal. If you become also degraded, then who will take it? Ideal character, ideal behavior, ideal preaching. People will appreciate. [break] ...pure character or position, people will take, in any condition. There may be revolution or no revolution. They will take it. [break] ...that our movement is actually good. They will take in any condition. That standard we must maintain. Somebody... Yes, Balavanta, when he was speaking against smoking, one candidate-he was important man-he was smoking. Immediately he wanted to hide. (laughter) So immediate effect was there. He understood that "Yes, this is bad habit." So people will take it, any condition, provided you are ideal. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari prabhu jīveri śikṣāya.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement. He teaches others by behaving Himself. "Example is better than precept." If you cannot rise early in the morning, then how can you ask others to rise early in the morning? What is the effect? There is no effect. We have got business early in the morning, to attend <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati.</span> And if you sleep yourself and teach others, so who will take it? [break] ...we have introduced. Very, very simple thing. But still, if he cannot... [break] ...(indistinct) Mahārāja. He is, he admitted him, <span class="Italic">smārta paṇḍita,</span> but he cannot rise early in the morning. Never. And he is imitating the <span class="Italic">smārta paṇḍitas.</span> You know that? <span class="Italic">Smārta,</span> and one pot, and this and that and <span class="Italic">āsana</span> (laughing). And "I had some..., consult with some <span class="Italic">smārta paṇḍita,</span>" and the real business, to rise early in the morning, he will never do. He will never do. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa</span> means he must rise early in the morning. What kind of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> Oh, he is coming. (laughs) Early in the morning at half past seven. If he walks early in the morning, all his disease will be cured. That he will not do. After all, everyone can do after performing <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> take a morning walk. Bathing. [break] How did you know we were here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I asked (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you rise early and take a walk, all your ailments will be cured. [break] If a gentleman wants to walk early in the morning, he must have his dog friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They have a saying that dog is man's best friend now. Instead of God being man's best friend, they have made it dog is man's best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like he is a dog. [break] ...strike. Simply strike, protest. Where is happiness? [break] ...unnecessary spending. Unnecessary spending, then why you have allowed opening cinema? One side advertisement, "Unnecessary spending," and the other side so many rascal things, so people will spend for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But they will say, "You must have some time to relax."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is unnecessary. Everyone will say, "What I am spending unnecessarily that is my relax." [break] ...government officer will have a big bungalow and now there is act that "Others, if he has got a big bungalow like this bungalow, this is unnecessary." Now it is prepared to act(?). And for minister, it is relax, and for common man it is unnecessary. This is then... "Smoking for me, it is relax, and for you it is unnecessary." These rascals are preaching like that. If smoking is unnecessary, it is unnecessary for me and for you also. "No. For me it is relax." [break] Is that their advertisement? Save money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And as soon as you save, they will take income tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They have a wealth tax. So if you save that means you have more wealth, and then they tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they will "relax" by drinking, "relax" minister. "You save money for our relaxation. That is our necessary. You don't spend money." And people are... Because they see that "If I save, it will be taken away. Let me spend lavishly." Yes. Just like we stayed there at Mr. Patel's house. There are three men only in the family: Mr. Patel, his son and his daughter-in-law. They have got eight cars, big, big cars, Rolls Royce. And about twenty servants. They know that "They will take it away. Better spend." Everyone is doing that. Because they know, "If I save, one day the government will take 98 per cent of my savings. Then why save? Better spend." They cannot give in religious institution. If they say they want to give something, no, that will not allowed. Yes. The whole idea is that "You save, and one day I shall take the whole money and we shall distribute amongst the ministers, Indira Gandhi and company. And we relax. We are working so hard, how to impose taxes upon you. So we must have relax." This is going on. Vicious society. [break] ...open. Let us open. (end)</div>
