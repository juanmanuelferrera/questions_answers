<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...a bona fide spiritual master. Bona fide spiritual master means who carries out the order of higher authorities. Otherwise he is not spiritual master. Anyone who manufactures his own process of religion, that is rascaldom. <span class="Italic">dharmāṁ tu sakṣād bhagavat-praṇitam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like lawyer, representative of the law, means who carries the order of the supreme executive. He is lawyer. Similarly, a spiritual master means who carries the order of superior authority. We are carrying the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa taught this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and He has said that "Anyone who will preach this confidential message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he is very dear to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct) ...and believers in Sai Baba and other we believe in an incorporeal God, <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> So if Kṛṣṇa as Rāma or any other deity or <span class="Italic">devata,</span> one who was definitely a superior <span class="Italic">ātman,</span> no doubt about it, but Paramātman is all other religions' God, if something incorporeal is there, without referring to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says, "incorporeal"? Who says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is scripture. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Who says, "incorporeal"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga.</span> You find it all over India, that, a summary of everything, that incorporeal form, <span class="Italic">jyotir-rūpa,</span> incorporeal. <span class="Italic">Jyotir-liṅga,</span> the Hindu <span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You are bringing something else besides <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just try to understand. We are preaching... This International Society for Krishna Consciousness, we are preaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But you have to understand the relation between the two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all... That we understand very nicely. It is not that I have to learn from you. We know it very well. But you should know that we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So this <span class="Italic">jyotir-liṅga,</span> all these theories, they are not in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It may be in other literature, but we are particularly interested in preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Because <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is wrongly preached all over the world by nonsense commentation, we want to rectify it. Therefore our society is specially named "Krishna conscious."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is wrongly preached about <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wrong... Just like yesterday I went that <span class="Italic">Gītā Samītī.</span> There is a lamp. Why there is a lamp instead of Kṛṣṇa? Why there is a lamp? Kṛṣṇa is a lamp? And it is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know. Therefore I say this is wrongly preaching. Why in the place of Kṛṣṇa there is a lamp? Does Kṛṣṇa say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Lamp has been with us for more than... In our <span class="Italic">mandira...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. (Hindi?) Kṛṣṇa is also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They must evolve with that idea because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First thing is that when we speak of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa. So why there is no Kṛṣṇa photograph?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They didn't put the picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means you have not understood Kṛṣṇa. Therefore your, this so-called <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> society is not bona fide. At least even in ordinary feature, suppose if there is political meeting, you keep Gandhi, this photo, Jawaharlal Nehru's photo because they are the political leaders. You are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Gītā Samītī,</span> and there is not a single picture of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There is little misunderstanding, that <span class="Italic">Gītā Jayantī</span> is for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all answer me this question. Then you go to <span class="Italic">Gītā Jayantī.</span> That, your <span class="Italic">Samītī</span> is <span class="Italic">Gītā Samītī</span> and there is not a single picture of Kṛṣṇa. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We don't know about that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were not there present? Oh. That's not... I think you were present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I never gone there, never been there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is misguided. That's all. Now, <span class="Italic">"Gītā Bhavan,"</span> and they have invited me because we are teaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and that was <span class="Italic">Gītā's Jayantī-</span>and the speaker of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is not present? Therefore I say that there are so many places, here also. They are wrongly representing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So our position is to rectify that wrong propaganda of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is that wrong propaganda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is one of the instance. There are many instances, many instances, many instances. Just like Dr. Radhakrishnan. In the Ninth Chapter there is verse, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Radhakrishnan says, "It is not to the person Kṛṣṇa." Where he gets this nonsense idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that Vivekananda also has said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all nonsense! Therefore I say they are all nonsense, who deviates from the original text of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, by declaring other interpretation as nonsense...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes! You cannot interpret! First of all if you cannot interpret. First of all my proposal, that you cannot interpret.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We'll come to that, that you are not interpreting correctly, does not make me correct. I must be correct also to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am correct so long I present the correct thing, so long I am... If I present Kṛṣṇa as it is, then I am correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> My solution, Swamiji, most respectfully, is how do you judge that "I am correct"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I am presenting what Kṛṣṇa says. First of all you answer this: what is correct, the standard of correctness? You cannot create correctness. When Kṛṣṇa says this, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> "You just surrender unto Me; become My <span class="Italic">bhakta,"</span> how you can say, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." This is not nonsense? If I say, "Give me a glass of..." Hear me. If I say, "Give me a glass of water," if you say, "It is not to Swamiji," is that interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I do not, and again I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, first of all you answer me. If I say, "Give me a glass of water," and you say, "It is not to Swamiji."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct) ...what the Christ says, Mohammed says, everyone says, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them surrender to Christ. But why don't you surrender to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is true, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is true, but you do not know how.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, you see, our... Even your... Even your way of thinking and your purpose is that Lord Kṛṣṇa should be Lord of the whole universe, so...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Lord Kṛṣṇa is lord, universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So that is what you want to talk with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In that case, you will have to satisfy everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am satisfying everybody. I am preaching that. But it is not possible... I am preaching in Europe. Christians, Mohammedans, Jews, they are surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. So I am doing my duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If I would be permitted, I would very humbly submit that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not. You have not to surrender, you may bring some argument, but where I am preaching, they are surrendering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You are doing a very wonderful work, there is no doubt about it, but the thing is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not like that wonderful work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...judging duty of what we are doing, this is somebody else and not we ourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now... What you... My point is that our society is clearly giving you the indication that we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Every society has taken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that's all right. If you like this Kṛṣṇa philosophy, you are welcome. Otherwise you leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have come here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because first of all see that you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If you reject...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Don't talk, all together. First of all you must know what is the truth. If your standard of truth is different and my standard of truth is different, then where is the use of talking nonsense? If you have any other truth than Kṛṣṇa, you be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Seeking knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seeking God is sufficient. If you take... First of all you know my position. Suppose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I understand your position and I have from the beginning said most respectfully. I beg to submit and what my submission is that, as a seeker of knowledge, I come to you. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that... Do you know what is the process of seeking knowledge? Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all answer me. You are seeking knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The thing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you also hear me. First of all let me know what is the process of seeking knowledge. You cannot make your own process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The concepts have changed. You are making a change from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all you know that I am speaking from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> Is it not? <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena.</span> You have to surrender first of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Surrender to whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone wherefrom you are seeking knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Ah! Surrender and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You lose your identity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all you have to find out a person where you can surrender. Then you can ask and you can seek knowledge. Otherwise there is no... Simply waste of time. Why should you waste your time? Why shall I waste my time? Are you surrendered to me? If you are not surrendered to me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Stop this. Just try to understand. If you are not surrendered to me you have no right to ask me anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Before one surrenders to somebody, he should be satisfied first with the questions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore... Yes. So that, that... Now that satisfaction, I cannot satisfy for your whims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is not a whim...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, one thing is that I am preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If you talk on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you can ask me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yesterday you said in our nice gathering, I remember, that we have to rise above body consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is in the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And we have to be soul conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Now, the idea of rising above body consciousness is to sell off the wild things, <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, ahaṅkāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, that is one thing that is there in all scriptures. The <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> also says that <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, ahaṅkāra</span> must be checked. Now, if we move with that pride and arrogance that "We are the only correct calling. This is the only correct path," and that "You have to surrender from the beginning," now that only aggravates the pride in a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what can I do? Kṛṣṇa says... If you talk, two, I cannot answer. You talk with me, one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, we have talked with reasoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Don't talk, two. I cannot answer with all these reasons. Either you talk or then let him talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am talking. I am talking now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you talk. Let him talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So we have to tear all these vices that are connected with our body. That is our purpose of getting into either <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> or <span class="Italic">nāma, bhāgavata</span> or whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But in that way, if you talk from that, another way of <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra</span> and pride, then things cannot go far. Things cannot go far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So shall I answer now? Now you stop; I answer. Now Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> So even though you have got so many sinful life, Kṛṣṇa assures that "If you surrender unto Me I shall give you protection from the reaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That is another thing. Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa, yes. Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Surrender to Kṛṣṇa, not surrender to all who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Surrender to Kṛṣṇa. We are saying not "Surrender unto me." We say, always saying, "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Therefore the same word. I am not saying that "I have become Kṛṣṇa. I have become God. You surrender to me." We are preaching, "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. So we are not speaking differently from Kṛṣṇa. You try to understand. We are saying... Suppose if I say, "Give me a glass of water," and if you say, "Oh, give Swamiji immediately a glass of ...," the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa also says in <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you try to understand this, that Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "only unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> "I am the only one." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again you are speaking. I am talking with him. Again you are speaking. No, no. I cannot answer in that way. Let him talk. No, no. You stopped me. Let him talk. Otherwise it is not possible. You put some question; he puts some question. It is not possible. Now Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now what do you say? He is very proud?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He's entitled to be proud. If a person has said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Let him say that, but it doesn't mean everybody will be able to follow. That doesn't mean that. Maybe He has said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then He doesn't say. You say, "If you follow me." Now it is your discretion to follow Him or not to follow Him. Kṛṣṇa said this to Arjuna. That does not mean everyone of the world, like Arjuna, surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. Anyone, if he says, even Kṛṣṇa, or God, says, it is not that everyone follows that. That independence you have got. But our philosophy is that Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me," and we are imploring, we are begging persons, that "You please surrender to Kṛṣṇa." Now it is <span class="Italic">your</span> discretion. Whether you surrender to Kṛṣṇa or Lord Śiva, that is your discretion. But our preaching method is we are trying to preach in the world, "Please surrender to Kṛṣṇa." That is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Sir, can I speak now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> With your permission, I believe in <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> I believe in this thing, that it is the Lord who says:</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-dharmān parityajya<br class="calibre2"/>mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.66]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">And still, He says also in Seventh, Eighth and Ninth Chapters of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> that (Sanskrit) "I do not take part in that ordinary things and I cannot be seen by the naked eye."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you find...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Kṛṣṇa was body incarnate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you mean to say that Kṛṣṇa contradicts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, not Kṛṣṇa contradicts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you bring this question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> The <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is... Sir, if I may be permitted to continue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Gītā jñāna</span> itself is given by Lord incorporeal, not to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, it is told, at the time the <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> was given had a body which became <span class="Italic">divya Vedānta</span>(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is your interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That is exactly what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you say. Anyone who... Anyone... Whatever he says, he thinks like that, exact. That is another thing. But we know that Kṛṣṇa had no difference between His body and soul. He is absolute. Now, you are talking from the point of view that Kṛṣṇa's body and Kṛṣṇa's soul is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Ah, no... In every body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the fact. That is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, Kṛṣṇa could not the two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you say, "could not," but we do not say like that. Now who will settle up this thing? You say, but I do not say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> If you say, "This is not the body..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. We are to speak on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We are talking of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">mām ekam.</span> He never says that "to My soul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No. He says, "I am one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He is one, both body and soul, one. That is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, material aspect in your understanding, they are one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He is nonmaterial. Therefore He has spoken... No, no, if you compare with Him ordinary man, then at once you become a <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā.</span> No, you say... This is the saying of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā manuṣīṁ tanum āśritaḥ [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) "Because I have taken this human form of life, the rascals, they think I am a human being." It is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think... As my understanding of this aspect is concerned, He says, "When I adopt this medium through which I give this <span class="Italic">jñāna, mūḍhā-matī</span> do not understand Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, <span class="Italic">mūḍhā-matī,</span> how to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> "Cannot recognize Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose I am <span class="Italic">mūḍhā-matī,</span> so how I am to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but Kṛṣṇa as a body form could be seen and could be recognized by people as such. So there was no question of not understanding him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thing is that whatever I have understood about Kṛṣṇa I haven't got to learn from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, you don't have to learn from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what you have to learn...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I am not speaking my own views. I have got my <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> my teachers, Rāmānujācārya, Śaṅkarācārya, Madhvācārya. So it is all right. It is all right. I have got so many authorities. What authority you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am, myself, in my own senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, you are not authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am not but my own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am following so many authorities. Then... Then there is no question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I am only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are yourself authority. Now, if you say my views are not correct, I may be incorrect but I am following the predecessor. I am taking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What is the difference there? Sir, I accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Hundred per cent, you are very correct in saying what you have just said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I want to understand that point of view. That is why I have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this is the point of understanding. That I have already told you, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that if you want to understand, first of all you have to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Surrender to whom? Not to the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> but to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all find out whom to surrender, then talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...supreme <span class="Italic">ācārya</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. If you think that you are not fit for my surrender, that's all right. But first of all you find out somebody where you can surrender; then talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> To <span class="Italic">jñāna-datta</span> Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. If you surrender and if you get <span class="Italic">jñāna-datta,</span> that is all right. So far we are concerned, if we do not surrender, if you do not surrender, then you simply waste our time, idle talk. This is not the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You have to treat the person with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> For seeking knowledge from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are not seeking knowledge. You have come to challenge it. You have come to challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, no, no... (several Indian men talk at once)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, you are saying that Kṛṣṇa says that incorporeal. But Kṛṣṇa says that "Anyone who thinks that I am incorporeal, that he is a fool."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Quite right. Lord Kṛṣṇa as such, if anybody calls Him incorporeal, he's a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because He has a body, He has taken birth from Devaki. And incorporeal does not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the Kṛṣṇa says that one has to understand that what is Kṛṣṇa's birth. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam yo jānāti tattvataḥ.</span> So that <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ</span> is not <span class="Italic">yo.</span> Anyone who knows Kṛṣṇa actually, he becomes immediately liberated. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone simply who understands Kṛṣṇa, he becomes immediately liberated. If you understood Kṛṣṇa correctly, then you are liberated person. You have nothing to ask from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all. Then you are liberated person. You have nothing to ask from me. I am for those who are conditioned, but you are liberated, so you have nothing to ask from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Rest of us, we persons, go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are liberated; you have nothing to go. If you are liberated, then you have nothing to seek, knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Thank you for listening. Time and place. He's already said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you are liberated, you have nothing to go anywhere because you know everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> May I again submit with the honor that you have bestowed on me of having said that I am already liberated according to the version of <span class="Italic">Gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have understood Kṛṣṇa, then you are liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I still feel... I still feel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you haven't got to seek knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I still feel that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You be satisfied with yourself. You are liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> That means those who are to follow you are not liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not follow... Er, I don't say, "Follow me." I say, "Follow Kṛṣṇa." Why...? Don't mistake that. I say... My vision is that Kṛṣṇa says, "Surrender unto Me." I say, "You and everyone, surrender to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> That you make wherever you are spreading, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is my business. Where I am spreading or not, that is my business. But I am saying this, that Kṛṣṇa says you surrender unto Kṛṣṇa, "Surrender unto Me." I say, "Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa." Is there any difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not according to <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span> Is it not according to <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span> If I say, "Surrender unto Kṛṣṇa"...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> ...if each and every person has an individual identity of (indistinct) soul above the body consciousness and unless you treat him as equal, there is little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody... You cannot say... Even though they are equal, you can see equal but they are not equal. They are not equal. There are three <span class="Italic">guṇas,</span> and in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that is analyzed, that "These persons are in the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> these persons are in the <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> these persons are in..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> That is not personality of the <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> but the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is everybody's soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all... First of all we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> If you have potency to rise and go higher and higher...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not on the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> stage; I am not in the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> stage. You are in the bodily stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Both, body and soul, together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if you are in the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> stage, then you have no argument with me. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But argument, you have admitted that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no argument. That will stop. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> It is on arguments get down...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you are... Just see. This is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita,</span> that:</div>
<div class="Verse">vidyā-vinaya-sampanne<br class="calibre2"/>brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br class="calibre2"/>śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br class="calibre2"/>paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 5.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If you are in the spiritual platform, then you will see a learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a dog, a <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla,</span> a elephant-they are in the same stage. So there is no argument because he sees a dog and the learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> the same position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That is the correct position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is correct position. But if you find that "Swamiji is not on the standard," that means you are not in the posit..., <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ</span> even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> You mean if a person commits a murder, a sinner...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is very high stage. That is very high stage, <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, no. If a person commits a murder, you are seeing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you see, you are seeing, "Commits murder?" Why don't you see that it is Kṛṣṇa is acting there? Why you say that "commits murder?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa is getting the sin committed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sama-darśinaḥ</span> means you have no distinction what is sin and what is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Sama-darśinaḥ</span> means to treat everyone as equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. <span class="Italic">Sama darśinaḥ</span> means there is no distinction between sin and virtue. That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> As soon as you see, "This is virtue, and this is sin," it is not <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Virtue and sin become the same in <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In other words, the sin does not remain sin any longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But he has no vision that "This is sin, and this is virtue." That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> As soon as you make distinction, you are not <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In another interpretation, in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may interpret in a different. <span class="Italic">Sama-darśi,</span> this is plain word. <span class="Italic">Sama-darśi</span> means there is no difference, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But <span class="Italic">sama-darśi</span> equals <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span> The sin and virtue are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here... Yes, that is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ</span> because here it is said clearly, <span class="Italic">vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇa</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and <span class="Italic">vinaya,</span> very humble... That is the sign of goodness. <span class="Italic">Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne gavi hastini śunica. Śunica</span> means dog. Now he is seeing a dog and a learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa-</span>same. Now, dog is supposed to be sinful, and this learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is supposed to be virtuous. Therefore his vision, the virtuous and the sinful, the same. That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think that they have made a many mistakes in writing of the <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Now you are finding mistake with Vyāsa, so who can talk with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, but, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Please excuse me. Please go out. Please go out. Don't trouble. You are finding faults with Vyāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We only want you to be understood here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (shouting) I am not <span class="Italic">sama-darśi!</span> I don't say I'm <span class="Italic">sama-darśi!</span> I don't say, <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span> So you say <span class="Italic">sama-darśi. Sama-darśi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You should be <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I am not in that stage. I say because you don't surrender to Kṛṣṇa, you are sinful. That is my <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So then you should be also seeing as <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why shall I? I am not in that position. I am not within that... I am simply repeating the words of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Then that... You came to... Even your... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am simply teaching the teachings of Kṛṣṇa. That is my point. I may be <span class="Italic">sama-darśi,</span> I may be not <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Not be, but you teach that we should worship the <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says. I don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Ah! You say, Kṛṣṇa says that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that does not mean that one has become <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> That is... That is his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Then he is not following the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. My position is simply repeating. That's all. My position is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So we want understanding more than mere tape recorder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you may be tape... But that is my position because I have been authorized in that way, that "Anyone who preaches this confidential subject matter, he is My dear." So I have nothing to learn, what is <span class="Italic">sama-darśi.</span> I have my position...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, blind following and open-eyed following, I say it is all right. We can read the book. We can read the verses, translation, Hindi translation. But that is not understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is not understanding, I understand. But I am understanding from my teacher, just like I told you, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Lord Caitanya. There are so many stalwart teachers, practically whole Hindu community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> But every successive teacher has added some interpretations of the knowledge, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all let him be successor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You are the successor of somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes. So you want to act something to get knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> And what is your contribution, then? That is what we are asking. What is <span class="Italic">sama-darśi?</span> Have you become <span class="Italic">sama-darśi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> You are teaching others to be <span class="Italic">sama-darśi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My <span class="Italic">sama-darśi</span> is that why only the Hindus shall know Kṛṣṇa? The world should know Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> World should know also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What exactly Kṛṣṇa was and what is His teachings? That is what... teachings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you... If the Hindus refuse to know, what can I do? If the Hindus refuse to know, then what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> There is no challenge to anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> This is a simple open-hearted discussion that we should have learned something, though we are not in a position to make...(Indians talking together)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But the process of knowing is... Kṛṣṇa says, "Just try to approach a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render him all kinds of service. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth. And when you have thus learned the truth you will know that all living beings are My parts and parcels, that they are in Me and are Mine." So if one is not prepared to approach a spiritual master inquiringly, not challenging, but with inquiry and followed by submission or service... You must be prepared to act on the instructions of the spiritual master. If those two qualifications are not with you, then why approach anyone for anything? You will simply waste his time and your own time. This is Kṛṣṇa speaking in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "You just try to approach a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively. Render him all kinds of service. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> There is a difference of day and night between blind following and his following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That is not blind following. Submissive inquiry and then you have to be prepared to test. Just like the professor, the professor in a college. He says, "You inquire from me." "My dear professor, how is it?" He says, "It is like this. You simply do this homework." And you do it. You have to do it; otherwise you cannot get any mark. You cannot make any advancement in the class. If you simply say, "Oh, why, why, why...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That is submission. That is inquiry and submission, that the master is there and you say, "All right, I accept you as my master and I want to follow your instruction." And then in the end, when you have done the work, then you can say, "Oh, this master, yes, he is correct," or "No, he's a fool."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> You have caught up only one <span class="Italic">śloka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There is no other way. It is not possible. Every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is as good as any other <span class="Italic">śloka</span> because it is absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Let me say, tell you what submissive word means in relation of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, the perfect example given by Arjuna, the perfect disciple, is "Now I am confused about duty..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> ...more than you or I.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Arjuna says to Kṛṣṇa... Arjuna says to Kṛṣṇa... What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. First let me know whether you want to submit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> I do!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all answer this question, whether you want to submit or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> We want to submit after understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Try to understand. The teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins when Arjuna admits, when he admits that "Oh, now I see. Now I am confused about my duty. Now I am a soul surrendered unto You. You please instruct me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> We don't want... We have not come here... (many Indians talking at once)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> If you are not prepared to follow the example of Arjuna and submit yourself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swami Bhaktivedanta has said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> When we are all... (several talking at once)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> One at a time. One at a time. Let me make my point, that <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> begins... The reason <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> has value is because Arjuna, he admits his ignorance. He says, "Now I am confused about my duty and I am a soul surrendered unto You. You please instruct me." That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And if, if we want to take, or if we want to get the benefit of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> then we must follow the example of Arjuna, who is the perfect disciple, and Kṛṣṇa is the perfect master. And the first point is you must become submissive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We understand now what you mean, submissiveness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So that same thing is there if you want to learn from a spiritual master, that you come with an attitude of submission and prepared to follow the instructions. But if you think, "Well, if I like the instruction, I may follow. And if I don't like, then let him go to hell," then what is the use of inquiry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, no, no. We don't want Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is not the idea. Submissiveness is the only lesson of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That is the only lesson. "You just give up all..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we cannot hear any more. That is the only lesson. That is the only example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Give up all forms of religiousness and just surrender unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You are taking one <span class="Italic">śloka...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Any <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> any <span class="Italic">śloka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither you can give up this <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> You cannot give up this <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> Yes. So first of all you answer. See practical example. When Arjuna became confused, he said, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam: [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7] "Now I am surrendered unto You. Please teach me." Unless you come to that point, there will be no teaching and there is no use of teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> What time and what energy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to see. You have to see. You have to see your time, when you are prepared to surrender. When you are prepared to surrender, as Arjuna said that "I am now confused and I surrender unto You." If you think that you are not confused, you cannot surrender, then there is no question of teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Surrender is first condition. "You must surrender" is the first condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
