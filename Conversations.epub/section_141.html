<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Printed in Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Beautiful. It's very industrious. It's marvelous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next book is coming, <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What will that be, your own writings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is the authorized translation of Rūpa Gosvāmī's book, <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Whose...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī, Lord Caitanya's principal disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Uhuh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī. There are six Gosvāmīs, direct disciples of Lord Caitanya. Er, not, six Gosvāmīs and three other confidential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, our... About the six Gosvāmīs, Rūpa Gosvāmī is the principal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Rūpa Gos...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī. He was finance minister in the government of Nawab Hussain Shah in Bengal. But when Lord Caitanya started His movement, he was captivated and he resigned his service, government service and joined Him. And he wrote immense literature, Gosvāmīs. And that Desai was talking that Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, he says, <span class="Italic">rūpa-raghunātha-pade haibe ākuti kabe hāma bujhaba se yugala-pīriti:</span> conjugal love of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, one can understand when they go through the literatures presented by these Gosvāmīs. So his first book is <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span> Devotion of, <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span> That is very authorized book. Quotation from various Vedic literature about Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa and the different stages of relationship with Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa, dāsya-rasa,</span> admiration. God is Great. This is also one stage, appreciating the greatness of God. Then further development, <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa,</span> willing to serve. Oh! God is so great, and I must serve service because everyone of us are serving somebody. So why not serve the Supreme? Nobody is free from service because we are constitutionally the servant. Either we become the servant of the Great or <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like in any condition of our lives, we have to abide by the laws of the state. If he says that we don't abide then come to prisonhouse. You will be forced. Similarly, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and Kṛṣṇa. If we don't abide by Kṛṣṇa, then come to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He cannot be free. That is not our position. Freedom is frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you remember a man named Richard Alpert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you remember of a man named Richard Alpert? He used to work with Timothy Leary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In Harvard many years ago. And then he went to India and found a teacher, and is now a disciple of Hanumānji or a devotee of Hanumān. And he said that, we were talking about <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and the present condition of America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have some fruits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In a while. Well, we can talk as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Accha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Bite your food. I have that question I wanted to asked. Are you tired?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I can talk with you whole night. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So he said that his teacher in India told him that LSD was a Christ of the Kali-yuga for Westerners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> of the Kali-yuga for Westerners in that, as the Kali-yuga got more intense, as attachment got thicker and thicker, that also salvation would have to be easier and easier, and that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> <span class="Italic">Namaste.</span> (to Indian lady)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is a Bengali lady recently come from London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ahh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lekha. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So, as the Kali-yuga became more intense and as attachment became deeper and more confusing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Attachment for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...that salvation would also have to become easier and easier in the Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very nice statement that in the Kali-yuga salvation is very easier. That is the version of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also, but that process is this <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> not LSD.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, it was... The reasoning there, was that for those who would only accept salvation in purely material form, in chemical form finally, and completely material form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. So where is the salvation when there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...that Kṛṣṇa had the humor to emerge as a pill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is that any of these material forms...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...then where it is salvation? It is illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well the subjective effect is to cut...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...attachment during the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if you have got attachments for something material, then where is the cut-off attachment. LSD is a material chemical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you have to take shelter of LSD then you take, I mean to say, help from the matters, so that is... How you can... How you are free from matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, the subjective experience is, while in the state of intoxication of LSD, also realizing that LSD is a material pill, and that it does not really matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is risky. That is risky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah. Now so, if LSD is a material attachment, which it is I think, then is not the sound, <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> also a material attachment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">śabda</span> is spiritual. Originally just like in Bible there is, "Let there be creation." This sound, this spiritual sound. Creation. Creation was not there. The sound produced the creation. Therefore, sound is originally spiritual and through the sound; sound-from sound, sky develops; from sky, air develop; from air, fire develop; fire, water develop; from water, land develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Sound is the first element of creation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What was the first sound, traditionally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic states, <span class="Italic">Oṁ.</span> So at least we can understand from your Bible, that God said, "Let there be creation." So this is sound, and there is creation. God and His sound is non-different, absolute. I say, "Mr. Ginsberg," this sound and I, a little difference, but God is non-different from His energy, <span class="Italic">nitya...</span> How it is called? <span class="Italic">Śakti śaktimator abhedhaḥ. Śakti,</span> energy and <span class="Italic">śakti-mat,</span> the energetic. They are non-different. Just like fire and heat, they are non-different, but heat is not fire. You can not differentiate heat from fire, or fire from heat. But fire is not heat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well the sounds, the sound <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, is non-different from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...is not different from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore, this sound <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Under all circumstances?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, all, all circumstances, but it is the question of my appreciation, or my realization. That will depend on my purity. Otherwise this Kṛṣṇa sound and Kṛṣṇa, non-different. Therefore if we vibrate sound Kṛṣṇa, then I am immediately in contact with Kṛṣṇa, and if Kṛṣṇa is whole spirit, then immediately I become spiritualized. Just like if you touch electricity, immediately you're electrified. And the more you become electrified, more you become Kṛṣṇized. Kṛṣṇized. So when you are fully Kṛṣṇized, then you are in the Kṛṣṇa platform. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> then fully Kṛṣṇized, no more comes back to this material existence. He remains with Kṛṣṇa. The impersonalists shall say merging. That is less intelligence. Merging does not mean losing individuality. Just like a green bird enters a green tree; it appears merging, but the bird has not lost his individuality. There is individuality. Similarly Kṛṣṇa says in the Fourth Chapter, no, Second Chapter that I, you, <span class="Italic">adyam</span>(?), I and all these people who have assembled; it is not that they did not exist previously neither it is that they'll not exist. That means I, you, and all these persons, they were individual in the past. At the present we see it practically, and in future they'll remain individuals. And individually we are that, in our present existence, everyone of us individual. You have got your individual views, I have got my individual views. We agree on common platform, that is different thing, but we are individual. That is our nature. Therefore there is disagreement sometimes. So the individuality is never lost. But our proposition, <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga,</span> is to keep individuality and agree with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> To keep...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And agree with you. Our surrender means we agree with Kṛṣṇa in everything, although we are individual. If Kṛṣṇa says you have to die, we die; out of love. But we are individual, I can deny "Why shall I die?" That reality I have got. Just like Arjuna was asked, "Now I have taught you <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> now whatever you like you do," <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">,</span> "as you like." He doesn't touch the individuality. But Arjuna voluntarily surrendered: "Yes," <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">,</span> "yes, I shall do whatever You ask." He changed his decision. He decided not to fight, but he agreed, "Yes," <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava.</span> This agreement, this is oneness. Not oneness does not mean mix up homogeneously. No, He keeps his individuality. Kṛṣṇa keeps his individuality, <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru:</span> "Now whatever you like you do." He says, "Yes," <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I shall do what you say." So this is oneness. Not to lose individuality. Because we cannot lose our individuality. We are individually made originally. Kṛṣṇa is individual, we are individual, everyone is individual. Merging means merging in that total agreement. That is liberation. Total agreement without any disagreement. And that is the perfection: to keep individuality and agree with God in total agreement. That is perfection. And imperfection so long we are in rebelled condition that is material because one who has a slightest desire of disagreement with Kṛṣṇa, he cannot live there. There the only predominant figure is Kṛṣṇa. So one who is trained fully to agree with Kṛṣṇa, they are accepted as associates. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ pradadyate: [Bg. </span>7.19] after many, many births of cultivating knowledge in spiritual life, a fully conversant, wise person surrenders unto Me. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanaṁ ante:</span> after many, many births. How he surrenders? <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti: [Bg. </span>7.19] oh! Kṛṣṇa is everything. The <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> gives hint, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> what is Brahmā, what is supreme? <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> to inquire about Brahmān, the Supreme. The answer is Brahman is that or He who is the original source of everything. We have to find out who is the original source, so that requires wisdom. So when one is perfectly wise after many, many births, cultured, he sees, "Ah, here is the original, Kṛṣṇa," <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> that <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> great soul, is very rare to be seen, who has surrendered. So our... We are giving the shortcut process: what one has to attain after many, many births, we are simply saying is surrender to Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That's all. This is the greatest boon or, what is called, greatest reward or contribution to the human society. And if actually one is wise, then he'll take our word that if one has to come to this point after many, many births, that Kṛṣṇa is everything, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> to understand, why not accept it immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you take rebirth in human form literally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> As a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I just don't remember having been born before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't remember your childhood that does not mean you had no childhood. Do you remember when you were so small boy, what did you did?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Certain things. Not very small, but there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or when you were in your womb of your mother. Do you remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, does it mean that you are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No, it doesn't mean that I am not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You do not remember, that is not reason. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Prabhupāda:</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because I do not remember what I did in my mother's womb, that does not mean that I had no a little body. The body is change, I am there. Therefore, I change this body I will remain. This is common sense business. I am changing my body daily every moment. Your childhood body and this body is not the same. You have changed your body, but that does not mean you have, you are different person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes, but I have really never seen or heard any, anything but what I see in here now. What I see in here is what I can remember is what I can remember. I don't, I've never heard any reasonable or, or even drawing description of previous incarnations, or previous births.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have never heard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Of, I've never heard anything sensible sounding about it, anything that actually makes me think, "Ah, that must be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not sensible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Not really, no. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Sensible, touchable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, suppose, not suppose, it's a fact: your body in the mother's womb in the first day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of the father, mother sex life, it comes just like the pea many diverse. So from the pea you have come to this point. So body is changing. So what is the astonishment if you change this body, again become, take another pea form. What is the difficulty to understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, the difficulty to understand would be any permanent being; to understand that there is any permanent being or any continuity of any form of consciousness from one body to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have to consult. Therefore you have to take, just like when you can not understand something, we consult some great authority. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Not enough to make me dream of it at night, no. Not enough to make me love it. Words are not enough. That authority is not enough to make me love it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't accept authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Not enough to love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, love, apart from love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Not enough to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Consult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...going to accept authority. It's just that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Consult, consult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I can't even understand an authority that says that I am there when I don't feel myself there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, suppose when you are in some legal trouble, you go to lawyer. You cannot understand. Why do you say you cannot understand? Where you have disease where do you go to a physician. You see? Authority you accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In America we've had a great deal of difficulty with authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No that is, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No, here is a special problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, that is, I mean to say, misunderstanding. Authority we have to. The child has to accept authority. Always ask mother what is this father, what is this...? Why? That is the beginning: ask, ask, ask. That is the way of acquiring knowledge. <span class="Italic">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa...</span> The Vedic injunction is there, if you want to understand that science, you must to go to guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> But do you understand your previous lives from the descriptions in authoritative texts, or from any introspective recollection...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have to corroborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...of your own?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Corroborate. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who could not finish this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he gets birth in two places, either in very rich family, or in a very pure <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, brahminical cultured family. So from my life I experience, when I was very little child six or seven years old, I was very much fond of Kṛṣṇa. And I got the opportunity of this two things. Although my father was not very rich, but he was pure <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava.</span> He was great devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I assume Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta, and accidentally, I was born in a very rich family. You have seen that picture in my Calcutta, dancing. In that, there is a Kashi Mallik's family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Woman:</span> (Bengali) Kashi Malliker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very aristocratic family. I do, I did not belong to that family, but I was born in that family, you see? And from the very beginning the Kashi Mallik, they have got nice Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. So I was standing before the deity, and I was seeing, "Oh, He is Kṛṣṇa. Oh, people say He is dead. How he is dead?" Like that I was thinking. And then my, I asked my father, "Oh, I shall worship Kṛṣṇa, give me." So my father gave me Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, so I, whatever I was eating, I was offering them. So the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and my practical experience corroborates. So we we have to take instance like that, you see? <span class="Italic">Sādhu śāstra guru vākya.</span> We have to test everything from three positions: the spiritual master, scripture, and holy man. Scripture means, just like Bible. What is Bible? Scripture. Why the scripture? It is fully contains the instruction of <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> holy man, or spiritual master, Lord Jesus Christ, therefore is scripture. The scripture means the statement of liberated holy man. That is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> Therefore, scripture should be tested through the holy man and spiritual master. Spiritual master should be tested through scripture and holy man, and holy man should be tested through spiritual master and scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What is the difference between holy man and spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No difference, but one has to test whether he is holy man. Then you have to, he has to corroborate with the statement of the scripture. Spiritual master is to be tested whether he is holy man, and whether there is corroboration in the statement of the scriptures. <span class="Italic">Sādhu śāstra guru vākya tinete koriya aikya.</span> Just like the law court, the experienced lawyer's speaking and giving evidence. <span class="Italic">Sādhu-śāstra,</span> and the judge is giving judgement, "Here is a statement, here is this lawbook." He has (indistinct). He also testing, the judge is also testing how the lawyer is speaking, and how it is corroborates to the lawbook. So similarly everything has to be tested in that way. The scripture should be consulted, and we should have to see whether it is corroborated. So we should not accept any man as spiritual master or holy man if he does not corroborate with the statement of the scripture. So we should not accept any man as spiritual master or holy man if he does not corroborate with the statement of the scripture. He's at once rejected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> How shall we sing tomorrow. Have you thought of an arrangement of the program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> As you like. At what time are we supposed to do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In the hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Is there a stage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The stage has a..., there's a seat, there's a floor, and there's gradually little steps about six, seven steps and then the stage, where the platform, so on the steps people can sit also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes, the more the merrier. So how long will we go? Did you figure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Well, when, we have the auditorium till...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> How long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> At least two and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Okay, let's go through the whole two and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Good, good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, how do you feeling about chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I have been chanting steadily all along now although I enjoy it more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Lately, Peter and I have been chanting together on stages, and lately we have been singing <span class="Italic">Rāghupati Rāghava Rājarāma.</span> Is that part of your canon also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no harm, but this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is recommended in the scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The Hare Kṛṣṇa is the most pleasing of the chanting as far as I am concerned. Do we want to do that continuously, for as a complete?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you want to do that continuously or do you want any other like <span class="Italic">Gopāla</span> or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> should be chanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You see, we have two and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It'll be lecturing too though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in the beginning we should have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And at the end we should have <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> And in the middle we can speak, you can speak about Kṛṣṇa Conciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think you'd better speak because you're more eloquent on it and also you understand in the language...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll speak and you'll also speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You might not like what I say. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No you say your experience, how you're experiencing. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ.</span> You have got Kṛṣṇa's blessings upon you. You are not ordinary man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I'm not certain that I'm worthy of that, Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But I know that you are not ordinary man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well... I've only recently stopped smoking, by the way, finally. With that car crash, I quit smoking. But I haven't stopped eating meat. So what is the intelligence of meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You remain with us at least for three months and you'll forget your... You remain with us for three months. (laughter) With your associates, you just come to Vṛndāvana. We shall live together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You have a farm now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You have a farm now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And you'll forget everything. You'll be fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> We have a farm also now in upstate New York. There we have vegetarian table also in the farm. We have a cow, goats. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From economic point of view, if one man has got a cow and four acres of land, he has no economic problem. That we want to start. He can independently live any part of the world. Simply he must (have) one cow and four acres of land. Let the people be divided with four acres of land and a cow, there will be no economic question. All the factories will be closed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Four acres, you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am instructing Kīrtanānanda, to show this example in New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Are you going to be able to do it on four acres?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I hope so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it very difficult? Four acres of land per head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I just this last night was in Minnesota, which is flat, very fertile, very rich land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is? Which province?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Minnesota. Midwest. Further west. Talking with a poet who also is a fellow <span class="Italic">sādhana,</span> whose family is from that area for many generations, whose brother has a thousand acres of land, and he himself has 160 acres of land. And as farming is done now in America, apparently 160 acres is not enough to support a farm economically because farming is done now in such large scale with machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You can use those machines if you want. If you want to live in the so-called American style, that is so. But if you're willing to adopt the Vedic way of minimizing the material needs in order to pursue Kṛṣṇa consciousness, what does one need? He needs sufficient food to keep the body healthy and a place to lay down. So four acres is plenty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Where do you get the... How do you feed the cow, or would you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> On four acres you can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You can get enough hay for a cow, for...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fodder. Yes. We grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> On food, it depends on what part of the east?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> He's a farmer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Whereabouts? What part? Cause a cow has to have about three acres for grazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> So at most five acres. It's in that vicinity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> See we are interested in this problem of minimizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us cooperate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And doing organic farming and minimizing the effort and also the material demands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You can grow sufficient vegetables on a fraction of an acre.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. We had a big vegetable garden this year, too. I've been doing farming... Peter has been doing a great deal of farming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> How are you tilling your land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We have a friend who comes out with a plow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You're doing it by hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We just got a horse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We just got a horse. We had bad experience with a rotary tiller. We got rid of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> West Virginia. We gave it away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So we're also going through a coovy(?) <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> for poets. A little farm for poets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Farming, agriculture, that is nice. There is a proverb: agriculture is the noblest profession. Is it not said? Agriculture is noblest, and Kṛṣṇa was farmer, His father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cow, yes. And in Vedic literature you'll find, a man is... Richness of a man is estimated by the possession of grains and cows. <span class="Italic">Dhanyena dhanavān.</span> If he has got sufficient quantity grain, then he's to be... Formerly, even still in India, when a daughter is offered to a family, they will go and see how many <span class="Italic">morais</span>(?) there are. Grain stock. If he sees that he has five, six, big, big grain stock, then he can... "Oh, this is nice house." You see? "They can feed." So in India still, the arrangement is that every family has got at least two years grain in stock. You see? And cow at least one dozen. No economic problem. And actually, that is the fact. You keep cows and have sufficient grains, whole economic problem solved. Eating. And sleeping, you can take some wood and four pillars. Of course, in your country it is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very cold. (laughing) India, all the year they are lying on the flat sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But still, it is very simple. We also experimented with that. You can build a nice shelter very... for ten, fifteen dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, it depends. You see, where we are we're twenty below.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Well, we have pretty near that in West Virginia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In Minnesota gets thirty, forty, sometimes, below.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> There has to have sufficient wood sawed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly, in Europe they were also living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Man lived this way for 20,000 years, 30,000 years until the 19th Century.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to live that. Plain living, high thinking. The necessities of this bodily existence, that should be minimized and not unhealthy. Healthy. To keep oneself fit. But the time should be utilized-develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness, spiritual life. Then his whole problem is solved. Here is the big man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Young devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many rounds you chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> All rounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only one round?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> All round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> All the way round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> All the rounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the rounds? Oh, very nice. He's Mr. Dhari(?). Oh, you did not return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> (introducing:) Mr. Ginsberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I'm saluting you like that. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> He's so good, because he was so good last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Children very easily adopt it. So this is the perfect yoga system. No artificial education. Spontaneous response, dancing, Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. This is the easiest method. So the greatest contribution to the human society. Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, so tomorrow we'll be doing it. So now, the next question I had in my mind is we'll be doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> then language, speech. Then end with <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana. Kīrtana</span> means <span class="Italic">kīrtayati.</span> Glorifying. That is <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> So either you sing musically or you speak devotionally, both of them are <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Just like Śukadeva Gosvāmī, he continually spoke to Mahārāja Parīkṣit. That is also state, <span class="Italic">śrī viṣṇu... śravaṇe parīkṣit, abhavad vaiyāsakiḥ kīrtane.</span> Vaiyasaki, the son of Vyāsadeva, Sukadeva Gosvāmī, he became liberated simply by <span class="Italic">kīrtane.</span> But what is that <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span> He never played musical way. He simply explained <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So this is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana. Bahubhir militvā kīrtayati.</span> That is <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The chanting is <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting, yes. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, if we have two and one half hours...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We have as long as we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> How long a <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> to begin with, do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> The first one would last, what thirty minutes? Forty minutes? Thirty, forty minutes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Forty, forty-five. At least, half an hour beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Okay. At least half an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last also, half an hour. One hour. And? You have got time? Two hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Oh, as long as you want. Nobody's going to be using that auditorium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then make it one hour speaking and one hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Or one half hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> one hour speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> At least an hour of <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> I don't know how long we will keep a big audience there. That is to say, after the first hour they might start milling out. But if we keep half an audience, that would be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah, well, half will stay. Then the other thing is what tune to use in the <span class="Italic">kīrtanas?</span> I use several tunes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That as you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I would like to begin with the one I've been using. Is that all right? Or do you want to end with that? Or whatever we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> How can we get the people to join in? That's a big thing. We'd like to have the audience to join us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's an audience seated out there, huh? Let me see. How many devotees will be there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Onstage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Everyone here. More from Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What I think might be a good idea is, would it be possible to have the devotees start on the stage, and then if it looks like the audience is not singing vivaciously enough, have the devotees go out and sing... Walk up and down singing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the audience joins, that will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. Do you have a picture of the words written out for the audience? 'Cause if they've got that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Yes, we have that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The question I'm asking basically is, one question I'm asking is, would it be all right to use the tune I've been using at one point or another?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Well, tomorrow night, if we can practice together, we can play together some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We have four drums, cymbals, and a <span class="Italic">taṁburā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We can use yours and we can use ours. When we chant, it's easier for a large group to follow. It's very simple. First, we sing a couple of melodies. Then we can practice in a little while and see which one is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> I think once they get into the chanting, your melody might be a little difficult for them to follow. I'm not sure. Because it varies. There's variation there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The problem, though, is that I've never been able to swing with it before. That's why I haven't used it. So what I would suggest is... Okay. We'll practice it tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We can swing, I'm sure we can swing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. But whatever we do, we got to swing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> That's for sure. But there've been... See what you think of various melodies. We play various melodies and see how we can come out. Another thing, do you want to have responsive chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Responsive chanting must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> That would be interesting, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise everyone will become tired and that will be chaotic. Response. That's nice. Then the audience will respond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> We got into some responsive chanting last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Why don't you lead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? I can lead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> That's a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can lead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> That's a groovy idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> I think what we'll do is you lead the first chant, and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others will respond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> And then Mr. Ginsberg can talk a little of his experiences, and then you talk. And then Mr. Ginsberg lead the second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Because Prabhupāda will be speaking for an hour, maybe Hayagrīva you can lead the first chant. You have a very nice voice too. Because he'll be speaking for an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is time he will also speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Well, if he can lead the first I think that would be... The students would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. If he leads the first, will they be able to have responsive chanting too? Do you want responsive chanting when you lead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Oh yes. You'll lead, then we'll respond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If every one of our devotee will respond, naturally the audience also will respond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We'll have a microphone to make it easier for the audience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you also one of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So there is nice microphone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> There will be one, two, three, four, five microphones on stage. And I have one for around your neck, one for around your neck, and if you don't like that, there are stands. But the stands can be down here, can be up here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Can Peter get near one too? Can Peter get near a microphone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Okay. Well, that's a very good program then. What instrument, stage instruments, do you have? Do you have a harmonium?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> They're from Buffalo. Oh, we have... We have two harmoniums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think we have our harmonium also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We have three harmoniums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Same pitch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> We'll have to check that tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. Let's check the pitch of the harmoniums tomorrow. I've been learning to write music. My <span class="Italic">kavi</span> guru was a poet named William Blake. Do you know Blake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes, yes, I have heard his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So I've been writing music. He's a lot like Kabir. Yes. Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji and Bankibehari in Vṛndāvana. Do you know them at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīmataji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji in Vṛndāvana, is a lady in Vṛndāvana who translates Kabir into English, compared him with Blake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, she is different. I know one Mātājī. She came to see me from Vṛndāvana in Los Angeles. She's in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So I have been learning to notate music, in..., singing songs by William Blake which I've written a little music to. So those are, in a way, my guru's songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can give you so many songs. (laughter) Just like he can read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Are there many songs in there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not there. There is diacritic mark. Can you read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No. I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, <span class="Italic">Nitāi-pada...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Who wrote this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, a great poet and devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> You've been writing many in... A beautiful notebook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, I was supplied this dummy book, without printing. So I'm using it as notebook. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Would you like to hear one of the Blake songs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blake song?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> (to Peter) Do you want to sing "Tears Up"? (singing:)</div>
<div class="Center">Whate'er is born of mortal birth<br class="calibre2"/>Must be consumed with the earth,<br class="calibre2"/>To rise from generations free,<br class="calibre2"/>Then why have I to do with thee?</div>
<div class="Center">The sexes sprung from shame and pride,<br class="calibre2"/>Blow in the morn, in the evening die,<br class="calibre2"/>But mercy change death into sleep<br class="calibre2"/>The sexes rose to walk and weep.</div>
<div class="Center">The mother of my mortal part<br class="calibre2"/>With cruelty did'st mould my heart,<br class="calibre2"/>And with false self-deceiving tears,<br class="calibre2"/>Did'st bind my nostrils, eyes and ears</div>
<div class="Center">Did'st close my tongue in senseless clay<br class="calibre2"/>And be to mortal life betrayed.<br class="calibre2"/>The death of Jesus set me free<br class="calibre2"/>Then what have I to do with thee.</div>
<div class="Center">It is raised, a spiritual body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He believes in spiritual body. That's nice. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's a,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> ...it's Blake's version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to Hayagrīva) I think you wrote one article about this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Enlight... I think in one of the Kṛṣṇa Consciousness poetry, I mentioned Blake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes, he apparently fits into, in the West what is called the Gnostic tradition, which has similar ideas and similar <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> attitudes to the Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Similar cosmography, cosmology. He was my teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not give much stress on this material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No! At the end of his life, he didn't count on the material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, there is a spiritual concept of life in his poetry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Blake died on chanting. I don't know what he was chanting but he died singing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> He died singing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> He died singing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What of Blake's would in fit in, I wonder? "The Lamb?" "The Lamb" would fit. Oh, "The Chimneysweeper," yes, "The Chimneysweeper." (to Peter) Do you want to try that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chimney sweeper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's a song by Blake: "When my..." (to Peter) Do you need the words or, you can follow it without the words, yeah:</div>
<div class="Center">When my mother died I was very young<br class="calibre2"/>And my father sold me while yet my tongue<br class="calibre2"/>Could scarcely cry, weep, weep, weep, weep.<br class="calibre2"/>So your chimneys I sweep and in soot I sleep.</div>
<div class="Center">There's little Tom Dockreb who dark cried when his head<br class="calibre2"/>That curled like a lamb's back were shaved, so I said,<br class="calibre2"/>"Hush Tom, never mind it for when your head's bare,<br class="calibre2"/>You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."</div>
<div class="Center">And so he was quiet and that very night<br class="calibre2"/>As Tom was asleeping he has such a sigh<br class="calibre2"/>That thousands of sweepers Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack<br class="calibre2"/>Were all of them locked in coffins of black</div>
<div class="Center">And by came an angel who had a bright key<br class="calibre2"/>And he opened the coffins and set them all free,<br class="calibre2"/>Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they ran<br class="calibre2"/>And wash in a river and shine in the sun.</div>
<div class="Center">Then naked and wiped, all their bags left behind<br class="calibre2"/>They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind<br class="calibre2"/>And the angel told Tom if he be a good boy<br class="calibre2"/>He'd have God for his father and never want joy.</div>
<div class="Center">And so Tom awoke and we rose in the dark<br class="calibre2"/>And God with our bags and our brushes to work<br class="calibre2"/>Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm<br class="calibre2"/>So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Did you understand the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well it's... The chimneysweeper is the little boy who has to go into a chimney to sweep out the soot. And the man who hired the chimneysweeper cut off all his hair, and he had beautiful hair, so his friend told him, "Never mind because when your hair is gone you know that the soot cannot spoil your pretty white hair." So if you have no hair you don't have to worry what will happen to your hair, which is a very <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava</span> doctrine also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Excuse me, Prabhupāda, it's five to eleven now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ok. We'd better let everybody retire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Here, there's a little bit of food coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Oh, it's a Gnostic doctrine, if it's not <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come on. You come, Mr. Ginsberg, take. First of all, you take. You take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I have something. (end)</div>
