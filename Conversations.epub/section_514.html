<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Any place where there is no sunshine, that is condemned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In your <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you write that the sun purifies a dirty place and also the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But we don't rely on the sun for purifying our mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> As devotees, we don't rely on the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have the Kṛṣṇa sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this, sun? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Spinnery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spinnery. [break] There is no sunshine. It is wet always, just see? Trees also, they have moss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In India the sun is very intense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Does that have something to do that Kṛṣṇa appeared there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puṇya-bhūmi,</span> pious land. Still, so fallen, whenever there is a question of spiritual meeting, thousands, <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> will come. You have seen Kumbha-melā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I've seen pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very poor men, still, they gather, sixty <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> without any advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Here you have to advertise to get six hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it was so nice to live there, spiritual atmosphere, on the bank of the Ganges and Yamunā. Immediately you go, you become spiritualized. Vṛndāvana is also like that. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite janma haila, manuṣya-janma haila.</span> To get the human form of life born in India, that is a special prerogative. <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhumite manuṣya-janma haila yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is fifty percent-prepared by birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just by birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And then, by culture, another fifty percent. But they have given up this culture. But the birthright fifty percent is already also there. Prayāga, severest cold, eh, I took bath in the Ganges. It is simply cutting. But still, they are taking bath and smearing over the body the ashes and sit down, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. No care "Wherefrom food will come? Where...?" No. That's in India still. [break] ...it is also like this, cloudy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Just a few months out of the year, January, February.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise how we have gone there? (laughter) Africa was part of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The land was together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Geological information it was. It was together. And Australia was fitting in the Bay of Bengal. This is the theory. I learned from my lecturer, Dr. Willinghurst. He told me in my class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> we understand that the black man who was born out of the body of King Vena, he was thief. So he was sent to the African jungle. Yes. And they are still thief. (laughter) They cannot give up their... Although they have got independence, they cannot give up this habit. (Dog barking) "Best friend."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Mahārāja Pṛthu also came from the body of King Vena.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So he stayed in India, and the other, he went to Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was the emperor of the whole world. But the jungle part... Somebody... The whole world was known as Bhāratavarṣa, this planet, nine <span class="Italic">varṣas:</span> Bhārata-varṣa, Ketumāla-varṣa, Ilāvṛta-varṣa... the whole universal situation is mentioned, where different lands are there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...ages, Śrīla Prabhupāda, did the people, in order to get valuable minerals and gold and things like that, did they mine underneath the ground?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There was no need of coal. And the jewelries and stones were received from the sea-pearls, valuable stones from the hills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they didn't dig deep holes underneath the ground?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There was no need. The richest persons' property were ivory, gold, marble, valuable jewels, pearls, silk. This was luxury, not plastic. Now they have advanced, they have got plastic, no gold, no silver. Paper money and plastic utensils. This is advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Do we consider ivory as something pure or impure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It is pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ivory, yes. There is a current proverb, "Dead elephant, one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees." <span class="Italic">Mara hati lakṣa na:</span>(?) "Elephant, alive or dead, one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees." On account of ivory. When the elephant is dead, it is put into a hole and covered. And after sometimes you find all the ivory. The bones and the teeth are very, very valuable. Formerly big, big kings, they used to manufacture their furniture of ivory and gold and silk pad. This is luxury. And the rooms bedecked with jewel. No electricity, no lamp. This is description of Kṛṣṇa's sixteen thousand palace. Who has got now? Sixteen thousand wives and sixteen thousand palace of marble and furniture ivory and gold. Where is there now? Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the richest. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Were all the races originated in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The races were originated in India, all the races, the different races that there are now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India what do you mean by? Not the modern India. India was the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So all the different kinds of human beings actually were originated there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya.</span> First, second, third. Then fourth is the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> And the fifth, <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas:</span> no Vedic culture. They are <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> So the Europeans, they were <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> originally. On account of Paraśurāma's massacre process, they fled from India to European side. And Greece and Rome, they were given-I think, Turkey also-given to two sons of Mahārāja Yayāti. They refused the order of the father. The father was very licentious. So he begged from two sons that "You give me your youth." They refused. So therefore they were banished in this part of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Into England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not England. Greece, Rome, Turkey. Next to India, they were civilized. So European race mostly come from that part. Caucasian. Kaśyapa Muni. Central India. Er, central... What is called? Asia, Asia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why it took Paraśurāma twenty-one times to defeat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were not properly doing their duties. So Paraśurāma said, "I will kill all of them." Formerly <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> were guided by the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> even Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, all the rules and regulations. But the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> were the legislative assembly. And <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> were the executive, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> productive, and <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> worker. At the present moment there is no director, neither executive. Some of them are only productive, and some of them are worker, most of them. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdraḥ-sambhavaḥ.</span> In the Kali-yuga, mostly all the people are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Because they are workers. [break] Everyone can be purified, even the <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas. Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">. Yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ. Yavanas</span> means these European groups, and <span class="Italic">khasādayaḥ,</span> Mongolian group: China, Japan. So Japanese were there in Vedic age also. Kālayavana. Kālayavana fought with Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (devotees laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He was recording like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, just the last few minutes. (laughter) I was listening though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, will the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will take over the world eventually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Is going to take over the world eventually some time during the Kali-yuga, in this Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible, because only the fortunate persons will take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I mean, but will the power of the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> will be in the hands of the Kṛṣṇa conscious persons sometime during this Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Provided you become very expert to preach. Unless you preach, how they will take? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Towards the end of the Kali-yuga isn't there a description in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> that one will not be able to see the sun or the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> During the end of Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Because of the impiety. So there will be no vegetation. Is that description in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think. [break] ...it is stated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I had heard-of course, I'm not certain of the source-that because of impiety the sun and the moon, people would not be able to see. So there would be no vegetation. And without vegetation, even animals cannot live. So eventually they would take to eating their own children. Is this what takes place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there will be no foodstuff at the end of... That is stated. No milk, no food grains, no fruits, no whatever. Especially food grains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There will be some devotees left at the end of Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, only the devotees will be left. All others... [break] (loud noise of car screeching.) ...are not very neat and clean. (chuckles) Yes. That means condition is not very good. And it is sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Not in proper repair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We had an engagement last night at a technical school after your lecture, and inside the entrance of the technical school in a big glass case they had a big engine from a car, when you walk into the technical school. Mostly Indians, young boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. [break] So they were very disrespectful actually. But when we started <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> the whole atmosphere changed. Do you think that the young Indian boys in the future, they will become anywhere near as pious as their parents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you take India? We are talking of the whole world. There is no question of India, Europe, America. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">...Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> about the <span class="Italic">kirātas</span> and so on. That means we can go to any community in the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...and preach, and some will join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is actually happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda, has there been an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa outside India, somewhere else in another part of the world? Or does He always comes in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śaktyāveṣa avatāra,</span> somebody empowered by Him, not Kṛṣṇa Himself. Just like Christ. Christ is also empowered incarnation. <span class="Italic">Śaktyāveṣa avatāra.</span> Mohammed is also. Anyone who is preaching about God is empowered incarnation. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-śakti vinā nāhi kṛṣṇa nāma-pracāra.</span> That is there in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...that your initiated disciples had some relationship with Lord Caitanya when He was on this earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has relationship, all living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He is Viśvambhara, means the maintainer of all living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Prince of Wales. Prince of Wales, I think this, I think he is dead now. King Edward, I mean to say, George's elder brother? No, not George's. George VI. Is there an elder brother? Edward? When he was Prince of Wales he was actually to be the emperor, or King of England. But he married one common girl, and therefore he was refused. So he, as Prince of Wales, he went to India. And when he saw the bright sunshine, he was surprised. (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He had never seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He, or before him, another prince. Because that Prince of... We were at that time children. So I think King George V, when he was Prince of Wales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, when he came to Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have seen. We were school children at that time. So on the two sides of the road, our first place was, the king, queen passed, we saw. We were given a flag. (laughter) <span class="Italic">"Jaya</span> Rāja, Rājeśvara." We were... And very good tiffin was supplied. Two <span class="Italic">samosa,</span> two <span class="Italic">kachori,</span> two <span class="Italic">sandeśa,</span> and one big tangerine. Twice I saw. Once when he entered Calcutta, and again, one day, when there was a parade of military... military parade. So both days we were invited, and we saw the king. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...Calcutta, on the Maidan, there's that big building, that big memorial. Is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Victoria Memorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That was built for, the king when he was coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that was built in memory of Victoria. It was done, imitating the Taj Mahal. It took twenty years. Sir Rajendranath Mukherjee of Martin Company, he took the contract. And after finishing, he got this title, "Sir." And when it was being constructed, I went to the top by crossing the scaffolding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So you must have been very brave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am still brave. (laughter) Otherwise how could I come alone to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness? I am still brave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some astrologer told that "This boy, for executing his purpose, he will enter into the fire." Yes. [break] ...recently, in our Bombay affair, it was fight with the fire. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have come out victorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much obstacle, still going on. Now the governor is cornered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The governor of Maharastra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Bombay. If he says yes, that is also dangerous; if he says no, that is also dangerous. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We do not really understand how demoniac, how calculating, our leaders are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We have the impression, because we are taught from the very beginning in the schools, that the leaders are to be worshiped, that their birthdays are to be celebrated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He's going to pick up that lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It is difficult to come to that understanding, that actually, those who are the leaders are not to be trusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, leaders means government men. That is described. They are all thieves and rogues, anywhere. <span class="Italic">Dasyu-dharmabhiḥ. Dasyu. Dasyu</span> means plunderers, rogues. Unless you become a rogue you cannot go to the government. You cannot... Any honest man cannot stay with these government men. That is not possible at the present age. Any government. Unless... Just like first-class rogue, your Nixon, he became the president. Because he was a first-class rogue, he became the president. So unless you are first-class rogue, you cannot stay within the circle of government men. <span class="Italic">Rājanya dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.</span> And their business will be to eat up the vital force of the people. <span class="Italic">Bhakṣayiṣyanti prajā sarve rājanya dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.</span> This is the statement. And people will be harassed. On account of their godlessness, they will be harassed by three things: famine, no rain, and taxation. Taxation by the government, and there will be no rain, there will be famine, no food, and they will be so much embarrassed that they will give up their family and go away, <span class="Italic">gacchanti giri-kananam,</span> will go, enter into the hills and forest, giving up their hearth and home. This is Kali-yuga. And this is due to their godlessness. On account of this, then the democracy, means anyone, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> anyone who becomes powerful, he will capture the government post. So the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they are now powerful. <span class="Italic">Śūdras.</span> Industry means <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So they will capture the governmental power. Just like Communist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Even if we present a Kṛṣṇa conscious candidate, the people will still choose a rogue to lead them, even if we present a candidate who is Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Canada we have got already temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Candidate, someone to stand for the election.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do anything. Unless you turn the mass of people Kṛṣṇa conscious, what you will do there? Suppose one man is elected. All demons. What he will do there? Therefore the first thing is that turn the people Kṛṣṇa conscious, and when they will vote, that is shortened (certain?) Otherwise, it is waste of time. (end)</div>
