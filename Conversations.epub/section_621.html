<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 9, 1975, Chicago</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that requires complete overhauling. This religion, that religion will not help. They have no idea what is spiritual knowledge. Everyone is hovering on the mental plane. [break] ...the principle of Ba'hai religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It was founded in Persia. It's a hodge-podge principle. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They think that everyone is evolving, that after taking this human life, you have to go to heaven. That's the next stage, even if you're the most sinful of all sinners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Even one is sinful, he will also go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. Because they say that God is all-merciful, therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> God becomes the order-supplier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They have a big temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Ba'hai temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, no, it's back the other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's much bigger than this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, it's quite a..., very nice. [break] (walking:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">...buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke.</span> So long one is in the bodily concept of life, he is animal. Will these people accept this? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They won't like to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By our preaching we have to make them accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> We have to set an example for them to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the example?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> That this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, actually it does work, it does make us purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No. It works with you. It doesn't work with me," he will say. You have to prove that they are animals. How you will prove it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By showing the activities of the animals and their activities to be the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have to judge that "What is the difference between animal's activities and our so-called civilized man's activities?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> When you compare them to the animals, then they become insulted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he is animal. That is, if you call a thief a thief, he will feel insulted. But does it mean that I shall say that "You are very honest?" A thief shall be called thief. That is natural. If you call a Negro, "You black," he will be angry. But he is black. So... So that is another thing. When the activities are similar to the animal activities, then he is animal. Why a reasonable man will not accept that, hm? In that case also, he is animal. Because they say, "Man is rational animal." So if you are devoid of rationality then again you are animal. So how he will avoid, that he is not animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Many people today are willing to accept that. They say, "Yes, we're animals. We should enjoy our animal nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so go on enjoying. Then don't talk of this "How, what to do, criminal?" Go on, animal. Then why you are anxious to avoid criminality? Hmm? The dogs, hogs, they are not anxious to avoid criminality. Why you are trying to avoid criminality? Remain animal. When the dog goes left to the right, it is not criminality, but why do you prosecute a man when he drives from the left to the right? You remain dog. "Why you charge me criminality? I am dog, sir." Tell him. (laughter) Go to the court and say, "I am dog, sir. Excuse me, I am dog." Why don't you say that? Do you say like that? When you are arrested and charged in the court, you can plead, "I am dog, sir. Excuse me." Why it is not excused? He is punished, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The human body means you have responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they say, "Whatever you do, it is all right." In the human body you cannot do like that. If in the ordinary court it is so strict, so what will be in the court of the God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Just like they have laws, so similarly, Kṛṣṇa has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, laws come... Wherefrom the laws come? It comes from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Janmādyasya yataḥ.</span> Everything, whatever you see, it has come from God. Otherwise where you get the idea? That is the definition in the Vedānta. Whatever you have experienced, that is coming from God, original idea from God. <span class="Italic">Janmādyasya yataḥ.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the same thing is said, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whatever you see, you perceive, you experience, the original is from Kṛṣṇa. (pause) So we shall go? [break] ...them directly that "You are animal." And let him go to the court and we shall prove that he is animal. [break] ...them he is in bodily concept of life, charge him that "You are animal. If you think it is defamation, let us go to the court." [break] ...these isms, nationalism, Communism, socialism, this ism, these are all animalism, nothing but animalism. [break] ...big fish within the water, they are also eating the small fish, and these persons are engaged, the same business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like a big fish, bigger fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big fish is expert. He can go within the water and eat. He has to make some tackle. He is less than fish. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> After catching, he eats it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the fish immediately. He has to cook, he has to..., another thing. That means it is not his food. Artificially, he is eating. [break] ...has taken this photograph?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, she did yesterday. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...why do some of them carry these sticks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sticks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> <span class="Italic">Daṇḍa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To drive away dogs. (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The 400,000 different species of human life? There's one place in which you mention that different persons like carpenter or different tradesmen are different species. Is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What's the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is division. <span class="Italic">Varṇa,</span> that is called <span class="Italic">varṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So that has nothing to do with species. Species is like Negro or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...gods are also included in this human species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different types of... Kinnara, 400,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Also different planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But everyone can become devotee. There is no harm. It is not that because one is in the lower species, he cannot become a devotee. Everyone can become a devotee. [break] <span class="Italic">...yoni,</span> they can also become perfect devotee. [break] This is the power of God. He can deliver anyone without any consideration. Therefore <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ,</span> he does not make these divisions. He sees that "He is spirit soul. So let him be delivered." That's all. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśināh [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Materially there is division. He is black, he is white, he is this, he is that. This is material. Spiritually, there is no division. One. [break] They make, what is called, spiritual division also. That is their foolishness. Spiritually there is no division. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">. Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>

<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 9, 1975, Chicago</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car:) ...sex, up to the point of death. [break] ...in his belt was urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, he got his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> F.D.R.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He was paralyzed also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yeah, he could not walk. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...disease, heart failure, these are the modern disease. People... Cancer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You were also saying that the psychology of the abortion is that the parents do not want to take the trouble...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. Of raising the child. Therefore they create some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, what is the reason? They know there are so many troubles. To avoid the troubles, "Kill this." That's all. So to save trouble, people are prepared to kill child even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And that's considered advancement, in modern life, to remove trouble. The whole life is conveniences, remove trouble. That shows they will go to any extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So trouble that is, <span class="Italic">atyantika-duḥkha-nivṛtti,</span> how to mitigate or finish all trouble, that they do not know. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> So long you will get this body, you will have trouble. But that they do not know, how to stop getting another body. So trouble is not mitigated in that way. You increase your entanglement, become sinful. You again take another body to suffer this sinful reaction. (end)</div>
