<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...scientists can change it? Nature. Nature. Nature should be one kind. Why there are two kinds, varieties? [break] ...migration of the soul is clearly understood or not? Explain how the transmigration takes place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāram... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> but you explain how it takes place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We get a body according to our desires, and then the body only lasts so long, and when it wears out, we have to take another body, and that is determined by our actions in this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But how you transmigrate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> According to the mental condition at the time of leaving this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The subtle body carries the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the main point. The subtle body carries the soul. Just like in dream, we are carried by the subtle body and placed in different condition. But so long this body is capable of working, I come to this body. My dream is over, and I come back to this body. And death means that this body, being useless, instead of coming to this body, I go to another body. This is transmigration. Just like when you vacate an apartment, then you do not come back in that apartment, but you enter another apartment. Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anybody can understand. I am coming, going, but when it is a question of vacating, I go out of the apartment, but I never come back again. I will enter another apartment. "The soul enters another body" means enters the womb of another mother. And there the suitable body is created and again mother delivers the child. Again new chapter of life begins. Where is the difficulty to understand? But they are so rascal and dull-headed, the simple thing they cannot understand. And still, they are big, big scientists, philosophers, and cheating others. They are unable to understand, themselves, and the same rascal knowledge they are distributing to others and taking Nobel Prize. This is the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> the society of the cheaters and the cheated. Where is the difficulty to understand the simple thing, how the soul is transmigrating? They sometimes say that "We do not see how it is going." No, how...? Can you see the mind? But can you deny, "There is no mind?" Mind is there. Everyone knows I have got mind, you have got mind, but do I see your mind? Therefore I shall deny the existence of mind? Mind, intelligence and ego-these three things are there, but we cannot see. How my mind is working, can you see? Or how your mind is working, can I see? And because I cannot see, therefore shall I conclude that you have no mind, I have no mind? How foolish they are. Just see. What is their explanation, Satsvarūpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I was just thinking of a different argument of theirs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That is that sometimes people say, "I don't mind this transmigration if I become a cat or a dog because if I forget so completely, it doesn't matter. I won't even suffer."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it doesn't matter, but if I say that "I will turn you immediately into a dog," will you agree to become?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? You'll forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Fearful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I say that "I can turn you immediately to become a dog..." That is possible, but will you agree to become a dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? You will forget. That is foolishness. "Because I shall forget, therefore I don't care for it"-this is childish, foolish proposal. If I say, "I will turn you immediately to this grass, and you will stay here for one hundred years," will you agree to stand like that for hundred years? Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the western countries actually there is no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> When this is explained to them, they usually, if they are a little intelligent, can understand, but they don't want to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference. And therefore they are rascals. No intelligence. Intelligence is there, but it is so covered that it is almost like trees. Trees are also intelligent because it is life. There is intelligence. You will see one tree is growing. If there is wall, it will grow like this. Have you seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence. And it is proved by science. Dr. Jagadisha Candra Bose, in Calcutta, he has got institute. A machine records how a tree feeling. You cut one tree. How it is feeling pain, that is recorded in the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They also hear sound. They made some experiment that when they grow plants with music, they grow more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In greenhouses. They play music. Then they become more healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Their sensation is very covered. Just like you cut the nails. There is no sensation. And does it mean there is no sensation-therefore there is no life? Unless there is life, how it is growing? It is growing; therefore you cut. But when you cut, there is no sensation. But there is life. Otherwise, how it is growing? The same nail, when you cut, you throw it on the ground. It will not grow. These are practical example. Just like little child. Their sensation is less. I know. My eldest daughter, when she was six months old, there was some boil. So the doctor operated. She simply, "Uh, uh," no cried. I have seen it. She was not crying. But the same boil, when a fully developed man, he will feel more sensation. So according to the body, the sensations are different. The same things, means mind, intelligence and ego, according to the body, they act differently. But the mind, intelligence and ego are there. The dog is coming, and if I say, "Hut!", unless it has got intelligence, how it goes away the other way? There is intelligence. There is no language, but because he has got intelligence, he can immediately understand I don't want him to come here. So how you can say there is no intelligence? The rascals say "The animals have no intelligence; therefore they have no soul." If one has no intelligence, there is no soul. That is admitted. But here is intelligence. How can you deny, "There is no soul"? The animals, the cows, when they are taken to the slaughterhouse, why they cry? Because he has intelligence that "Now I am going to be killed." And these rascals say there is no soul. And still, they are religious priests. Such fools and rascals are made religious fools, priests. No common sense. And they also get degree, Doctor of Divinity, DD. [break] ...Greek scholar, here in this Germany or in nearby?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't know Prabhupāda. We have been here for too short a time to find out who is exactly here, and all the people we contacted, their program was already fixed. They could not come, but they said they would be happy to meet you if you came again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. I wanted to know the philology of the Greek word "Kristo." Or is there any dictionary? Find out the word "Kristo."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, we can see today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Greek dictionary. [break] ...France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Germany is bordered by many countries-Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, France, Switzerland. So we are right in the center of Germany. So Germany is in the center of Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...even a single stick like this in the laboratory. What do you think? You can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is scientist? Simply talking. <span class="Italic">Vikathyante. Vikathyante.</span> This word is used in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> When one is covered by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he talks so many nonsense things, <span class="Italic">vikathayante.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> ...different living entities in different material bodies suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long you have a material body, you must suffer. Just like in prisonhouse. When the criminals are put there, they are punished different way according to the criminal offense, similarly, you are, we are all criminals, and for different types of suffering we have got different types of body. Different types of body means different types of suffering. Just like this tree is punished, "Stand here for three hundred years." This is punishment. Just like we do, "Stand up on the bench!" Children. So any kind of material body, even Lord Brahmā, that is suffering, different types of suffering. That's all. And if you want to be free from the suffering, then get out of this material body. This is... Kṛṣṇa says that this is a place for suffering. Where does He say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ:</span> [Bg. 8.16] "From the highest planet down to the lowest, all are places of suffering where birth and death take place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (aside:) Just from distance, not so near. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">. Duḥkha. Duḥkha</span> means suffering. <span class="Italic">Ālayam. Ālayam</span> means place. So the creator of this universe, the Supreme Lord, He is saying, "This is a place for suffering." And it is called Mṛtyu-loka, "For death, the planets for dying." That means death is unnatural to the eternal soul. But anywhere you live within this material world, you will die. That is material world. Either you live as a Brahmā or live as a small insect, ant, you must die. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate: [Bg. </span>8.19] death and again take birth, death and again take birth. But these rascals, they do not know: "This is natural, that's all." That one can stop this death and birth, they have no knowledge. And still, they are big, big scholars. They do not know that this movement is for stopping birth and death. Do they understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot believe it. They have no so brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say, "Well, that's the way you think in the East. It is very interesting."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why don't you think? That means you are fool. You cannot think, just like dog cannot think. So you are equal to dog. Tell them like that. It is not the question of East and West. It is the question of understanding. In the East also there are many rascals, and in the West there are many intelligent. If it is the East and West question, how the Western boys and girls taking this philosophy? It is not the East and West. It is the question of the rascal and intelligent. One who is intelligent, either he is East and West, he can understand. And one is a rascal, either he is East and West, he cannot understand. This is the real problem. Just like this cemetery. What is the use of keeping this cemetery, occupying unnecessarily so much land? And they are worshiping. They will not go to worship Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, but they will worship stone, <span class="Italic">bhūtejya,</span> offer flower, kneel down. And where the man has gone, he does not know. <span class="Italic">Bhūtejya.</span> And we saw in the Geneva. A big plot of land is occupied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Every city has two or three at least, very big, because everyone has to get such a plot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there are many ghosts also. Yes. Especially at night, if you go, you will see. There was a ghost in the house of John Lennon. John Lennon. I was guest there. There was a ghost. [break] ...binding to the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> to just remain a slave of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and drink this beer. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They introduced this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So before that, there was no Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, before that, there was no Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they were? No religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They were like you said. They were just tribes people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So these Germans were tribe people, uncivilized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, before Christianity, Europe was completely uncivilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Therefore the order is "Thou shalt not kill." Simply their business was killing. Uncivilized persons, they kill animals and eat. So due to past habit they could not forget this killing business. This is the proof that this system of religion was preached among the crude people, not civilized. So why they introduced this beer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It was a kind of refreshment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But before that, they were not drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There may have been something like wine. The monks also used to make wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they make wine. Uncivilized men, they know how to make wine. In India they do so by rice boiling and keep it for some days. It becomes wine, fermented. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...used to say that "I was drinking beer in barrels." He said. Forty years ago he said me like that. Here I don't see them, but Hamburg I have seen, yes, passing urine on the roadside. There are so many urine coming from the wall. 'Cause the more you drink beer, you will pass urine more. The German language is trinken, trinking. Drinking means trinking. Yes, I have seen it. Trinking or trinken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Trinken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...students, they are advancing for the unflinching faith on guru and Kṛṣṇa. This is the secret. [break] ...these devotees, how nice they are. They do not appreciate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I think most of them cannot understand it, but they sympathize, I think, because the principles are (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is appreciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, for the principles. At least in Germany we find that although people don't understand it, they appreciate that we are following the four principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...understood that this group is another edition of hippies. Gradually they are learning that they are not hippies. They are serious. [break] ...paper it was published that "Swami Bhaktivedanta has come in the right time." And what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, in a number of articles, the writer notes that Prabhupāda came at a perfect time in history, and went to the right place, the lower East Side of New York, and then again in Haight Ashbury, just when the hippie movement was big but they were looking for spiritual life. That is a historical expert move that you made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is very good remark, appreciated. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is known as <span class="Italic">patita-pāvana,</span> the deliverer of the most fallen. <span class="Italic">Patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra:</span> "My Lord, Your incarnation is for the reason to deliver all the fallen souls." So He gave one example by delivering Jagāi and Mādhāi, but by His grace, now thousands of Jagāi-Mādhāis are being delivered. He gave the example that here is the typical <span class="Italic">patita,</span> fallen. So this movement will deliver this kind of people. That is His prediction. Or it... factually by this movement, so many Jagāi-Mādhāis are being delivered. Jagāi... What was their fault? The fault was they were number one woman hunter and all other good qualifications: (laughing) drunkard, meat-eaters and thieves, rogues. That is their qualification. And immediately Caitanya Mahāprabhu turned them to become Vaiṣṇava. "Simply promise that... You say that you shall not commit anymore these sinful activities." "Yes, Sir, I will not." So that process we are going on. (end)</div>
