<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...about Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Indira Gandhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, Mahatma Gandhi. When I was in America three months ago, this was in a magazine, a new study. And it was very interesting because it showed that how subconsciously this man was very much, very much affected by sex, influenced. After I read it, I understood your comments a lot better, because it was a very frank study of details of his life and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You sit down, I'll show you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> I should sit in front here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, you stand and do it. Do it but do it strongly. Or you can do it like this, just comfortable. Comfortable. He was used to getting massage from woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, this is known. He used to have women devotees who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was known to everyone. And that was remarked that his granddaughter, I mean granddaughter-in-law, he was always accompanied, resting his head on their shoulder, he was walking. That was remarked by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, but they were not his granddaughter, his relative, and it was the wife of a relative. And he believed in honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was very sexually inclined. That is written by him. While his father was dying, he was engaged in sex with his wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Exactly. That is right. And therefore he felt very guilty toward sex. He was artificially depressing it. Therefore this article was pointing out that in his old age he was getting his satisfaction in a perverted way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By touching their bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is right, and at night he would sleep with them in the same bed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> He would get shivers. He would get shivers, and as a result of the shiver he would be covered with this woman. And her husband would object. Her husband would say, "Gandhiji, why do you have to do this? You know?" He would say, "You can see that I have no sexual inclination. This I want to prove that I have no sexual inclination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To show transcendental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, but he was cheating himself. He was sincere, but he was completely misguided, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it seems from that article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhakta.</span> Our formula is <span class="Italic">harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇāḥ.</span> If one is not devotee, he has no good qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, and he suffered all his life. He wanted good qualification, but he was concocting. He was taking some from <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and he was concocting some. Because he did not understand the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> properly, he rejected some of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because he did not have the blessing of Lord Caitanya, he did not understand it, so he rejected some of it, and as a result he was concocting. When he went to Africa, to South Africa, he started the movement there, this nonviolence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There it was failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> It was a failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty years he tried, it was failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. It was actually a very frank article, and after I read it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who wrote it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Somebody by the name of Mehta. He was obviously a very great scholar, because this magazine is very first-class magazine. It's not a cheap magazine, and it was written very nicely. Somebody by the name of Mehta. He's a Dr. Mehta. In the <span class="Italic">New Yorker</span> magazine, <span class="Italic">New Yorker.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written one book, <span class="Italic">My Experiment With Truth,</span> that truth is truth, but it is very (indistinct) thing. That means he did not know what is truth. (long pause-child says <span class="Italic">"haribol"</span>) He says <span class="Italic">"Haribol"</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol! Haribol! Haribol! Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol! Haribol! Haribol!</span> (devotees chant <span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Child:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span> (child makes sounds for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> (to child) Are you chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Europe begins from Turkey?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> From here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. Europe has small portion in Europe... Turkey has a small portion in Europe and a large portion in Asia Minor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Russia also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Russia is also above Turkey. Parts of it is in Europe, part of it is in Asia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Devotees are doing very well in Moscow, Prabhupāda? Is that right? They are distributing books there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not very good. But they have got some orders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> So when we preach to people we should first convince them that God is the supreme controller, the supreme proprietor. Then further understanding can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is a supreme controller. That you have to admit. You are not independent. Why they foolishly think independent? What is the reason they're foolishly thinking independent? What is their independence? Nobody is independent. So why they are foolishly thinking independent? You first challenge them. They are not independent. Are you independent? So why they foolishly declare independent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They are ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the position then? They are in ignorance, and they are leading the society as scientist, philosopher, politician. That is misleading. They cannot go even freely in the so-called moon planet excursion or Mars. Still, they are declaring independence. What is their independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> If someone accepts his dependence on God, then what is the second step? In preaching, so someone has accepted, "Yes, we are dependent on God," but actually they have no knowledge who God is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them knowledge from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you accept dependence on God, then you take instruction from God, how you'll be happy. Just like a child. The child knows he's fully dependent on parents. So he's fully obeying the orders of the parents, then he's happy, naturally. The father, mother, knows how to take care of the child and they're happy. And by nature they're dependent on father and mother. So they are happy. Mother says, "My dear child, sit down." He will sit down. By nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Some people are sectarian in their idea of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is sectarian? Every sect the child is dependent of the parents. What do you mean by sectarian? Does it mean the Hindu child does not depend on the parents? The Muslim child depends on the parents? Everyone depends on the parents. Either he may be Hindu child or Muslim child or Christian child, that is the nature of the child. Similarly, you may be Hindu, you may be Muslim, you are dependent on God. This is a fact. What is sectarian? Can the Muslims say that "No, no, we are not dependent on God"? Can the Christians say like that? We have to take the general condition: everyone is dependent on God. Where is the question of sectarian? Now this cloud, it is clouded, everyone is expecting some rain. Does it mean the rain is Hindu rain or Muslim rain or Christian rain? Dependent on cloud. Everyone is expecting rain. It doesn't matter whether he's Hindu, Muslim or Christian. Why they declare independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They say independence means you don't need anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> He's trying to define independence, and he said independence means you don't need anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> If you have no needs. Independence means that you have no need for anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even if you have needs, if you can supply need, your needs you can supply yourself, then you can call independent. But that is not the position. You cannot get the supplies independently. Why you are expecting cloud? Because if there is rainfall, there will be vegetation. Then you will be able to grow food. So you are dependent. Independently you cannot create cloud. So where is your independence? Every step, you are dependent. Independently you cannot create cloud. So where is your independence? Every step, you are dependent. Why do you declare independence? What is this foolishness? What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they think they have some independence because they have to make so many decisions about how to live and how to operate society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll answer for them. Law of gravitation.(?) (talking about child?) What is your independence? Are you independent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> There are all sorts of rascals, Śrīla Prabhupāda. One kind of rascal is the <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> kind, who like to enjoy. He thinks he is independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also dependent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, but he thinks, "I can eat chicken or eggs or fish."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, that is dependent. Wherefrom the chicken comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> From the fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fields? No, it comes from the chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, from the chicken, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore he has to depend on other chickens. (laughter) What is his independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> But I can kill them and eat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means if there is chicken you can kill. If there is supply of chicken, then you can kill. Otherwise, where is the opportunity of killing and eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> You cannot kill all the chickens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, even they kill, they are killing, but killing facility will be there if there is chicken. Just like a tiger in the jungle. They are very expert, but they do not get food daily. Because the other animals, they also know, that part of the jungle there is tiger. They avoid going there. So he doesn't get daily food. He kills one animal and keeps it hidden and takes little, little. He cannot... They are always hungry, although they have got good strength, but where is the opportunity? And there is one small animal, he's called <span class="Italic">feow.</span>(?) As soon as the tiger gets out to find out some prey, this small animal warns, "<span class="Italic">feow.</span>" The other animals will understand the tiger is coming. So despite getting good strength, good jaws, good nails, there is no food. He's dependent. If God supplies him, then he'll get opportunity. Otherwise, these nails and jaws and strength are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> But if I have good intelligence, I can make many machines and put many eggs in them and have all the supplies of chicken that I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also I have already explained, you depend on another chicken's egg. You cannot manufacture the egg. That is my challenge, that you manufacture the egg by chemical combination and put into the machine. That you cannot do. Another living chicken must lay down the egg, then you can reclaim. You're dependent. Where is your independence? Everywhere you are dependent. How you declare independence? Where is your independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> They think that the countries that have the materialistic advancement or scientific advancements, that they are very well situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, scientific advancement, all this nonsense you can say. Just like Iran. God has given the oil underneath the ground, you are so proud. But if God would not give you the oil, then you starve in the desert. Then talk of improvement, nonsense. You're dependent on the oil. That is given by God. By God's grace, you have got some stock of oil, and there is good demand of oil. Then you are proud of making advancement. You are depending on the oil. The oil is supplied by God. You're dependent. Where is your independence? When the oil is finished, then your all pride is finished. Where is your independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> But we do not believe in God and still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do or do not believe in God, but you are not independent, that's a fact. You don't believe or do believe, it doesn't matter. But you are dependent. You are not independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, we are dependent on nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you cannot say that you are independent. That is the point that we are discussing. You call nature, I call God, it doesn't make any difference. But you are dependent on something else. You can call it nature, but nature is also God's nature. Anyway, accept nature. So,</div>
<div class="Verse">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br class="calibre2"/>guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br class="calibre2"/>kartāham iti manyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.27]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So take it, nature, nature is acting in her own way. So nature is not your father's servant. So how do you declare independent, that I am everything? Even if you accept nature, you are not independent. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> But I am not independent, I am more dependent on my intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What intelligence? If dependent, what is the meaning of intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes, I'm depending on my own intelligence to utilize everything for advancement, for my comfort and my strength and food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything, if there is no everything, then what is the meaning of intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> But I may develop more intelligence to create what I lack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is theory. That is not fact. [break] That is given by nature or God, whatever you say. That is not in your intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> God may have given us all the basic things, but it's taken man's intelligence to make the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, but if God has given you so many basic things, then you can use your intelligence. Otherwise, your intelligence... There is a story that one man was asked by his friend, "Have you got intelligence?" He began to search out here. So, "What is this?" He said, "Intelligence means when there is money here. Otherwise, I am even though I have got intelligence, useless." You can utilize your intelligence provided you have got the means. Intelligence also you cannot utilize properly if there is no supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, Svarūpa Dāmodara pointed out when we were in Washington that most of these big, big men, they admit that they don't know where their inspiration comes from; it just comes. Just like that Mozart or one of those composers. He just used to write the music, but he had no idea where it was coming from. He did not think it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: mattaḥ, mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So intelligence comes from God. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> One of the questions Iranians ask a lot is that if He is giving us intelligence, why doesn't He give us enough intelligence so that we could be God conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's giving. Read the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. But you rascals don't accept, what can be done? God is personally coming to give you intelligence, take this intelligence. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I come when there is no intelligence, when you are all rascals, I come to give you intelligence, but you don't take, what can I do?" That is God's mission, that "These rascals, without properly being guided they'll go to hell. Let Me give them some intelligence." That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, that is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. Arjuna is <span class="Italic">kārpaṇya doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ:</span> "I have become confused, so give me intelligence." <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's taking intelligence, how to tackle the situation. He was confused. He was to fight as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> but he saw that the persons with whom he has to fight, they are all family members. So what kind of fight is that? Who is fighting with family members? That was his confusion. Suppose we are Kṛṣṇa conscious society. Then if we declare fight amongst ourselves, is that very intelligent? So actually the Kurukṣetra battle was like that. Some intrigue of Dhṛtarāṣṭra that his son will occupy the throne, that was the cause of the fight. So Arjuna thought that "My uncle may be intriguing person, he has brought this disaster, fight amongst the family members, so why shall I do it? Better let them enjoy. They are also family members. Why this unnecessary fight?" He was responsible. He was not unreasonable, very good man, that "After all, they are also our family members, let them enjoy. Why there is unnecessary fight amongst family members?" He was not a coward, but he's good reasonable man, that "We are all brothers. They want to rule over. Let them rule over. Why fight?" Sometimes it is misunderstood, Kṛṣṇa is misunderstood, that Arjuna is such a nice man, he didn't want to fight, and Kṛṣṇa's inducing him "Yes, you must fight." It is puzzling. God is inducing a good man to fight, who does not want to fight. It is really puzzling. Is it not? Arjuna is a good, nice man, that "After all, it is family property. So other brothers, they want to rule it over. Let them do it. I shall better beg only. Why shall I kill them?" It is good proposal. Very nice gentleman's proposal. And Kṛṣṇa said, "No, you must fight." So that Kṛṣṇa's position is very awkward, that He'll induce such a good man to fight. So superficially one can criticize, "How is this? What kind of God you have got, Kṛṣṇa, that He induces a very nice gentleman to fight in the family?" Superficially, it is like that. But they do not know that this is foolishness, to deny the order of Kṛṣṇa. So who can understand this philosophy? Unless one is a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he cannot understand. From superficial angle of vision, Kṛṣṇa is inducing a nice gentleman to fight, and we are worshiping that Kṛṣṇa? So it is very puzzling. "Your God is like that? What kind of God you have got? Inducing gentleman to fight amongst family?" They can criticize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> We have to say what kind of family he has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Superficially, this is the position. But still Arjuna says that "You instruct me." He doesn't give up, he doesn't reject Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa, I am such a gentleman. I do not wish to fight. You are inducing me to fight, I don't want Your guidance." No. <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi mām [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]-"I surrender unto You." And therefore Arjuna is so great. He's not so-called gentleman; he is devotee. What was your question, why God does not come to instruct us? Who said? You told me. It was your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, why doesn't He give us enough intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's giving intelligence. But if you don't accept, what can be done? He has come Himself, and He's giving intelligence. You take it and be happy. But if you don't take it, what God can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then your argument that I have no independence, that's not correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You have got independence, little independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You have freedom to choose intelligence or be a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got independence to misuse your independence. That independence you have got. You have been given intelligence. Now you have got, because you have got intelligence, little independence, you can misuse that. Just like you are all my secretaries. So I give you some independence. You can misuse it. So that misuse is wrong. Then you'll become unhappy. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Says. He doesn't force you-you must do it. You do it. That means independence. Now it is your choice. You have got independence of misusing it. So independence is a quality inherent in living beings, because he's part and parcel of God. The quality of the father is inherited by the son, even physically. Similarly, you have..., God is fully independent, you have got little touch of independence. Now that independence is properly utilized when you carry out the order of God. That is proper. Ordinarily, every country is independent. Does it mean that he is cent percent independent? No. Then why there is police department? Similarly, we are part and parcel of God. We have got little independence. But if we misuse it, then we shall be punished. So there is no question of independence. Independence, little. That is interdependence, not independence. Why they declare independence? That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's always very relative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not absolute. Absolute independence, God. Even if you have got little independence it is relative, under condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> And the purpose of <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is to direct this minute independence so that it is not misused?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in your state, you are independent citizen, but you must be guided by the laws. If you violate the laws, immediately you will be prisoner. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is like that, law. You have little independence, you can utilize it fully, under the laws. As soon as you violate, you are immediately put into suffering. Because you are a citizen of an independent country, America, doesn't mean that you can do whatever you like. But you do according to the laws of the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> You were talking the other morning on the walk about <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means what God says, that is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> But you have created your own <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> You give up that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's not referring to <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Law given by the state, that is law. If you create a law at home, that is not law. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means what is ordained by Kṛṣṇa, God, that is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And other things, that may be temporary. You can create some laws within your family, but that is not generally applicable to others. But when it is given by the government, that is real law. That is applicable to all people. When you go out to the street, you have to abide by the laws of the state, the light. As soon as there is red light, you have to stop. At home you may not make such rules and regulations. But that is within your home, that is not general. Similarly, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66] means what you have made at your home, concoction, give up all these <span class="Italic">dharmas.</span> Here is the real <span class="Italic">dharma, mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Everyone has to surrender to Kṛṣṇa or God. So that is real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that what it means in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> when Kṛṣṇa says that we have to go <span class="Italic">śruti-vipratipannā,</span> we have to go beyond just hearing about these different...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out that verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śruti vipratipannā te<br class="calibre2"/>yadā sthāsyati niścalā<br class="calibre2"/>samādhāv acalā buddhis<br class="calibre2"/>tadā yogam avāpsyasi</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"When your mind is no longer disturbed by the flowery language of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and when it remains fixed in the trance of self-realization, then you will have attained the divine consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So ritualistic ceremonies, Vedic ritualistic ceremonies. Everywhere there are some ritualistic ceremony. So when you go above this... Just like Kṛṣṇa says in another place, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyo.</span> By performing the Vedic ritualistic ceremony, the ultimate goal is to understand Kṛṣṇa. So if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then you may not perform this ritualistic ceremony. Because you have come to the objective. Not before that. That is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Vedic ritualistic ceremony is that if you perform this <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then you go to the heavenly planet and there you'll get so long life, ten thousands of years, you get nice woman, and so on, so on. People are after that, <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa.</span> So this <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> is required so long one is unaware of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one understands this <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> elevation is not the aim of our life, our real aim of life how to go back home, back to Godhead, then these things are not required. Just like we have no ritualistic ceremony, we have simply devotional service. We have no ritualistic ceremony. There are so many things ritualistic. And we are performing only this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra, mahā-mantra.</span> Therefore the <span class="Italic">smārta brāhmaṇas,</span> they misunderstand. They do not admit that they have become elevated. The Jagannātha temple does not allow. But when one becomes a pure Vaiṣṇava, then <span class="Italic">tepus tapas te juhuvuḥ sasnur āryā</span> [SB 3.33.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has performed all the ritualistic devotion. There are many statements in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> that when you come to the devotional platform, you haven't go to perform these ritualistic ceremonies. Because the end of ritualistic ceremony, you have come to the point. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">. Kaitava</span> means cheating. Cheating type of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is rejected here. This <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa,</span> by performing some ritualistic ceremony you may go to a heavenly planet, but what benefit you will have? That one has to understand. You can enjoy there materialistic, highest type of materialistic civilization means eating, sleeping, mating. These things you can get, but you have to come back again. <span class="Italic">Kṣine punye martya-lokaṁ viśanti [Bg. </span>9.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> So what benefit there is? No benefit. Just like in British period, some Englishman was made viceroy of India. Then after five years they sent to London, again with his bag, marketing in the street. This has been seen practically. Lord such-and-such, he's traveling in a third-class compartment with a bag for marketing. But so long he was viceroy, oh, so much honor, so much prestige. So where is that prestige now? These ritualistic ceremonies are like that. For more years you become viceroy, and then again fall down. That is your Nixon. What is the position of Nixon now? He is ordinary man. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's making a lot of money from his book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, everyone will read, but he's not in that position of President. Money, there are many merchants that make more money than Nixon. That is not the criterion. That position. So it is like that. So what is Mr. Ali's...? Any question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Sorry, I can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Would you be more comfortable inside, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am quite all right. If you want to go, I shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> If we have more people, if more people come, then we'll go inside. If they come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda was wondering if you had any questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> All right. I was thinking about the material platform that you mentioned last night, and I could not figure out how vast this platform is, what does it consist of, how do we define this platform. Is nature materialism? I mean, there are many things which are obvious, such as money, greed, etc. But how about nature, love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got three platforms, generally. Material platform divided into two-gross and subtle, and there is spiritual platform. The body is material platform, divided into two, gross and subtle. And then if you are fortunate enough to come to the spiritual platform, then your life is successful. So the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> generally... Just like we see in the city, they are all busy, working very hard. They are on the gross material platform. And then next class, just like scientist, poet, philosopher, they are in the subtle platform. And above them, there are persons who are simply interested in spiritual understanding. They are on the spiritual platform. So according to the platform, there are thoughts and activities also. Your question is what is about these so many things. So first of all you have to understand in which platform he is situated. Then his activities are ascertained. If you are in the material platform, doing some business, making some profit, and if you bring there question-"What is this, use of material profit, this body is temporary, why I am..."-then your material activities will be diminished.(?) So we have to understand first of all what is our actual objective. And then if we stand in that platform, then our life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Does this mean that a person should turn his attention from the world, from his surrounding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you cannot do. Just like we are, although we are interested fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it doesn't mean that we do not live in a house, we do not eat, we do not use motorcar, we do not use typewriter, dictaphone. We are using everything. But the purpose is different. We are traveling and paying heavily to the air companies. Whenever I travel, at least five, six men go with me, and one round trip world travel means sixteen thousand dollars or sixteen hundred dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Sixteen thousand. About five, six people, one round trip is about twelve thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So twelve thousand dollars means about more than one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees. So we are spending that, but not for any other purpose than for Kṛṣṇa's service. Anywhere we speak we are talking only Kṛṣṇa, trying to push on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is our business. So the platform is different, eh? Externally, one can see, they are also spending so much money for traveling, they are living in a nice house and they have some nice car. But the consciousness is different. Another example in this connection, that I am sitting on this chair and there is a bug also. He is also sitting on this chair. But that does not mean the bug and myself equal. The bug's business is different, my business is different. But superficially, if one sees that the bug and Swamiji's on the same chair, therefore they're all equal? That is not the fact. Similarly, we may be using all these material things, but we have no material business. We have simply spiritual business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> It is living in the material world without become attached to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have no attachment. We can sit down, in this nice building, we can sit down anywhere. We are not attached to this building; we are attached to push on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is our business. And unconditionally we can push on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> It is not that if we don't get a nice building as Atreya Ṛṣi has supplied, then we cannot push on. No. That is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like I began this movement underneath a tree in New York, Tompkinson Square, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Tompkins Square Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I used to sit down there. There was no <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> A small <span class="Italic">dundubi.</span> And I was chanting three hours-Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. And people used to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> In a very bad neighborhood. Very low-class neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Low-class, high-class, we don't mind. We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. That 26 Second Avenue also not very good neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> It's the worst place in the country. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I did not know. Mukunda suggested this is good place, all right, live here. And actually happened to be good place. Gradually, all my disciples came. So I had no disturbance. I was living in the Bowery Street, and on my door these bums were lying with urine and wine bottles and everything. Still, they were so respectful. When I'll come, "Yes, you can enter. Please." (laughter) I had no quarrel with them. They were very kind. They welcomed me, they opened the door, "Please go." They also knew that "He's a harmless..." So, platform, if you remain on the spiritual platform, this material condition cannot hamper you. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> Then <span class="Italic">yenātmā suprasīdati,</span> in that condition you can execute. First of all, we have to ascertain on which platform we shall stand. And if you want to stand on the spiritual platform, nothing can check it. That is not conditioned. So why not stand directly to the spiritual platform and make you life successful? That is our preaching. People in general, they do not know the importance of the spiritual platform. Therefore they prefer to stay in the material platform. They have no sufficient education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Why couldn't spirits grow without taking this body? Why couldn't spirits grow in the spiritual world without taking this material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can go. It is your punishment. The material body... If one thinks in the prison house, "How one can live without prison house?" That is his misconception. Generally, one is expected to live outside the prison. But because that person is in the prison house since a long time, he cannot think that without prison house one can live; that is misconception. He has no idea of spiritual life, therefore he's thinking like that. Real business is how to get out of the prison. But he's thinking just the opposite way, that "If I do not remain in the prison, how can I eat?" A thief is thinking that "I'm living here very comfortably, without stealing. I'm getting food and shelter, and if I go outside I have to steal again." So it is good life? That is due to ignorance. There is very good life without the prison house. That he does not know. He does not know that there is a spiritual world where a spirit soul can live very comfortably, meeting God every day, talking with Him, dancing with Him. That he has no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> How can a spirit become so ignorant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On account of no education. Therefore we are giving education. Because they are in gross ignorance, they require education. Therefore this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, educational.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> In the beginning how does the spirit become ignorant, falls into ignorance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not... Just like the same question, a criminal, if you say, "In the beginning, how he became criminal," is that very intelligent question? What do you think? A prisoner, criminal, is living in the prison house since a long time, and if you raise this question, "In the beginning, how he became a criminal," is that very intelligent question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, but not everyone is prisoner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this question. Anyone can become criminal, any moment. There is no question of beginning. At any moment you can begin. You are honest gentleman, very good. You are working in a nice spot. At any time, any moment, you can become a criminal and go to prison house. That is... You are prone to... As soon as you misuse your little independence, you become a criminal. That is the difficulty. You have got some independence. As soon as we misuse that independence, immediately we are criminal, go to prison house. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣa guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot cheat material nature. Immediately she captures. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vañcha kare pasate māyā tare japati 'dhare.</span> That beginning is possible at any moment. You haven't got to trace out the history. Event if you are very honest, you can become subjected to these criminal law at any moment. You are prone to that. So there is no use wasting time how it was begun. You are criminal. Now make your treatment that you may not become criminal again. If you go to a doctor, you have got some sickness, and if the doctor inquires, "How it began?" How it began? What business? Now I have got sickness, you treat me. That's all. What is the use of wasting time how it began? Some way or other, it has begun. Now I've come to you, make treatment. That's all. Why should we waste our time to find out the history how it began? That beginning can be possible at any moment. As soon as we misuse our little independence, immediately the beginning is there. A criminal means one who has violated the laws of the state. That is a fact. So when that violation began, so that is not very important thing. You have violated, you are in the prison house. That's all. That is important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Yes, that's right. My question is answered, but my confusion is still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that confusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> I'm amazed that... When someone tastes something, a nice fruit, something pleasant, he remembers, appreciates that, even in material world. How could someone see God and come from a source as powerful and lovable as that and then forget? How could he forget so easily and become so badly attached to this materialism? Why is it that we are so far? I know it's in due course to my actions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That tendency is here. Because we are very small fragment of spiritual identity, that tendency is there. The example is given, just like fire and spark of the fire. The fire and the spark, the spark is very small, but it is fire. And the big fire, together they look very beautiful. With the fire, when the sparks come-<span class="Italic">sput sput</span>-so many sparks, it looks very beautiful. But the sparks sometimes fall down from the original fire. Then it is no more fire. It is fire, but it's extinguished. The illumination is over. So we are small particles of God. God is big fire; we are small particles of God. So we are playing with the big fire very nice, but there is chance of falling down. That chance is there. The big fire does not fall. The big fire is always blazing. But the small fire, although it is possessing the same quality of fire, it may fall down. So we are small particle, very, very small, atomic portion God. Therefore we have got the tendency to be separated from the big fire, and then we begin our material body. Just like another crude example, just like a very rich man's son, he's enjoying life. Sometimes he thinks, "Why not independently live? Why dependent of father?" He goes out and he becomes a hippie. There are many examples. He was living very comfortably, rich man's son, but he left the house of his father and became a hippie. There are many practical examples. Why does he do so? I have seen in Allahabad one big lawyer, very famous lawyer, Ferolal Bannerji. He had two sons. One son became a good barrister like him, and another son became a car-<span class="Italic">wala,</span> driving a car. The reason was that this son, a car-<span class="Italic">wala,</span> he fell in love with a low-class woman, and he preferred to remain a car-<span class="Italic">wala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Low-class woman. So she was living in a cottage, hut, cottage. So out of love he also preferred that "I shall live with her, and I shall drive a car." So that is independence. He preferred. So that discrimination preference is there always. You can prefer a low-grade life out of your discretion. Nobody can check you. And by cultivation of knowledge, you can become a big man. The two tendencies are there. There is no stereotyped idea. Otherwise, he has no independence. Who was speaking of that owl? There is an animal, owl. He doesn't like to remain in the sunlight. So that is also an animal. He is also eating, sleeping, mating, but he doesn't like the sunlight. What can you do? So God has given him all facility to remain as an owl, in darkness. That is God's kindness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> So we can fall as far as we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fall or rise also. Why do you say fall? You can rise to the highest platform from the fallen condition. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That you are in a fallen condition, come to the highest platform and talk with God, play with God, dance with God. That is our opportunity. Now it is up to you to take it or not to take it. That is up to you. But our propaganda is this, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> You simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Then <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ tyaktvā deham [Bg. </span>4.9]-this is our propaganda. We are trying to induce people to understand Kṛṣṇa. Then his life is successful. But if you don't try to understand, that is your business. But we are offering that here is a movement, you try to understand Kṛṣṇa. What is the wrong there? But if you don't like, who can force you? We are going country to country, door to door, town to town. What is our business? We are simply requesting that "You try to understand Kṛṣṇa." And Kṛṣṇa says, "As soon as you understand Me, you come to Me." <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]. Now it is up to you. If you take theoretically, that "If by understanding Kṛṣṇa I can go to the eternal, blissful spiritual life," why not try it? And if you inquire that, "All right, it is very good proposal. By going back to Kṛṣṇa, everything is solved. Yes, I'll go. So what is the method?" Then if I say, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," where is the difficulty? Why you are so much determined not to do anything to go back to home, back to Godhead? That is your misfortune. If it is so easy, and it is the means of solving all the problems, why not try it? "All right, let me try in this life." Why don't you do it? It is not a very difficult task. If you don't do it, then you are misfortunate. Therefore Caitanya, <span class="Italic">kono bhāgyavan jīva.</span> This is the process to be adopted by the some fortunate persons. But they do not want to become fortunate. They want to remain unfortunate. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> So obviously this ignorance follows, even when we leave this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You leave this body, you accept another body. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara prāptir.</span> Just like you have already accepted. When you were a child, this body was not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Does this happen instantly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not instantly. I mean to say you have changed your body. Similarly, after giving up this body, you'll change to another body. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> And between those gaps, we are sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no gap. The nature's law... It is said that just like you are walking, step by step, like this, so when you fix up this step, then you take away this step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Example of a caterpillar, how it moves from one leaf to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, when you by nature's law when it is fixed up, you have to accept this body, then you give up this body, and immediately enter into the womb of the mother to prepare another similar body like the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> During this transformation, are we still ignorant? During this transformation from body to body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's not ignorant. This body, next body is achieved according to the consciousness. At the time of, if you are thinking of something to which you are very much attached, then you get that similar body. If you are thinking of your pet dog, then you get the dog's body. And if you are thinking of Kṛṣṇa, God, then you'll get the body like Kṛṣṇa. That will be decided at the time of your death. Because at the time of death you'll be absorbed with thinking which you have done throughout the whole life. <span class="Italic">Sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like the whole day you are working with some business, at night also dreaming that, subtle body. So you have to train up yourself within this life how to think of Kṛṣṇa. Then there is chance of thinking of Kṛṣṇa at the time of death and go back to home. It is not difficult. Very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> So the ultimate goal is not to come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the use of coming here to suffer? Who is happy here? Can you find out anybody who is happy here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Not that I've seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not that he has seen. He's not seen anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody. Do you think your king, Shah, is also happy? No. His sons, daughter, they are happy? No. He is also anxious how to keep his position, exalted position, he has to makes many plans, satisfy so many ministers, so many. He is also full of anxiety. And a small bird eating some grain here, he's attracted for the grain, but he's looking this way, "Oh, here is a man, here is man, he may not do some harm to me." So everyone is full of anxiety. Nobody can be free from anxiety. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna dhiyam asad-grahāt [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because we have adopted this material life, <span class="Italic">asad,</span> our mind should always be full of anxiety. Nobody can be free from anxiety. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna dhiyam asad-grahāt.</span> Because we have accepted this temporary body, we have to be full of anxiety. This is law of nature. And if we act in this life to create another material body, then our all activities are spoiled. <span class="Italic">Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.</span> He did not ask about the constitutional position of himself, he simply engaged himself in dog's place(?). Then whatever activities he has done, it is simply defeat. Next body what he's going to get he does not know. If you become a minister in this life and next life you become a dog, then what is the benefit? Can anyone challenge this? "No, no, I'm not going to become a dog." Nobody can say. You are going to change the body-<span class="Italic">tatha dehāntara prāptir</span>-now what kind of body you'll get, that will depend on nature, not on yourself. If you go to a tailor's shop, so you have to pay for if you want a better garment. Similarly, what kind of body you will get, that will depend on your work. So in this life you may be a prime minister, but if you have worked like menial dogs and hogs, then you are going to get body of a dog and hog. That is nature's gift. You cannot check it. You have no hand on the administration of the nature. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you have infected some disease, you must suffer from that. This is nature's law. You cannot say, "Although I have infected the smallpox disease, I'll not suffer." No, you have to suffer. Or you have to die of that disease. You cannot check it. So they do not know how nature is going. Declaring independence. That is foolishness. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> And people are kept in ignorance. There is no school, no college, no institution to give instructions about this science. This is the position of modern civilization. People are kept in ignorance. They got the chance of human body to understand the value of life, but they are not given education by the father, by the guardian, by the king, by the guru. Nobody is giving. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says you should not become a guru, you should not become a father, you should not become a king unless you are able to save him from these laws of nature, repetition of birth and death. Then you should not become. It's the duty of the guardians to give education to the dependents about the spiritual knowledge. But who is doing that? We are trying our bit because we are ordered by superior that "You do it." So we are trying as far as possible, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Is there a time limit for this spiritual growth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in a moment you can be spiritually enlightened. So why don't you agree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Why I mean is from the time that you start, has it got deadline or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, starting, just like when there is a seed sown, the starting is there. Now it grows a tree and there is fruit, there is flowers. The fruit is green now. When it is yellow mango and ripe, you can take. The beginning is when you sow the seed. Just like child. The father puts the seed within the womb of the mother. The body begins from that moment, grows and grows. When it is fully grown up it comes out and acts and then walks. So beginning is there. You can begin at any moment. But it is spiritual, it does not take so much time. You should remember spiritual. Just like speed, there are different kinds of speed. Mental speed and physical speed. Physical speed, you have got a very good nice airplane. Still, you have to take ten hours to reach London. And mental speed, you can immediately, within a second, go to London. And spiritual speed, still more. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> as soon as you give up the body you immediately go to Kṛṣṇa. That is spiritual speed. Immediately. Not that so many miles, oh, Kṛṣṇaloka is far, far above this material sky, then spiritual sky. No. The spiritual speed is so high that <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ,</span> as soon as you give up this body, immediately. You can compare material speed and mental speed. Although you haven't got spiritual idea, still, we can at least imagine what is that spiritual speed. The mental speed is so rapid that by the speedy airplane I'll have to take four hours, you can reach there in four seconds by mental speed. That is with our experience. Then we can imagine how speedy is spiritual. It is actually known by education. It is a science. It is not sentiment. And everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> How do you classify dreams?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dreams is mental, subtle platform. Your gross body is not working, but your subtle mind is working. That's all. It is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> The master is usually on a totally different level. It is quite obvious, from the actions, the talks, the understanding and the experience. How close does one student usually, how close does he get to the master? How closely does he understand the master? Or he could interrelate himself to the master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's asking how intimate does the connection become between the master and the disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply by association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> But whatever you talk about, it comes from experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is association. Just like you came yesterday, you have come again. Similarly, if you come again and again, then you become one of them. Association. You understand, then you become one of them. If you remain in touch with the fire, then you become warm, warm, warmer, and then fire. That example I have given you, the iron rod. Put it in the fire, association, it becomes warm, warmer, and one day, iron. After few hours you'll see that the iron rod is red hot. It is no more iron; now it is fire. Association. By association one can become spiritualized. It is very important thing. We are opening so many branches all over the world with this purpose, to give the facility of association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> There are also so many masters now, so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your choice. Just like when you go to the market there are so many shops. Now it is your choice from which shop you have to purchase. First of all, you must know what is your need. If you want gold and if you go to the cigarette shop, "Give me gold," then what benefit you'll get? He'll give you a cigarette and he'll cheat you, "Here is gold."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it possible to sit inside? There are seven, eight people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You can continue the discussion inside. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...a small child, he does not know what is the meaning of bowing down. But he's doing it. This is association. But he's getting benefit. Not that because he does not know, he's not getting benefit. He's getting benefit. (pause) You can put this light on that side, anywhere, or down, keep it down. (speaks in Hindi to guests)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Mr. Sharma is a devotee. He's a wonderful person. He's taken to spiritual life and is very serious about it. Mr. Sahani is also very serious, he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, every Indian is a devotee. This is the privilege of taking birth in India. There is... Naturally he's devotee, and if he takes little education, take advantage of the Vedic instructions, then his life is successful. In the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said even the demigods, they desire to take birth in India because this facility is there in India. This facility, the land is so sanctified that anyone who takes the body from this land, he's born sanctified. Now, if he further takes advantage of the Vedic knowledge, then his life becomes successful. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is that anyone who has taken birth in India, make his life successful, and then preach this knowledge to the outside world. The exact word,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari 'kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Outside India they are in darkness. So it is the duty of the Indian to make his life perfect and spread his spiritual knowledge to the outside world. That is real welfare activity in the human society. That we are trying to do. Unfortunately, they have not taken very seriously what glorious activities for India we are doing. They do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Excuse me, does that mean that people from other religions may..., it is not possible for them to achieve the highest perfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's possible. If you take advantage of the highest college, then you become..., there is possibility to becoming highly educated. You cannot become highly educated sitting down in a dark room. That is not possible. Is it possible? You have to associate, take admission in the society where people are actually highly educated. The advantage is there, the possibility is there, but you have to take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> From their own religion also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you bring in religion? We are talking of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Knowledge is there in all the religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Religion is now misunderstood. Religion is described in the dictionary, "a faith." So faith..., your faith may be something, my faith may be something, that is not religion. Religion is described in the Vedic literature, "the law given by God." That is religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So, just like law means the order given by the state, similarly, religion means the order given by God. So if you do not know what is God, what is His order, then what is your religion? Do you believe it or not? If you do not know what is God, if you do not know what is His word or what is His order, then where is your religion? If you do not know what is the government and if you do not know what is the government's order, then where is the question of law-abiding? Religion means, according to Vedic description.... Just like Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">mām ekām śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> This is religion. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "Give up all this nonsense. Surrender unto Me." So what is the objection? Religion is one, surrender to God. So where is the objection? And God says that "You surrender to Me." So where is the objection? Religion cannot be two. Religion is one, surrender to God. If I say, "You are Muslim, you surrender to God, " do you have any objection? If I say to Christian, "You surrender to God," will he have any objection? Therefore religion is one; there cannot be two religions. Why you are bringing other religions? There is no question of other religions. Religion is one. You accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody should have any objection. And if you do not surrender to God, then what is the meaning of your religion? It is bogus. That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Here in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> all this bogus type of religion is rejected. And what is that bogus type of religion? Bogus type means which religion does not know who is God and how to love Him. That's all. Do you agree or not? So religion cannot be two; religion one. God is one, and to offer our submission to Him, that is religion. Simple thing. And God comes personally to demand this. <span class="Italic">Sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is religion. Now say what is your objection about this religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> No objection at all. Religion means surrender to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is religion. And that is first-class faith which teaches how to surrender to God. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> This is the highest knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the highest knowledge. It doesn't matter whether you are Muhammadan, Christian or Hindu or this or that. Whether you know God and you have fully surrendered to Him, then it is perfect. Otherwise, it is simply waste of time. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevamalam.</span> If you simply perform the ritualistic ceremonies very strictly, but you have no idea of God, you have no knowledge how to love Him, it is simply waste of time. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam. </span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">You are very religious, very nice, but are you interested with God or dog? "No, I am interested with dog." Then where is religion? Religion means you must be interested with God. That is religion What is the report? How much they are interested now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Forty million pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Forty million pounds are being spent in Germany to take care of dog. This is advancement of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> And how to surrender to God, how to do this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply surrender to God, immediately. He says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> For a layman who doesn't know anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People do not know. Therefore God comes personally to teach you. Why don't you take the teaching? Why don't you take the teaching? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> why don't you become fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Yes, we follow, you know. Someone has to create interest first, and then people will take the teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is conditional. But He wants unconditional surrender. That is religion. Of course, if you cannot surrender unconditionally, then you at least practice. That is also instructed. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> At least think of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> What is the difficulty if you think of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> What is the difficulty if you think of Kṛṣṇa? What is the difficulty? Is there any difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> You first have to surrender to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No difficulty. If you chant Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, where is the difficulty? That is <span class="Italic">mana-manā.</span> Apply your mind to Kṛṣṇa. Where is the difficulty? The difficulty is that we'll not do it. That is our determination. We shall do everything, but not this. That is the difficulty. Otherwise, there is no difficulty. Everyone will teach about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so many things they will speak, but nobody speaks that you surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Rather, they will say Kṛṣṇa is fictitious, there was no Kṛṣṇa, there was no... They mislead, that's all. And he becomes a big scholar. The more he deviates you, misguides you, he become a big scholar. This is going on. Is it not? There are so many scholars, politicians, philosophers, they are talking of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. Nobody is talking that Kṛṣṇa, surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Am I right or wrong? They'll say "We have got different meaning of Kṛṣṇa" All the sages, all the saintly persons, they have accepted Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna, when he understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, he immediately accepted Kṛṣṇa: <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is understanding of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Keśava, whatever You have spoken, I take it altogether as it is." <span class="Italic">Sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> All fact. And they are manufacturing some meaning. How they'll understand Kṛṣṇa? This is going on. And our, this movement has become little successful.... People give me such credit, "Swamiji, you have done wonderful." But I do not know what wonderful. I do not know any magic. I simply say that you accept Kṛṣṇa or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. That's all. That is my magic. And they are accepting it. They are accepting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. They do not make any interpretation, that "Kṛṣṇa means this, Kurukṣetra means this, Pāṇḍavas means this." No. We are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. You have seen our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? That's all. [break] Before this, before this movement I started ten years ago, so many swamis, philosophers came in the Western country. Not a single person became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is our challenge. And now you'll find thousands and thousands. Because, what is secret? "As it is," that's all. No change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> But as it is, it is in Sanskrit, and it is very difficult to understand in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all. What is the difficulty? Suppose</div>

<div class="After-Verse">So <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre.</span> Kurukṣetra is still there, and it is a <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra.</span> From Vedic order, Kurukṣetra is <span class="Italic">dharma ācaret.</span> Still, people go there by thousands and by millions as pilgrimage. So where is the difficulty <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1]</span>? Unless you make difficulty. But as the literature is, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1],</span> where is the difficulty to understand it? Kurukṣetra is there and it is <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra.</span> Where is the difficulty? Unless you make it difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> What is the meaning of "as it is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "As it is" means Kurukṣetra is Kurukṣetra, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra</span> is <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra.</span> That is "as it is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa, Pāṇḍava is Pāṇḍava. That is "as it is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> Kṛṣṇa explains who is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you have to understand. So Kṛṣṇa is explained Himself, "I am this." <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "There is no more superior authority than Me." We accept it. Why you accept another authority to understand Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no difficulty as it is. But we create difficulty. If somebody asks me, "Where is your nose?" if I say, "Here is my nose." And if I say, "No here," (laughter) then it is difficulty. If I say directly, "Here is my nose," then there will be no difficulty. But if I want to do like this, then it is difficulty. There is no difficulty. We have created difficulty. That is our folly. Therefore there is no result. That is the present position, that we have created difficulty in understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and we Indians are now practically out of our own culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Those who don't understand Kṛṣṇa, it's difficult for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he will understand? He creates difficulty to understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the supreme authority," and the person who heard from Kṛṣṇa, he says <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramam</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> He accepts Kṛṣṇa as the supreme authority, Arjuna. And why we deviate? The speaker says that He is the supreme authority, and the listener, Arjuna, accepts Him. Now why we interpret? What right you have got interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> We interpret it according to our own design.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? You cannot, if you have own design, don't touch <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. You make your own design and preach otherwise. Why you take advantage of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? This is criminal. If you have got a different philosophy, you preach. Everyone has got the right. But why you misinterpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? When you take advantage of the popularity of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and you speak nonsense, that is not good. That has murdered the whole thing. And practically we see that. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, you try to understand, you get the benefit and you life is successful. Besides that, interpretation when it is required. When things are understood directly, there is no question of interpretation. The law of interpretation is like this: when the things are not distinct, then you can interpret in your own way, I can interpret in my own way, but when the things are distinct, there is no question of interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> If that's so, then we don't understand because we don't want to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the folly. You don't want to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Because we have so many desire, we don't want to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We want to become bigger than Kṛṣṇa, than Arjuna. This is our folly. But the process is, as recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to understand from the higher authorities.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">As soon as you give up this line of understanding, then it is lost. <span class="Italic">Yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> Then you are dealing in not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> something else, something rubbish. <span class="Italic">Yogo naṣṭaḥ,</span> it is <span class="Italic">naṣṭaḥ,</span> it is spoiled. As soon as you interpret, it is spoiled. First of all, why you should interpret? If the meaning is clear, there is no chance of interpreting. If the meaning is not clear, then you can interpret. <span class="Italic">Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1]</span> is clear. Why should you interpret? <span class="Italic">Baliye</span> (Hindi) If <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra kuru-kṣetra</span> is clear, why would you interpret? When things are clear, interpretation means you are playing joke. So our, this movement presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. So they are being accepted all over the world, and we are getting good devotees, sincere devotees. All parts of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> In choosing a master you mentioned that the choice is yours, but you have to know what you are after. For instance, if you are after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our offer is you surrender to God. Now it is you choice, whether you want to surrender not. That is you business. We are offering everyone that you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, or God. Kṛṣṇa also says the same thing, "You surrender to Me," and we are asking, "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa." The business is the same, there is no change, as it is. Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender to Me," we say, "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa." There is no difference. As it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ali:</span> My question was how could one choose when he himself is ignorant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By knowledge. Here is knowledge. You have not surrendered to God, you take the knowledge from God that "You surrender to Me." That is knowledge. Why don't you take it? Where is the question of ignorance? You may be in ignorance, but when the knowledge comes directly, that "You surrender to Me," then you can do it. Just like a man is fallen in a dark well. He's crying, "Save me, save me," and one man drops a rope, "Please catch it, I'll save you." If you don't catch, then whose fault it is? Kṛṣṇa comes directly, <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> and He says, "Do it." If you don't do it, then whose fault it is? It is your fault. You don't catch it. Kṛṣṇa says, "Here is the rope, catch it," then whose fault is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Excuse me, once you surrender to God, will you still have to look for an authority to guide you, or Kṛṣṇa helps you to find Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa is giving direction, but we have no such intelligence. Therefore Kṛṣṇa advises:</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> But is it possible to understand Kṛṣṇa directly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You can if you are intelligent enough. Otherwise, everyone can take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He says directly everyone.

If you understood, you have done it immediately. But you do not understand. Therefore Kṛṣṇa-<span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā upadekṣyanti</span> [Bg. 4.34]-you have to understand through the person who <span class="Italic">tatva-darśinaḥ,</span> who has seen Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tattva-darśi,</span> not theoretical. You have to approach such person, then he will show you, "Here is Kṛṣṇa." But if you don't follow the instruction in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> directly or indirectly.... Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> if you do not do that and because you may not understand Kṛṣṇa.... But Kṛṣṇa also says <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena...</span> You do not go to a seer, then how you'll understand Kṛṣṇa? You do not understand directly or indirectly. Then you are hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> If you don't understand Kṛṣṇa directly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither indirectly. If you don't understand directly, you should go to a person who understands Kṛṣṇa. But if you don't do either of these things, then how you'll understand Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> But how to, because in India there's so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don' talk of India; at any place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Any place, yes. But how do we be sure that this person knows Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> How can she be sure that the spiritual master is bona fide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If when you see that he does not speak anything except Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">tattva-darśi.</span> If you are expert businessman in certain line, you have no other business than to talk with on that line. Suppose if you are to purchase some gold, then you have to go to the gold market for dealing with gold. Why should we go to the ice market? That is your ignorance. If you want to know Kṛṣṇa, then you have to know from the persons who are dealing with Kṛṣṇa. That's all. They have no other business. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are dealing with Kṛṣṇa. That's all. We're writing books, so many books for Kṛṣṇa. We are preaching and going country to country. We simple deal with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore the movement is known as "Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Somebody suggested "Why don't you write 'God consciousness'?" No, if I say "God consciousness," they'll bring so many gods. It is very simple. If we take it seriously, then benefit is there. But if we hesitate, it is our misfortune.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">To understand Kṛṣṇa is not a joke. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu</span>-out of millions and millions of persons, <span class="Italic">kaścid yatati siddhaye,</span> one may try for perfection of life.

So to understand Kṛṣṇa is not so easy job. But Kṛṣṇa personally comes and teaches about Himself, and still if we do not take, that is our misfortune. If we still interpret, misinterpret rather, then it is our misfortune. What can be done? We should, those who are Indians, <span class="Italic">Bhāratavarsi,</span> we have got a particular duty. <span class="Italic">Bhārata bhūmite haila manuṣya janma yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has taken birth as a human being in India, he should make his life perfect and distribute the knowledge. So you are outside India, you make your life perfect and distribute this knowledge. This is the duty of Indians. Why outside India they should remain in darkness? Distribute the knowledge. But unless you make your life perfect, how you can distribute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Takes very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Very easy, provided you want to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> But takes long time to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No long time, I say a moment. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You do it. You can do it in a moment, but you'll not do it. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Yes, we are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do it immediately, but unfortunately you'll not do it. What can be done? There is a story, I may narrate it. One poor man was begging on the street, and Lord Śiva and Pārvatī was passing as ordinary man. So Pārvatī requested Lord Śiva that this poor man, he's asking, he's begging, so requested him, "Why don't you give him something?" And Lord Śiva replied, "Even if I give, he'll not be able to enjoy it. He's so unfortunate." "Oh, that we shall see. Why don't you give?" So Lord Śiva, in a watermelon, gave him, say, one thousand dollars. "You take this watermelon." So he thanked him, and after that he thought "What I shall do with this watermelon?" So another man came, "Sir, if you take this watermelon and give me one anna." So he gave one anna and he took it. Because he had no good fortune to take that money within the watermelon. Our fortune is like that. Kṛṣṇa is giving us the final benefit, but we are not taking care of. This is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> It is knowledge, that we don't have the knowledge, or enlightenment that in that watermelon there is something which is worth, or it is only that we don't want to do it, or we don't want to take the trouble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That chance is there. You can take the watermelon and cut it, but before that doing if you give it to somebody else, that is your misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> No, fortune is something which we say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am talking of misfortune. That the perfect knowledge is being distributed by Kṛṣṇa, but we are so misfortunate we do not take it. That is my fault. Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Misfortune is again, is not in the hands of human being.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, misfortune is your creation. Fortune... Man is the architect of his own fortune. So you can create your fortune and misfortune. That is the world, going on, so many people, they are working, somebody is creating fortune, somebody is creating misfortune. So anyway, when Kṛṣṇa directly is giving you the knowledge, perfect knowledge, why don't you take it? Is it not misfortune?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sahani:</span> Well, that probably is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> THat is misfortune. Ignorance means misfortune. The unfortunate persons are those who are ignorant, uneducated. Therefore you have to take education to become fortunate. And that education is being imparted by Kṛṣṇa, but you don't take it. That is misfortune. If you take education from Kṛṣṇa, you become fortunate. So why don't you take it? Kṛṣṇa has said this very thing.</div>

State says, "Everyone go to the university, be educated," but if you make your choice, go to the prison house, you can make your choice.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Well, they were not even Kṛṣṇa conscious people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Kauravas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kaurava, oh. Yes. No, not that they are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they may be. That's all right. My business is to execute what Kṛṣṇa says. That's all. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti. </span></div>

<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam ānukūlyena kṛṣṇanu<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Brs.<span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]. We have to act to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> We cannot make our choice, that "This is good, this is bad." Whatever Kṛṣṇa says is all right. Then it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Arjuna proposed that "Kṛṣṇa, why shall I fight with my brothers? After all, they are my brothers. They are enjoying the kingdom. Let them enjoy. I shall better live by begging. Why shall I fight with them?" It is a very good proposal, very gentlemanlike. But Kṛṣṇa said, "No, you must fight." <span class="Italic">Kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame samupasthitam anārya-juṣṭam-</span>"You're talking like <span class="Italic">anārya.</span> Fight."

And when he understood that "Kṛṣṇa wants it," he said, "Yes"-<span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Yes." So we cannot discriminate what is good or bad. We have to act according to the order of Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. But you cannot do independently also. When Kṛṣṇa orders, you do it. And Kṛṣṇa will order when you are faithful servant. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam. </span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> When one person surrenders to God, to Lord Kṛṣṇa, so does <span class="Italic">māyā</span> automatically vāṇīsh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> If I say, I pray to God, "O Lord Kṛṣṇa, I surrender unto You." So is..., <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not touch me? I will not be affected by this material infection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you fully surrender, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not touch you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> How one surrenders? What is meaning of surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender as He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān...</span> You have nothing to do. You have simply to do what Kṛṣṇa says. That is surrender. You cannot reserve anything, that "I do it something for me and something for Kṛṣṇa." That is not surrender. You have nothing to do except what Kṛṣṇa says. That is surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> If that is surrender, means I now surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, it's not surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> Only saying is not surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to act, become active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> So one who has surrendered, what is his thinking and acting, how he lives in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's active only on Kṛṣṇa's business. That's all. He has no other business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> So he does no other work. He does only what Kṛṣṇa has said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> Preaching and this and that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just like we are doing. Kṛṣṇa said, "Surrender unto Me." And what we are preaching? We are preaching, "Sir, you surrender to Kṛṣṇa." So what is the difficulty? Is there any difficulty? Kṛṣṇa said "Surrender unto Me." And if I go to you "Mr. Sharma, you surrender to Kṛṣṇa." So what is my difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> Suppose I want to surrender to God, to Kṛṣṇa. How I will do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, first of all my position, because I am working on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me." So if I say that "Sir, you surrender to Kṛṣṇa," so where is my difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> You see, yes, I say I surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You surrender, not surrender, that is you business. But my business is that I am requesting you that you surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So where is my difficulty? You surrender, not, that is your business. But my business is to canvass, "Sir, you surrender to Kṛṣṇa." So I am representing. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> I have to be recognized by Kṛṣṇa. That is my business. So if I do agree, then I become recognized by Kṛṣṇa. You do or not do, that is your business. My only business is to request you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> That I should surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But if you accept it, it is good for you; you don't accept it, that is your misfortune. But my business is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sharma:</span> So fortune comes very much into it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fortune you create. Man is the architect of his own fortune. If you don't accept Kṛṣṇa's advice, then unfortunate. But my business is not difficult. We are simply going door to door and asking, "Sir, you become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa." If he is inquisitive, "How can I become?" "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." So where is my difficulty? Haven't got to pay you something. I simply carry the message of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> "He's My most beloved person, who does this." So why shall I give up this simple job and become recognized by Kṛṣṇa? It is very simple thing. That is the advice of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> "All of you become guru and deliver these persons where you live." So how can I become guru? I have no education, I have no knowledge. No, no. You haven't got to-<span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> "You go and simply instruct him what Kṛṣṇa has said, you become guru." So Kṛṣṇa has said, "Surrender unto Me," I say "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa," I become guru. Even though I am a fool number one, I become guru, because I am repeating what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all. I don't require any education. Very simple thing. Everyone can become guru if he simply repeats what Kṛṣṇa has said, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> So it seems that to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, the first thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless he surrenders, how he can say others to surrender? Unless one has fully surrendered, if he says to others, "You surrender," that has no meaning. He must have surrendered. Then he can say to others, "You surrender." Unless he has surrendered, how he can take up this business, go door to door and say, "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa, you surrender to Kṛṣṇa"? That means he has surrendered. He has no other business. And what I am doing? I am doing the same thing. I have not given any bribe to these Europeans, Americans, or the anyone. No bribe, no show of gold manufacture. I simply say this, "You just become devotee of Kṛṣṇa." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Chanting Kṛṣṇa's name is very essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the easiest way. By chanting <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa,</span> you are associating with Kṛṣṇa. Because Kṛṣṇa is absolute, so Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's name, no difference. Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's name, Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's quality, everything, absolute. So chanting of Kṛṣṇa's name means you are associating with Kṛṣṇa. So if you are associating with Kṛṣṇa, then gradually you become Kṛṣṇa-ite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Sahani:</span> Creates the desire to get knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, <span class="Italic">paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam, ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</span> Just like if you remain in touch with the fire, certainly you become warm. So if you remain always in touch with Kṛṣṇa, then you become Kṛṣṇized. Very easy. You haven't gone to the forest or Himalaya or meditate. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is recommended in the <span class="Italic">śāstra: harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot perform any severe austerities, penance. Wherever you remain, you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And you become perfect. If not in one day... But you will become, if you continue chanting. And where is the difficulty? Where is the loss? And if there is some gain, why don't you try it? That is intelligence. I am not losing anything by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. If there is any gain, why not chant? Huh? Why is the argument not to chant? There is no loss, but if there is any profit, why don't you try to take it. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> recommends. Kṛṣṇa recommends, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So everything is there. If we don't misinterpret and take as it is, then we'll benefit. That is fortune. If somebody has one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees and if he does not utilize it, then he is unfortunate. And if he's fortunate he can utilize it, he can make it millions of dollars. So the knowledge is already there, you haven't go to manufacture or speculate. You take it, you become perfect. We are preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we don't manufacture anything. Here is this knowledge, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> just take it. Already it is there, everything. We haven't got to manufacture something, concoct something. Everything is there. You refer, you get knowledge, and be fortunate. <span class="Italic">Prasādam?</span></div>

Why should you remain misfortunate? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sukṛtino 'rjuna. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna. Sukṛtino</span> means fortunate.
