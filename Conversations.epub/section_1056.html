<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He asks how many pages. Yogānanda asks how many... Because they say that you sent a newsletter to all the GBCs. He asks how many pages was the newsletter. And I said just two lines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Newspaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Newsletter to the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that newsletter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You said, "Please be informed that Nitāi has become a venomous serpent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this has been sent? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, to the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yogānanda asked how many pages, when he heard about the newsletter. He thought that you spoke so long about that. And I just said, "Just two lines." But they never asked me what the letter said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, two lines is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> <span class="Italic">Punar muṣaka bhava. Punar muṣaka bhava.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is exactly the same case. <span class="Italic">Punar muṣaka bhava,</span> you know the whole story? A <span class="Italic">muṣaka,</span> a mouse, was made a tiger, and the tiger wanted to eat the saintly person who made him. First of all he was mouse. So he came to the saintly person. "Sir, I am troubled. Give me some benediction." "What do you want?" "Now, the cat always chases." "All right, you become cat so that you'll not be attacked." Then after some time he came. "I am being chased by the dog." "All right, you become a dog." From cat to dog, from mouse to... Then again he came. "Still, they are chasing me. Fox." And then in this way, and ultimately he made a tiger. And after becoming a tiger, he began to look, staring on the... "What do you mean by this?" "I shall eat you." "Oh? You become again a mouse." (laughter) Again he became mouse. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The perfect example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Now he looks like dirty. You know, like brown. The <span class="Italic">dhotī's</span> not white. It's like brownish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He harassed. "He has not increased my..." Hearing and hearing, he wants to go. So why not, if he found some real disciplic succession, some <span class="Italic">bābājī,</span> why he did not remain there? He is criticizing that our is not in the proper succession. So why he did not remain where he found the proper succession? Why he's sometimes in Vṛndāvana, sometimes Delhi, sometimes here. Why he is loitering? Crazy. Unfortunate. Unnecessarily picking out some trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Faultfinding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">bābājīs,</span> they are against anything preaching. They are very, very much against preaching. So I am preaching. <span class="Italic">Bābājīs,</span> the Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> and all of them, their idea is that I am ruining this <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> and Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> This is the propaganda. What I am writing, they are all wrong. And they are making... And they try to poison my disciples as far as possible so that the whole institution may be poisoned and break. This is their propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was one thing that Nitāi put in his letter, that the teachings of ISKCON are completely opposite or contradictory to what is actually in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now he has become tiger. He wants to kill that philosophy. When he did not know anything he came to us. Now he has become learned, he wants to criticize. The same philosophy. "You have made me tiger, now I can see you are my eatable." (laughs) He could not find out any other eatable. "I shall eat you." The rascal. What can be done? (end)</div>
