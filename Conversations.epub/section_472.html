<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Your people have a serenity that many western people don't have. What, what is the secret of serenity? And is it... I gather you reject many material demands, materialism as such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender is not material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Serenity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> To what do you attribute this serenity that your devotees have, their calmness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The devotees seem to be calm, serene. Where does that come from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> From what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness, when one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Ah, the consciousness, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā.</span> These are the proofs. <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, then he becomes qualified with all godly attributes. That I have explained, that if you be in touch with God, then you become godly. That is the test. Simply by saying that "I am in commune with God." No. There is test. The test means if he is always in touch with God, he'll become, in his characteristics, godly. So they... One of the qualifications is serenity. Is one of the qualifications. There are twenty-five qualifications of a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Twenty-five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> What are some of the others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have you got the list?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Friendly... Uh, it's in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Right here, <span class="Italic">Teachings of...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> I don't... I believe, obviously, you would have ways, methods of becoming God conscious, Kṛṣṇa conscious. What...? Sort of a meditation? Chanting? Or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is practical. What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> (Reading) It says, "There are many such qualities. Lord Caitanya described some of them. A devotee of the Lord is always kind to everyone. He does not..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First qualification. He is very kind to everyone. Yes. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "He does not pick a quarrel with anyone. He takes the essence of life, spiritual life. He is equal to everyone. No one can find fault in a devotee. His magnanimous mind is always fresh and clean, without material obsessions. He is a benefactor to all living entities. He is peaceful. He is always surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. He has no material desire. He is very humble. He is fixed in his direction. He is victorious over the six material qualities, such as lust and anger. He does not eat more than what he needs. He is always sane. He is respectful to others, but for himself he does not require any respect. He is grave. He is merciful. He is friendly. He is a poet. He is an expert, and he is silent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Well, they're all very good, aren't they? (laughs) And so in reading about Lord Kṛṣṇa, I take it that He performed many miracles of healing. I'm very interested in spiritual healing because in my ministry here in Australia I've been twenty-nine years in the Harley Streets, the streets of doctors. I'm now in Colin (?) Street. I was in McQuarrie Street in Sydney. And in Sydney I had forty-one medical men on, and women, mainly men on my role of members, and we work very closely. This very day I've been working closely with a doctor with a certain patient who's having what is called a nervous breakdown. And we, over the years, have spent a lot of time with spiritual healing. Now, do you yourself practice spiritual healing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm, no. Practically, we have very little suffering from disease. The devotees... We are spending so much money, but we don't spend for doctors' bill. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Well, normal doctors, but now, we explain to our patients that the doctor normally works with the physical level, and the psychiatrist works with the emotional mental level, but the church works with the spiritual level. And just as Jesus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual level means to cure his material disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The material disease is birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> I'm sorry. I don't quite follow that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said the real disease is the material condition in which we have to suffer birth, death, disease and old age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these things can be overcome by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Umm... Yes, I see. On the point of reading... In this very interesting magazine and this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You find out this verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> There was a reference to something you said about plants having a feeling. Some years ago I carried out an experiment at the request of one of our magazines in praying for plants and seeds growing and so on, and there seemed to be a relationship between these prayers for the plants and the opposite, in a negative way, against the plants. And I didn't have an opportunity to carry it out too far, much, but in two experiments, there was apparently a clear indication that the plants responded to prayer. And the peas and the beans in particular, (laughs) there was a significant, a very significant increase in the plants that were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm. Find out. <span class="Italic">Jarā-maraṇa-mokṣāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Satsvarūpa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">jarā-maraṇa-mokṣāya<br class="calibre2"/>mām āśritya yatanti ye<br class="calibre2"/>te brahma tad viduḥ kṛtsnam<br class="calibre2"/>adhyātmaṁ karma cākhilam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Intelligent persons who are endeavoring for liberation from old and death, take refuge in Me in devotional service. They are actually Brahman because they entirely know everything about transcendental and fruitive activities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> What does devotional service mean in that context?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "Purport: Birth, death, old age and diseases affect this material body, but not the spiritual body. There is no birth, death, old age and disease for the spiritual body, so one who attains a spiritual body, becomes one of the associates of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and engages in eternal devotional service, is really liberated. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:</span> I am spirit. It is said that one should understand that he is Brahman-spirit soul. This Brahman conception of life is also in devotional service, as described in this verse. The pure devotees are transcendentally situated on the Brahman platform, and they know everything about transcendental and material activities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> "Transcendental" means spiritual, does it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> As opposed to material. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are always engaged in transcendental devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Always. Then they'll be freed from birth, death, old age and disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> And... Were the papers correct in reporting you as... Well, they reported opposite things that... But you, of course, hold to transmigration, I gather. And this is... Death really doesn't happen. It's a change of form. Is that it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as the..., everyone dies, so a devotee, after death, in his transcendental form, he goes, back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Thank you. I take it from what you've just been saying, Your Grace, that this explains what is said here in the..., referring to illicit sex as being anything that's not in marriage and not for procreation within marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only, the sex allowed only for begetting nice children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> You don't feel that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And beyond that, sex, that is illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> And that is out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> What is your attitude to Jesus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have already explained in the meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We, we respect him as transcendental representative of God, son of God. Yes. He's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Is there some sort of relationship with Lord Kṛṣṇa? I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is relationship. He's coming from Kṛṣṇa. He... Jesus the Christ. Christ means Christo or Kristo or Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes? Hm. Another thing. We, of course, have been impressed by the number of young Australians who have become interested in the Hare Krishna Movement and we really congratulate you, sir, on the very fine work (Prabhupāda chuckles) that you've done, and the ones who have rescued the ladies from the fire the other day. But I think everybody recognizes that they're most sincere, that they're not involved because they're not being blessed. They feel they're getting something out of it. But how do you explain... I gather that most countries, in Britain and America and so on that there are many thousands...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Africa. In China, in Japan. Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> And now, how do you explain this? Why are people...? Why are...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are on the spiritual platform, they forget the material designation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> They're mostly young people, aren't they, or are they, you have all ages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, young, young people, they have got brain, (Reverend Powell laughs) receptive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes, yes, rightly. And I might also inquire... I take it that you feel... Forgive me if I'm not using the right expression, but the caste system is written into the law of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, we have no caste system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Well, I'm sorry. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and so on, <span class="Italic">per se.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is qualification. This is a division according to... Find out the <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Your base there is in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My birthplace is in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Calcutta, ah. I was there many years ago, I knew...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have been in Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes, I have. I crossed from Karachi and Delhi, I went down to Agra, and I gather this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for people coming from England to Australia, they passed through Calcutta or Bombay, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> That's right. Yes. We came by air. Was there some reference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Verse">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tasya kartāram api māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viddhy akartāram avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me, and although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The Lord is the creator of everything. Everything is born of Him, everything is sustained by Him, and everything, after annihilation, rests in Him. He is therefore the creator of the four divisions of the social order, beginning with the intelligent class of men, technically called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas </span>due to their being situated in the mode of goodness. Next is the administrative class, technically called the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas </span>due to their being situated in the mode of passion. The mercantile men, called the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span>, are situated in the mixed modes of passion and ignorance, and the <span class="Italic">śūdras, </span>or laborer class, are situated in the ignorant mode of material nature. In spite of His creating the four divisions of human society, Lord Kṛṣṇa does not belong to any of these divisions, because He is not one of the conditioned souls, a section of whom form human society. Human society is similar to any other animal society, but to elevate men from the animal status, the abovementioned divisions are created by the Lord for the systematic development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The tendency of a particular man toward work is determined by the modes of material nature which he has acquired. Such symptoms of life, according to different modes of material nature, are described in the Eighteenth Chapter of this book. A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, however, is above even the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, </span>because a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa </span>by quality is supposed to know about Brahman, the Supreme Absolute Truth. Most of them approach the impersonal Brahman manifestation of Lord Kṛṣṇa, but only a man who transcends the limited knowledge of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa </span>and reaches the knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, becomes a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness-or, in other words, a <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava. </span>Kṛṣṇa consciousness includes knowledge of all different plenary expansions of Kṛṣṇa, namely Rāma, Nṛsiṁha, Varāha, etc. However, as Kṛṣṇa is transcendental to this system of the four divisions of human society, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness is also transcendental to all divisions of human society, whether we consider the divisions of community, nation or species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Thank you. The first part of that made me think of Jesus' parable about the talents, that some get two talents, and some get five and some ten. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Come on. Sit down. Thank you. Oh, it is very nice. (handles paper wrapping) You can close the door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Close the door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So all our disciples, they are young men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes, I noticed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are receptive. And their intelligence is intact. Old man takes time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> (laughs) Yes, well, that's very true, sir. Your Grace, what's the parable of the talents, that some were given a few, and some were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the talents are described. Find that Eighteenth Chapter, <span class="Italic">śamo damas titikṣā.</span> Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> What I'd like [break] I'd like to hear this, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Talents are divided into three categories: the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> category, and the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> category, the <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> category and the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> category. They are described here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> And this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the qualifications of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Symptoms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śamo damas tapaḥ śaucaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kṣāntir ārjavam eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-karma svabhāva-jam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.42]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is first quality man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Well, there's a great similarity, isn't there, to the fruits of the holy spirit in the New Testament, with these qualities you've just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. When, when one is qualified with all these attributes and he acts accordingly, then he is first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes. I gather when you had this interview with the professor in Moscow that there was a little bit of adjustment needed. What is your view of communism, Your Grace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Communism, the idea is nice. But they are imperfect. Imperfect. Their philosophy is that everything belongs to the state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is imperfect idea. Our philosophy is everything belongs to God. So unless they come to this conclusion, they'll remain imperfect. The equal distribution of wealth, everything belongs to God-that is very good idea. But if it is limited within certain area... Just like the communistic state. Besides that, this is imperfect in the sense, they have no idea who are nationals. Not only they, even the capitalists. National means those who are born in that particular land. So there are animals also. They are also national. But because they are imperfect, either the communists or capitalists, they do not accept the animals as nationals. They are sent to the slaughterhouse. These things are happening because they are imperfect. They have no God conscious views. They have crippled views. They are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Thank you. Your Grace, I was in Moscow, many years ago now. And everywhere I went in Russia, well right down to Stalingrad, as it was called then. They said, "This society is based on the principle, 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need.' " Now, I felt that in principle that was a very fine thing because it's based on the parable of the talents and the parable of what we call the penny wage, the same wage is paid to all however long they work because they all have the same need, really. That principle, I think, is a Christian principle, I mean from that point of view it is. But I see what you were saying earlier...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The principles, as they are stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is not limited within Christian or communist or capitalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The principle... Wherever there are these talented persons, he is to be considered as first class man. He does not say that "If it is found among the Hindus or amongst the Christians..." No. Anywhere. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> These <span class="Italic">guṇa,</span> these modes of material nature, is all-pervasive. So even in India they protest. Because I am making them <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> My disciples, they're offered sacred thread. They're regularly made into <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So the Indians, in India, they're very conservative, perverted. So they accuse that "Swami Mahārāja is spoiling the Hindu system of religion, because he's accepting <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> from outside." So actually they're also not aware... Creation of God... Here God says that "I have created." So God's creation is not limited. Suppose the sun is creation of God. It is not for India or for Australia. It is for everyone. So whatever created by God, that is not monopoly of a certain class of men. Yes. This is the idea. So these people, they do not know what is the meaning of a Vaiṣṇava or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is not limited with a certain circle or certain country or certain society. Just like Christ says, "Thou shalt not kill." This is applicable to every man. Not only that the Christians should follow. Unfortunately, Christians, they do not follow. They are killing. So how there can be religious life? Unless you follow the rules and regulations given by the authority, then where is the meaning of becoming within that community?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And God or God's representative, whatever they say, that is not meant for a limited area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not. Either you take Christian principle or Hindu principle, what is real principle, really principle, that is applicable everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Christ said that "Thou should be, one should be meek and humble to go to, back to home, back to..." Eh? It is not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Yeah. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not limited within the Christian community. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reverend Powell:</span> Well, it's a great privilege to talk with you, Your Grace. And, uh, you must be tired, you've got a big day tomorrow. I'm mustn't keep you. If I may.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just here, please wait. Little, take little. Bring that sweetball. Sit down please, one minute. You have been today there today in meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. I appreciated it very much. It was very nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were all present?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are negative of vegetarian and non-vegetarian. We are not vegetarian, neither non-vegetarian. We eat Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Rather, <span class="Italic">"prasādarian.</span>" We are neither vegetarian, nor non-vegetarian. Because we don't eat which is not offered to Kṛṣṇa. Things are prepared according to the order of Kṛṣṇa, and when Kṛṣṇa eats, we take the remnants of foodstuff. Therefore we do not fall in the group of vegetarian or non-vegetarian. We are transcendental.</div>
