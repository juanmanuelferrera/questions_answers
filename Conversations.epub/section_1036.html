<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should we bother about this and that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Prabhupāda, you wrote in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> that the <span class="Italic">Caitanya mahā-mantra, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda,</span> there is no offense to that. And so therefore in the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> it is actually more beneficial...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Offense is that what is spoken by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> if you do not follow, that is offense. <span class="Italic">Guror avajñā.</span> That is offense. To chant Gaura-Nitāi is no offense. But if our previous <span class="Italic">gurus</span> have chanted <span class="Italic">śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita</span>-why should we go beyond that? That is <span class="Italic">guror avajñā.</span> Even there is no aparādha, because guru, Kavirāja Gosvāmī, has sung like that and my <span class="Italic">guru</span> has sung, we should follow that. We should not make any deviation. That is <span class="Italic">guror avajñā śruti-śāstra-nindanam. Nāmno balād yasya hi pāpa-buddhiḥ.</span> So it comes to be one of the items of the <span class="Italic">daśa-vidha-aparādha. Guror avajñā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Should we consider that it's more beneficial for people to hear <span class="Italic">bhaja śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? There is already... Why should you go here and there? There is already <span class="Italic">śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda.</span> Why you are so anxious to go out of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> No, I'm saying is it more beneficial for people to hear that <span class="Italic">mantra</span> than the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Is it more beneficial for people to hear the <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva mantra</span> than the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. You are going to Hare Kṛṣṇa through Nitāi-Gaura. <span class="Italic">Nitāiyer karuṇā habe braje rādhā-kṛṣṇa pābe.</span> The principle is don't try to manufacture. Because you are not experienced. So what nonsense you will manufacture, that will be offensive. Better go on, the simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I know one devotee that chants <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva mantra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them chant whatever. We shall chant like this, <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva-śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya prabhu nityānanda śrī-advaita gadādhara śrīvāsādi-gaura-bhakta-vṛnda.</span> I've explained that. Five features of Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He chants that <span class="Italic">mantra</span> on his beads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That boy Richard in Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal. That is his bad association. Therefore I say don't follow these so-called Rādhā-kuṇḍa <span class="Italic">bābājīs. Nara-kuṇḍa bābājī.</span> And they smoke <span class="Italic">biḍi.</span> I have seen. Richard is still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. He's in very bad health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he has got money. Spending money there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I haven't been there for a long time, but I just heard about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has got money. How he is spending?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He has hundreds of thousands of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Probably in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he does not bring that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, he has money all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Dhanañjaya prabhu, he went to see him and he said he was dying. He's supposed to pass off. And he said that he had written a will and on the will he had left most of his money to ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> He loves you very much. Actually, he's very attracted to you Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Why does he not come to us? He likes Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> He loves Rādhā-kuṇḍa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Determination. No, if he's in difficulty he may come. We can take care of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I go tomorrow to Delhi and I'll leave to go to Istanbul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Go with the blessings of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.</span> Very good. Kṛṣṇa will save you. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and depend on Kṛṣṇa. Then everything's all right. Don't be afraid that you are going to foreign country. There is no foreign country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Kṛṣṇa's everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idam</span>-everything's Kṛṣṇa's. <span class="Italic">Mārobi rākhobi jo icchā tohārā.</span> Surrender means that. "Kṛṣṇa, I have surrendered to You. Now if You like You can protect me. If you like You can kill me. Whatever you like, do." That's all. <span class="Italic">Mārobi rākhobi jo icchā tohārā nitya-dāsa prati tuwā adhikārā.</span> "I am your eternal servant. You have got full right. Either you kill me or protect me, that is your business. But I surrender." <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> This is surrender. <span class="Italic">Mārobi rākhobi jo icchā tohārā.</span> This is surrender. If you put me into inconvenience, then I'm not going to surrender. That is conditional. (laughs) Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says whatever you like you can do. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching. <span class="Italic">Āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām marma-hatāṁ karotu vā adarśanān, yathā tathā vā vidadhātu</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.47]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whatever you like you do. <span class="Italic">Yathā tathā vā. Yathā tathā,</span> whatever you like. It is up to you. I don't object. <span class="Italic">Yathā tathā vā vidadhātu lampaṭo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If one is not a very strong devotee, should one have that same attitude of going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vrata.</span> That is perfection. <span class="Italic">Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, he's saying if you're not very fixed up then should you still go out and preach. If you're not very fixed up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody is fixed. Nobody is perfect. But by rendering service he becomes perfect. The more you render service you become perfect. Not that in one day you become perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because I remember you also said that preaching is not for neophytes. You also said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neophyte means that <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.</span> One worships the Deity very nicely but he does not like to do good to others. Neither he knows who is Vaiṣṇava. He's neophyte. He is, in the <span class="Italic">arcanā,</span> he's fixed up, he's doing very nicely. <span class="Italic">Arcāyām eva haraye.</span> <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śraddhā..., pūjāṁ yaḥ śraddhayehate na tad-bhakteṣu.</span> One does not understand who is <span class="Italic">bhakta. Na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu.</span> And how to do good to others. But he's doing the Deity worship very nicely. <span class="Italic">Sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ.</span> He's <span class="Italic">prākṛta.</span> But he can advance when his, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, he understands "Here is a Vaiṣṇava. Here is an innocent man. He should be given some enlightenment." That is preacher. When he'll feel for others. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. <span class="Italic">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa.</span> "I am thinking of these rascals who are averse to you." <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha-cetasa.</span> And that is Vaiṣṇava. Advanced devotee. For me I have no anxiety. <span class="Italic">Naivodvije para duratyaya-vai...</span> There may be so many dangers. I don't care for them. <span class="Italic">Naiva udvije.</span> "I am not disturbed by all these things." <span class="Italic">Udvije. Para duratyaya.</span> Even it is very insurmountable, dangerous position, I don't care. How? <span class="Italic">Tvad-vīrya-gāyana-mahāmṛta-magna-cittaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">."</span> Because when I think of You, chant of Your glories, I don't care for that." Then you appear to be morose? "Yes." Why? <span class="Italic">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa.</span> "I am thinking of these rascals who are averse to You. How to do... They are engaged in false activities, <span class="Italic">māyā-sukhāya,</span> for temporary happiness of the senses. So I am thinking like them. Therefore I am morose. For me I have no anxiety." And actually, what Prahlāda Mahārāja... He was thrown to the fire, he was thrown from the hill and underneath the... He didn't care. "Whatever you'll do I'll chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So how he'll be unhappy for himself? He has already passed all these examinations. His father! Not other. His own father. He's helpless. He's under father's care, and the father is giving so much trouble. All right, if he likes, go on. Everyone expects affection from the father. He's five years old boy. Where he will go? No, no, no, no. "I'll take shelter of Kṛṣṇa and you can go on with your business. I don't care for your punishment."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Such stage of <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is very rare, Prabhupāda. To be on such a high platform is very rare. To be fearless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> itself is rare. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not cheap. Don't think it is cheap commodity. There is a verse, I now forget. Kṛṣṇa can give you liberation, but He hesitates to give <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Muktiṁ dadāti karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Mukti,</span> He is prepared, "All right, take <span class="Italic">mukti." </span>But when there is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> He has to consider twice. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means he becomes in the grip of <span class="Italic">bhakta. Vedeṣu durlabham adurlabham ātma-bhaktau [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Are we doing <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">viddhi-bhakti.</span> And this is <span class="Italic">rāga-bhakti,</span> spontaneous. Through <span class="Italic">viddhi-bhakti</span> you have to come to the stage of <span class="Italic">rāga-bhakti. </span>Without <span class="Italic">viddhi-bhakti,</span> you'll not... Because you are conditioned. Those who are liberated, they immediately get <span class="Italic">rāga-bhakti.</span> Not by imitation. That is another thing. <span class="Italic">Nitya-siddha.</span> <span class="Italic">(Japa:)</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare Hare Rāma... So I have got all encouragement. Go and preach. Don't be afraid. Simply present, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whatever you have learned from Kṛṣṇa, from your <span class="Italic">guru,</span> just vomit it, that's all. There is no need of becoming very expert. Simply whatever you learned. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Lots of <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That is our main... Anyone will like. Chant <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, and give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and everyone will take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think puris and halavā<span class="Italic">,</span> there isn't a person in the world who doesn't like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anything you'll nicely prepare, tastefully, people will like. <span class="Italic">(Japa:)</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. You have learned cooking? I'm asking... Huh? What you have learned? What preparation you can make?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee :</span> Many different kinds of preparations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tell me something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Tell Prabhupāda some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Ah... Most of the kitchen preparations (indistinct) one gets in India. Iddlies (indistinct) ...things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he knows so many things. You have learned something? You?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Very little. I can cook halavā and puris. Simple things. I can cook sweet rice. Sweet rice I can cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sweet rice. That is very sweet for you. (laughs) The Europeans and Americans, they like sweet rice. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think they like halavā the best, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā</span>? If halavā is made nicely, actually it is best. So prepare all these things. Offer to Kṛṣṇa and devotees, and at last you take. Don't take first. Give all, as much as you like, then you take. <span class="Italic">Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam [Bg. 9.2].</span> It is such a nice movement. It is simply pleasing. To execute, it is simply pleasing. And <span class="Italic">avyayam.</span> Whatever you do is permanent. Whatever little service you have given. It will never be lost. <span class="Italic">Avyayam.</span> Therefore Nārada Muni says, <span class="Italic">bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi.</span> Even if he's not fully matured and falls down, <span class="Italic">kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kim.</span> Where is loss? Whatever he has done, that is permanent. Because that will grow. If the seed is permanently sown, then it will naturally grow. It may take some time, but it will grow. So he's not loser. If he's little careful, then it will grow. <span class="Italic">Mālī hañā sei bīja kare āropaṇa, śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye...</span> Then the creeper goes, grows, and at last takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa. These are described in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> When we prepare a feast we should give and give and give, and when no one wants any more then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up until he comes to this point. Not only this point, but up to this point. Eat as much as you like. We are not miser. You eat. As much you want I shall supply. But don't waste. Eat. Don't waste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This morning you were saying that fasting is very good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I was just thinking about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Not <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> I never said. No, those who want to eat... Fasting... One who has not developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for him fasting. And one who takes pleasure, "Oh, it is Kṛṣṇa's pleasure, or Kṛṣṇa's food. I'll take." This is the idea. So we are not devotees, therefore we should first fast. And those who are devotees, they'll take as much as they like. I was telling fasting because I am not a devotee. (laughs) For me fasting is good. If I eat more-<span class="Italic">atyāhāraḥ. Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca, ṣaḍbhir bhaktir praṇaśyati [NoI 2].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you can appreciate <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam</span> without filling up to the neck...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is for the devotee. A devotee can eat. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu was eating. Govinda, his servant complained, "Sir, so many things are lying here and everyone asks, 'Whether Caitanya Mahāprabhu has taken my preparation.' 'Oh yes, He has taken.' So I have to speak so many lies. You don't take. What can I do?" He said, "All right, bring it. Bring it." So He began to eat for one hundred men's foodstuff stocked. He finished. Then He asked, "Any more?" So, now only the bags are there. Everything finished. (laughs) So He ate. Everything, one after another, one after another, one after another. "All right. Bring, bring, bring." So He can eat. We cannot. This water is going there? It is going only one side and not other side? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it a sign of advancement in devotional service...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Branch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Advancement. If somebody wants to preach. Is that the sign of advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's the first sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When one is very anxious to preach, that is advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And if one is not very anxious to preach, he is not very advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he should stick to Deity worship very nicely. Following the rules and regulations, cleansing. <span class="Italic">Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau **.</span> This <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> you take very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And then when he becomes advanced....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Automatically he will be anxious to preach. Automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Ultimately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not ultimately. Automatically. Just like in a small time, our, that Kṛṣṇa dāsa? He knows English, he knows French, he knows... What does it mean? He has heard it. Now he'll want to speak. That is the natural sequence. If anyone has listened from the authority about Kṛṣṇa, he wants to speak again. That is preaching. Not that "I have listened about Kṛṣṇa, that's all right." No. When he wants to speak to others, that is advancement. That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.</span> That is the test that he has advanced. <span class="Italic">Nāma, rūpa, guṇa, līlā</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Does he have to speak immediately, or he can speak after some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not immediately. Immediately how you can speak. Unless he knows, what he'll speak? It is better not to speak than speaking all nonsense. He must learn first of all what is the philosophy, what is the science. Then he can speak. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span>. These Turks are <span class="Italic">yavanas?</span> Demons and <span class="Italic">yavanas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Materially there are so many divisions, but spiritual they are all servant of Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is <span class="Italic">yavana,</span> nobody is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Everyone is servant of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">. </span>We are going there not to make the <span class="Italic">yavanas</span> a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is not our mission. Our business is... We know that he is servant of Kṛṣṇa. Forgetting Kṛṣṇa, he's thinking himself as Turkish, as Muhammadan, as Jewish, as Christian. This is his disease. So let me cure his disease. Why he should be called <span class="Italic">yavana?</span> That is artificial. He's Kṛṣṇa dāsa. <span class="Italic">Jivera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like when a physician treats a patient, does he think that here is a Christian, here is a Muhammadan, here is a Hindu? He takes as patient. Never mind what he is. And he gives treatment. He never thinks that here is a Christian patient, here is a Muhammadan patient. He is patient. Give me this, bring him medicine. That is physician's business. Why should we consider, "Here is a Christian patient. He should be treated differently than the Muhammadan." Does he think like that? Does he think? Does any physician honestly think that "Here is a Christian patient, special care should be taken for him?" No. If he is physician, he should give the equal treatment to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If he doesn't have any money he may... (end)</div>
