<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 21, 1973, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> His name is Harvey Cox, and he's at Harvard University, and his books are read by millions of people. As soon as one of his books comes out, everybody looks. So in this new book, his basic thesis is that God is especially interested to the causes of the poor people, and the poor people are much closer to God than anyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> I was wondering if Your Divine Grace would like to comment on such a thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Another very prominent... He's a psychiatrist and a theologian. His name is Menninger. So about ten years ago he wrote a book that the conception of sin and evil was unnecessary, and one should give up considering that some things are sins. Now he just wrote a book saying that he was wrong, that since he has promoted this theory everyone is degrading, and that the theory of sin and evil should be maintained to keep the people in good order.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these rascals will change every year their theology. So what is the value of their words? Childish. [break] ...changes, he is a rascal. That is our... We say, "Kṛṣṇa the Supreme." We never change it. And "Surrender is the only process." We shall never change it. In any circumstance we will not change it. That is the difference. And these rascals will change every year their opinion. They are rascals. [break] ...They are rascals. [break] Kṛṣṇa said that "I am the Supreme." So Arjuna accepted, the Supreme. All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> accepted the Supreme. Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted, Supreme. My Guru Mahārāja accepted, Supreme. I am accepting, Supreme. I am teaching the same thing. So there is no change. Not that after a few years it will be changed. That never be. That is our position. [break] Changing means material. Anything material is susceptible to change. Like this material body. I am changing my body, but I am the spirit soul. I am not changing. That is the difference. So all these so-called theologicians, they have no idea what is spiritual knowledge. All rascals. They cannot understand what is God. That I have explained. Simply speculating. It will not help. [break] (Hindi) (some Indian people have joined the walk) Now we are talking of one theologician. Some years ago just... Narrate the... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> This basic thesis of the leading theologian in our country... He's saying that the poor people are closer to God and God is specifically looking on their cause more than anyone else. He's at Harvard University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the one thing is, who is poor? Admitting. We admit, of course, that God is specially interested with the fallen or degraded. But first thing is that who is fallen? Who is poor? That is to be ascertained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> But there is one more thing. I don't think God could be so partial that He would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God cannot be partial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...that he would look only to the poor. But as there is a saying in Hindi that (Hindi) So they say, "When a man is poor, and he is miserable, then he remembers more God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Not necessarily. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna, ārto arthārthī</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 7.16]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one is distressed he remembers God, if he is pious. If he is not pious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then he won't remember. Then he will curse him. Then he will curse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is correct. But even a pious man in prosperity, he doesn't think of God so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is pious, then in his distress, he will remember God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, but a pious man in his prosperity sometimes forgets, as Sugrīva had the tendency to forget and he had to be reminded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is very rarely. Sugrīva forgot. Anyway, there is chance of such thing because the distressed man, although he is pious, as soon as his distress is moved, then he forgets. There is such chance. Therefore <span class="Italic">ārto arthārthī jñānī jijñāsuḥ.</span> Four classes of men. So <span class="Italic">ārto arthārthī.</span> They, after benefiting by the grace of God, they may forget. But those who are <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> they will not forget. That is the difference. So these theologicians, they are changing their opinion. What is that, Karandhara, you said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, another very prominent psychiatrist and theologian, about ten years ago he wrote a very famous book wherein he said that people should give up the idea of evil and sin because it is just an inhibition on the mind. But now he just wrote another book saying that he was wrong, and since people have given up the idea of sin and evil, the whole world has degraded to such a bad state that now, even though there may not be a God, they should still believe in evil just to keep things in order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if there is no God, then who will judge what is evil and what is right? If there is no God? People are abiding the law, "Keep to the right, keep to the left," because they know, "Behind this order, there is government." If he does not keep the arrangement, then he will be punished. So as soon as you accept the principles of bad and good, then you have to accept God. Now, this kind of theologician, some years ago his opinion was something, and now his opinion is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think they keep on changing their opinion according to the world condition...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And when they see that the conditions and the things in the world as they are, they don't fit in with their theories, then they change their theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So they are opportunists. They are not learned scholar. Our proposition is that five thousand years ago Kṛṣṇa taught that "I am the Supreme." So Arjuna accepted, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma, paraṁ dhāma:</span> [Bg. 10.12] "Yes, You are Supreme." Then all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> later on, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, even Śaṅkarācārya, all accepted. "Yes," <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then after that, <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> system, Lord Caitanya accepted, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord." So after Caitanya, five hundred years, all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are accepting. So we are accepting or teaching the same thing. No change, no change. <span class="Italic">Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam.</span> If there is change, that is not <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> that is not <span class="Italic">śāśvata.</span> That is circumstantial. That is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. That is the difference between man-made law and... <span class="Italic">Nitya</span> and <span class="Italic">śāśvata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was coming here at six, but I caught cold. Therefore I have changed the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, six is a bit too early.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, too early. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...loving propensity, we want to love somebody, up to the dog, but we are not getting satisfaction because the love is placed in wrong place. But if you love Kṛṣṇa, then everything will be all right. [break]. If you pour water on the root, it reaches to all the branches, twigs, leaves, flowers, everything. [break] (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Disneyland, all sorts of shows and devices for children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So children's father also go there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> [break] She is also doing that <span class="Italic">japa.</span> And while this <span class="Italic">mālā,</span> doing <span class="Italic">mālā,</span> and doing the <span class="Italic">japa,</span> the mind doesn't remain fixed in God. You know, it wanders about. So what is the way of fixing the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To hear. "Hare Kṛṣṇa." Chant and hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Speak loudly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian lady):</span> Speak loudly but still the mind goes away here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is called... <span class="Italic">abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> That you have to practice. (Hindi) We have got a <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya,</span> that "You must perform so many times." It doesn't matter what is... Then gradually, (Hindi). This is the only...</div>

<div class="After-Verse">(Hindi) So we have to follow, and actually it is becoming effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think it takes many births to have the effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can have immediately, provided you follow the rules and regulations. That's all. Not many births, immediately. <span class="Italic">Tat-kṣaṇāt. Śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sadyo hṛdy avarudhyate śuśrūṣubhis tat-kṣaṇāt.</span> The <span class="Italic">tat-kṣaṇāt</span> means immediately. But one must very eager. That's all. That is the only qualification. Otherwise, Śukadeva Gosvāmī would not... Vyāsadeva would not have used this word, <span class="Italic">tat-kṣaṇāt,</span> immediately. I think that hill is Hollywood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Beverly Hills, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Beverly Hills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, that is Hollywood Hills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> If one isn't eager, how can he become eager, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By association. By association. Therefore this society. We are giving chance. You were not eager four years ago. Now why you are eager? You come to the Society and become eager, automatically. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> By <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> it becomes very pleasing to the ear and to the heart. And if you little try, then it becomes successful. But if it is so-called <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> professional, hired <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-</span>reader, then it will... Thousand, thousand years will no, not effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then it is merchandising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Merchandising. That is the... (Hindi) Each verse of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is volumes of philosophy, but neither they know it, neither they explain it. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-patha</span> means <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. that is what <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> has been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they will understand, <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It has been misrepresented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misrepresented. They will think that it is ordinary, just like young boy, young girls, they mix together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And that <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> is also not taken in that moral sense. It is more of a sex exploitation. That is how they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why one should go to the <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā?</span> It is in the Tenth Canto. And in the thirty-fifth chapter. So what is the purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. That is being misrepresented. That has also been taken as an enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It has been taken more as sense gratification.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Prabhupāda, what is the meaning of the word Śrīla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīla is... just like we say "Śrī" to the ordinary person. And Śrīla to very respectable person.</div>

Just like in Nairobi, I was refused permission. You see. We spent so much money, and they did not inform before. And when I was on the airport... That also, no written order. They said, "From higher authorities it is the order that you cannot enter." Just see. Kenya. So at the present moment we have got many enemies of this movement.

So then the people, they wouldn't let us leave. So then the leaders there, they were forced to put us on stage. And so we chanted on stage with big microphones and thousands of people came to listen, and then we taught them how to chant Nitāi-Gaurāṅga, and they all chanted. Nitāi, Nitāi, Gaurāṅga, Gaurāṅga.
