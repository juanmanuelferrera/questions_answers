<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> ...am very pleased to meet you. Good of you to see me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I've been in India just once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I was over in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Calcutta. Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Aaḥ, I was staying with Brother Andrew. I don't know whether you know him. He works with Mother Theresa in (?)pur over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Near Chowringhee? There is a place called Chowringhee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Ah, no, it wasn't there. It was right in Calcutta itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Right in Calcutta proper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes. Right in Calcutta. And he was an Australian Jesuit who founded an order of Brothers to work over there with Mother Theresa. So he used to work near there. And, er, how long are you staying out here in Australia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> You're finding it very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Would you like to drink water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No thank you. How many hours of prayer a day do, say, the men here do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To worship God, we have got nine processes. One is to hear about God and to speak about God-<span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.</span> Then, memorizing God's activities. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then worshiping his feet-just like we offer flower to the feet. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanam.</span> Then Deity worship, just like we are doing in the temple, Deity worship. Then <span class="Italic">vandanam,</span> offering prayers, just like you do in the church. <span class="Italic">Vandanam, dāsyam,</span> to engage oneself always in the service. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam. Sakhyam</span>-to taking as the best friend, considering God as the best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Consider God as?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Arjuna did. Arjuna worshiped God as friend, the best friend. God is the best friend for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's right. As John says, "God is love."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So, <span class="Italic">dāsyaṁ sakhyam ātma-nivedanam,</span> to offer everything to God-whatever I have got, my body, my money, my... everything. These are nine processes:</div>
<div class="Verse">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam<br class="calibre2"/>arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sakhyam ātma-nivedanam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.5.23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Nine processes. So these nine processes you take. Or you take eight or you take seven or you take six or you take five, you take four, you take three, you take two-at least one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And is everybody able to take the nine processes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And do you have a, what I may call a training in contemplation, in which you get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">smaraṇam.</span> Memorizing. Thinking of God's activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And, er, now in mysticism, Christian mysticism, Western mysticism, we have, say, the seven castles of St. Theresa of Avila, and we have a process of contemplation which we call infused, which God gives. Ordinary prayer, which anybody is able to make. Theresa would speak about the three castles, the first three castles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three castle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Mm. In her book, <span class="Italic">Interior Mansions.</span> But the real mystic prayer, well, is not given to everybody. Do you have... Do these men get trained in mystic prayer, contemplation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mystic prayer means to think of God's activities. So that is <span class="Italic">smaraṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> <span class="Italic">Smaraṇam.</span> Not so much thinking of them as just being really in His presence and open to receive love and to be active. Do you know what I mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, but <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is activity. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not passive. Active. Just like hearing. It is activity. Similarly glorifying, this is activity. <span class="Italic">Smaraṇam,</span> remembering, memorizing, that is activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That is true. I see that. I think I sort of see a higher form of activity, where the senses really have taken over...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense means activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Intuition. Something higher than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense, when you use your sense, just like <span class="Italic">śravaṇam,</span> hearing. So you use your sense. So this is activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I see that. I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You engage your ear. That means activity. I glorify, I speak, I engage my tongue in glorifying. That is activity. But as soon as there is sense activity, that is activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Hmm. But to get that real stillness and quiet in which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not stillness. That is neutrality. Stillness means you stop your material activity. That is stillness. But your material activities, when you stop it, that is stillness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> What is neutrality then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is neutrality, that neither spiritual nor material-on the marginal stage. It is called simply realizing how God is great. That is neutrality. But real devotion begins when one understands that "God is so great, I am rendering my service to this world uselessly. Why not render service to God?" That is called <span class="Italic">dāsyam,</span> beginning of active devotion. We are active in the material world. It is useless. Simply wasting time and making one entangled in repetition of birth and death. Material activities. This is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti-mārga. Pravṛtti-mārga</span> means sense enjoyment. And for sense enjoyment we have to accept so many different types of bodies, 8,400,000. Everyone is busy in sense enjoyment. The tiger is busy, the hog is busy, the dog is busy. The man also, if he becomes busy like tigers and hogs and dog, then he's going to become again the same species of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> When he reaches a higher state of activity, where he really loves all mankind, and he loves God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a kind of concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> A kind of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Concoction, mental speculation. Why should you love mankind? Why not tiger?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Because they are my brothers and sisters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, brother and sister everyone loves? In the family, everyone loves his brother and sister. Does it mean that he's a very big man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Because there is a common father, God is the father of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, common fellow, that is... (To devotee:) Who can read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Bring <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out this verse:</div>
<div class="Verse">vidyā-vinaya-sampanne<br class="calibre2"/>brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br class="calibre2"/>śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br class="calibre2"/>paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 5.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Vidyā, vidyā.</span> Call Paramahaṁsa. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> 5.18</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (inaudible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">vidyā-vinaya-sampanne<br class="calibre2"/>brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br class="calibre2"/>śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br class="calibre2"/>paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 5.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision the learned and gentle <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a cow, an elephant, a dog and a dog-eater (outcaste)."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Just read again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "The humble sage, by virtue of true knowledge, sees with equal vision...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Equal vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> What does that mean, equal vision?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal vision means that I don't make any distinction between you and a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> You make no distinction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is spiritual vision because a <span class="Italic">paṇḍita, paṇḍita</span> means learned man, his equal vision means he does not make any difference between the souls. The dog has got also soul and the learned scholar has got also soul. But the soul is covered by the dog's body, and here the soul is covered by the learned scholar's body. Actually both of them are souls, part and parcel of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Would you think that their souls are of different value, the soul of the dog...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, soul is of the same value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That I would find hard to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> 'Cause as I would understand it, the soul of the man, of any man, is what we would call a spiritual soul, an immortal soul, and the soul of the animal is a principle of life, what the Greeks would call <span class="Italic">savvy(?),</span> Aristotle would call <span class="Italic">psyche.</span> But it is not of an immortal soul, therefore the man has higher value than the animal, the dog, something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What do you think? Just like a child, as a child's father, the child has got different soul and the father has got different soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> They've got different souls but they're both immortal, spiritual souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is important, the child or the father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Both are important, both very important, both more important than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one? Which important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He says both are equally important, but they're both more important than the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Important, so far important is concerned, both of them same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Same, they're different people aren't they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you say both of them equal. That means from the importance point of view, they're the same. You say both of them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> The father and son, they're both the same importance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But they're different people, they're different souls...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you say both of them important, on which platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But when you say two things are important, you don't say they are they are of equal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, life. Both of them are life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Both of them are life, a flower has life, a dog has life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> A man has life, for me that is a gradation of life, you've got to start...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That gradation so far, just like there are gradation of motor cars. This is made by Ford, this is made by (indistinct), but the petrol is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> The petrol is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Hm, even that can vary, but still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no still, petrol is the same. The machine</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">may be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> They're all machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the body is machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> All inferior (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, body is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Body is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But a person is more than just matter. I'm more than matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the person, just like... that is... If a man is sitting on a Rolls Royce car, he's thinking, "Very important." And a man sitting on some ordinary car, he's thinking, "I am poor." But as man, both of them (are) equal. Falsely, because he is sitting in a particular type of car, he is thinking, "I am bigger."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, I can see I agree with all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the soul is the same. So there is no difference, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> find out this verse. Soul is the part and parcel of the supreme soul, Supersoul, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That is what I find hard to understand, your divine grace, that my soul, your soul is part of the supreme soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, their soul is part and parcel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I can't understand that because the supreme soul, God, the deity, is infinite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, infinite, just like your, I'll let you know, just like the ocean and the drop of ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But even the... No, no, I can't say that either, the ocean is not infinite, the ocean is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a comparison, a drop of water... He is infinite, God is infinite, we are finite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> We are finite, God is infinite, therefore we cannot, added together, make up God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I don't say that. I don't say that. That finite and infinite, they... Finite is there, only "in" is not there. That is lacking. They, individual soul, (indistinct) we are not infinite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But God is infinite, and I am finite. So the finite portion is common. The "in" is more in God, infinite. So similarly I am giving the example, just like a drop of ocean water, it contains the same chemical, you find salty, and the whole ocean also salty, but the ocean is big salt and this drop is a small particle. The salt is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But I can't accept the example because the little drops of water which have salt and so on, all together coalesce to form the huge ocean but the ocean is still finite. It is not infinite. But you and I are finite...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> If we coalesce together, then that how many of us that there are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm not comparing that combined together that we shall be equal to God. I don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I didn't follow you then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't (indistinct) some men here, or the whole universal souls combined together, still they are finite. They're not infinite. Yes, multi-billions of zeroes cannot make one. So I don't say that, but the quality is there very minutely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Imitation of the divine powers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not imitation, actually we have got. Just like, another example, gold and a particle of gold, a small fragmentary, that will be called gold, but not the gold equal to the mine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the philosophy is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> inconceivable one and different simultaneously. One in quality, but different in quantity. God's power... I have got some creative power, and God has got creative power. So the creative power is there. But God has created millions of the planets that floating in the air and we have created a 747 airplane, we want to take more credit than God. That is our foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, I say that is man's sin, if you like, is that he prides himself on his achievements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is false pride. The scientist, the modern scientists, they are taking false pride that there is no need of God, we are now creating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Some of them are, not all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of the fools, not all fools, but some of the fools declaring themselves as scientists, "There is no God." We can (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Let me see if I can understand what you mean by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God means all-powerful, the great. You say also, "The great."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I'd say all-powerful, omnipotent, the great, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> All-loving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything He's great. Nobody can surpass His love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I mean God is all-loving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When you say "Great," He's great in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Good. Do you... In Christianity we have the trinity, the Father, Son and the relationship of love between them which we call three persons in one God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> In your understanding of God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God, God and His love towards us... Because we are sons of God, therefore Father has natural love for sons, therefore God comes. God sends His son or representative to canvass that "You come to God, you'll be happy there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Who was the son He sent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Just like Jesus, we say "son of God." So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's the second person made man, become human, becomes a man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He is very important, but He is son, a very important son. Just like father may have many sons, but one of them may be very important, very good assistant to the father so Christ is like that. He is son of God, very important, He's helping God coming down to reclaim these fallen souls that "Come to God, why you are suffering here?" Son, He's very faithful and important son. But the others, they are also sons, but they have forgotten God. Therefore they are suffering. So sometimes He sends His son or His devotee and sometimes He comes Himself, that is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And He comes in bodily form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God has... Why, the son has got body then the father has got body. Your son has got body so you have got your body. Without the father having body, how the son can get body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I don't understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If... Suppose your son, you have got this body, so your father must have body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly if the son of God has body, the God must have body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Not necessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Can you show any example, a son is born from without body?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway that your experience is on the human field, you have to give some example that "Here is no body but the sun has body." Show me the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> You can have a man who has a thing in what we would call super-eminence and he has it on a higher form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Higher form maybe, but there is form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> You take a musician like Beethoven, a musician...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We also say that the God has got form but not form like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, he hasn't got form in Aristotle's idea of the word form either, his higher <span class="Italic">wathic(?)</span> theory of matter and form. In a sense, form there means spirit and so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> ...but we're not using it in that sense. When you're using the word form, you mean a material form like a shape, a body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't say material form, spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, I haven't understood you then. God, you say, has a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Aḥ well, matter of words, I can understand that. He has a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not this form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, not material. He's not matter, He's pure...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> We would say He's pure spirit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes, that is stated in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> There's no form of passivity in God, there's no form of change in God, there's no, no limitations of any sort. Matter has limitations. The soul is immortal because it has no principle of corruption in it. Aristotle would say that matter has parts, outside parts, and so it can, it has in itself the power of dissolving and it would break up, corrupts. The soul never does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got this material body and spiritual soul. That is in this material condition there is distinction between the spirit and matter. As soon as the spirit goes from this material body, it has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No life, true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is matter only, lump of matter, combination of matter. Therefore the spirit is important even in this life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, I see that, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, spirit is important. But God is fully spirit, He has no material quality. Yes. We have got, in this material condition, difference between the matter and spirit, but God has not so, such thing. He is whole spirit. That is the difference between God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And also, as a result, the human, you, I, all these, we're all persons separate from one another, distinct from one another, and distinct from God, who is a separate person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, we admit that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> It's that I haven't understood. Sometimes you get pantheists who talk as though God is made up of a sum total of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a theory, that is a theory, that is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, it's a false theory because it goes against all logic and philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But no, theory in this form that God is everywhere, by His potency but everything is not God. This is our philosophy. God is everywhere. Just like the sunshine. Sunshine is spread everywhere but that does not mean that everything is sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is like that. God is all-pervading by His potency. This book, this is also energy of God. Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Do you, in your creed, do you believe in metempsychosis, that is the soul going through one form of life and then if it lives badly, the person lives badly, it comes back in another form and so on? Do you believe in the metempsychosis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Transmigration of souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I find it hard to accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difficulty? Just like you have entered this black dress and I have entered this as colored dress, but as human being we are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But to think that my soul belongs, say to a dog in ages gone past, or that it's going to come back and be a tiger or another person that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tiger is the body and human form is also the body, so if you want to become like a tiger, then God helps you to enter the body of the tiger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I find it hard to accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you'll not accept God is so kind if you want to be something, He helps you, "All right you come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> It seems to me that God sent Jesus to tell the whole world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God says that, that "You don't desire anything, you simply become faithful to Me." That is God's desire. But we are not abiding by the orders of God. We want, we desire so many things. Just like, don't mind if I say, that God says, "Thou shalt not kill." But we are killing. We are violating. Their tendency is there so we must suffer for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Aḥ, true, sure. If we know that we're doing wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are not abiding by the order of God, therefore we must be prepared to suffer. So I, if I kill you then you kill me. Then going on, then I'll kill you, you kill me, go on. Life for life. You have no right to kill but if you kill then you'll be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I can accept all that. Although it's true that God has said, "Love one another."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> People have always obeyed God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'd kill. Instead of loving, they kill, so they must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But it's not proved that the way of suffering is to come back in another form which is the theory of transmigration of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you're in this apartment, you can go to another apartment and that apartment may not be exactly like this. It may be better or it may be worse. Similarly we have entered, find out the <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"As the embodied soul continually passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a child gets another body, boyhood. The boy gets another body, youth. The youth gets another body, old man. Similarly when this body is not useful then he gets another body. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> as we experience <span class="Italic">dehāntara,</span> different types of body, we are getting one after another, similarly the soul is immortal, he'll get another body. Now here it is not mentioned what kind of body, "another body." The "another body" means, there are 8,400,000 different types of body so he can enter any one of them according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> That will be selected by higher authorities. Just like I do not know here, in India, in New Delhi, the Indian government, they give, I mean to say, house, accommodation to the government servant. So there are different types of houses, for minister one type of house, for secretaries for one type of house, for the clerks one type of house. So according to the position, one type of house is offered. So our, we are acting here according to our resultant action of the activities we get next birth.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That is under the control of material nature. You find out, <span class="Italic">kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgaḥ asya. </span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the material nature has gone, three modes goodness, passion and ignorance, and mixture. So we are association with the modes of material nature and according to that nature we are manufacturing our next body. This is the... So in the material world we are infecting several types of quality of the nature. Not everyone is on the same quality. Just like these boys, they are being trained up under certain quality, they're not going to the restaurant, they are not going to the liquor shop, they're not smoking, they're not eating meat, they are no illicit sex, they are being trained up, this is a quality. And another man is going to the liquor shop, to the brothel, so many other things. They're not of the same quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> What is it all leading to? A state of liberation from material things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are two... Now in the human form of life, we have got two selection, I think in the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> also it is said that one goes to hell, one goes to heaven. So we have got two selection, either to the path of hellish condition or to the path of back to home, back to Godhead. This is human life. It is in Sanskrit word it is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti-mārga, nivṛtti-mārga. Nivṛtti-mārga</span> means stopping the material way of life and go to the spiritual world, back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Does that name, that the things such as, you mentioned smoking and alcohol and sex and meat, that all those things are material and therefore bad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Take sex, how can that be considered...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or Christian religion also there is celibacy, life, you also trained up, the nuns, the priests, they are not meant for marrying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's true. We don't say that sex is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are forbidden to marry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, it's a question of something I freely accept, freely accept not to marry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, this is spiritual life. Sex life is not spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That I find so hard to accept because everything that God makes is good. When God makes a man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good, what is good for you is not good for me, one man's food is another man's poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But everything that God makes is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, good for somebody. Just like stool, stool is good for the pigs not for the human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But everything that God makes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not everything is good. The pigs considers stool is very good, nice food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Every man is made with sex appetites. Every man is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti, pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalā.</span> This is natural inclination, but if you can stop it, that is victory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, I can't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now why you do not accept? In the Christian religion there is unmarried life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Married life is a good life. The use of sex is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Eating is good. If it's abused it's bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Married life is good, that if you follow the rules and regulations. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Therefore sex, in itself, is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sex is good, that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span> Find out, <span class="Italic">balaṁ balavatām asmi dharma...,</span> like that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> What is this book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He is speaking, the God is speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddha,</span> sex life which is not against religious principle, that I am. Kṛṣṇa, God says. So sex life is not bad provided it is under the religious system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's true of everything, yes. I thought you were saying sex in itself is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Sex life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> There have been people in the history of the world like the Manicheans and that who held that sex in itself was bad. Now I couldn't accept that. It's part of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddha.</span> Just you can have sex for begetting nice children but not for sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Also for increasing the love between husband and wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Even though they can't have children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can have children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Suppose they can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can, if they can beget nice children, they can have sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But suppose they can't have children. Would you say they can still have sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That is where I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is illicit sex. If you cannot produce children, and still you have sex, that is illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, well I find it hard to accept that. Tell me more about your concept of God. I'd be very interested to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is great. He's great in every respect, in strength...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Is He a person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless... A person... What is the meaning of great?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well you can speak about a mountain being great and that's not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But God can swallow millions of mountains. That is God. Your conception is: mountain is very great. But our conception is: God is so great that He can swallow millions of mountains. So whose greatness is greater, the mountain's or God's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well it's a different order altogether, one's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "God is great," means whatever greatness, just as sky is the great, there are millions of sky, that is God's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's all in the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material and spiritual, we both speak. "God is great," means He's materially great and spiritually great. That is His greatness. If you think that He's spiritually great and materially small, that is not great. That is not greatness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> You know, in the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> it says God knows everybody yet and knows them by name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is greatness. That is His greatness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> A knowing person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know yourself or you know myself, but you cannot know everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But God knows everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And loves everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Would you say that He loves the person that is doing wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He comes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> To save.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Don't do wrong." That is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And if the person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore that is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And if the person rejects that love, does He still love him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, still love him. He's trying. God is situated in everyone's heart, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> God cannot change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is friend always. He is sitting with the individual soul within the heart and giving him good advice that "You come to Me, you'll be happy." But he's not going. Therefore he's (indistinct). Still God is with him, "All right, let me see." Just like the father, he loves his son. He always gives him, "My dear son, why you are going out? Your father has got nice property, you live with me." But he'll not do, he'll go away and become hippie. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> "Kṛṣṇa," what exactly does "Kṛṣṇa" mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. That is great. You say, "God is great." We say God, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. Unless you are the great, you cannot be all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> When you speak of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God consciousness, God consciousness. God is great and I am His eternal servant. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Two words: God is great and I am His eternal servant, I am small. This consciousness is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Do you know the prayer that the Russians use, the Jesus prayer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any prayer. God is one. Either you pray in a different way, I'll pray in a different way, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I know that but I want to know do you know what is known as the Jesus prayer which the Russians use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, he doesn't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> It seems to me that you chant, don't you, Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That is a prayer, it's a rhythmic chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is prayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now that is a form of prayer and the Jesus prayer, would you do the same? You would either chant it...? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Aḥ, well, maybe from the point of your giving glory to God, no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, that is spiritual, that is spiritual. To give glory to God, that is spiritual. And otherwise, what do you think of this materiality of this chanting? Chanting is not material. Chanting is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, it depends. I mean, some thing, of course...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Spiritual thing does not depend on anything material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> The sum product that the full prayer is certainly a spiritual experience created by a material use of lips and things like that, it makes a noise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not material creation. Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is not material creation. It is from the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, I see that, but I mean if you've spoken words... All I'm trying to say is that it's body and soul together praying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Body and soul different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, of course, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body and soul different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But that's the point I was trying to make, that you have a gradation in your prayer of..., in the Jesus prayer, in which you speak and you can hear the noise, chanting. You might say something like this: (Sings softly) Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Now, that's a chanting, a singing, and it sums up everything I believe in, say, in the word Jesus. But then there can be the other where there's no sound is heard, but I'm still thinking it in my mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly you can think of Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Sings) Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... Same thing. Where is the difference? There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> The third form is where I do not think it, it's just, I'm sort of rapt, absorbed in the divine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that attention, ecstasy, comes in Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Otherwise these young boys are chanting and dancing... Unless there is ecstasy... They are not monkeys. They are human beings. They are dancing, with education, with culture. Unless there is spiritual ecstasy, how they can chant and dance for hours together? It is not monkey dancing. It is spiritual. It is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, I can see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is God's omnipotency. When you offer sincere prayer, the words become spiritual. That is wanted. If you sincerely offer your prayers, God understands. Even though sound appears to be material it is no more material; it is spiritual. Just like... I will give you one example. Just you put one iron rod in the fire. So the iron rod becomes warm, warmer, warmer, and then it becomes red hot. When it is red hot, it is no more iron. It is fire. You touch that red hot anywhere; it will burn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Hm. Transformed, it changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So actually there is nothing material. When God consciousness is there, it is spiritual. This... In association with God, everything becomes spiritual. Just like there is a church and there is an ordinary house. People say, " This is church, God's place, and this is house." What is the difference? That is also made of bricks; that is also made of bricks. Why people go to the church? Why not to the house? So the conclusion is, when the atmosphere is surcharged with God consciousness, it is spiritual. Immediately. Otherwise, as soon as you forget God, then it is material. Material and spiritual means where there is no forgetfulness of God, that is spiritual. And where there is forgetfulness of God, that is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Hm. Sort of a figurative use of the word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not figurative, it is actual. Actually, God is all-pervading. Everything is God's energy. Therefore God is whole spirit. His energy cannot be material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, I can see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The material is, as soon as we forget the relationship with God. That is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise God is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But we're using the words in a figurative sense there. I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is actually. Just like the sunshine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> This is matter (knocks on something). This is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is matter so long we forget God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But no matter what you do to this, it will still remain matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is energy of God. Matter is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But it is still matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...inferior energy of God. Matter is not different from God. Find out, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because everything is emanates from God. He is the father of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> God has created everything, yes. But not everything is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I already said, that God is..., everything is depending on God, but not everything is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, true. So this, no matter what you do to it, it must remain matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is matter, but when it is used for God, this is spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, that's why I say it is figurative use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same example, just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> It still remains wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the church is made of matter, wood and stone, but it is spirit, because here there is nothing other business than God. So the real thing is, matter means forgetfulness of God. Read that, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Madhudviṣa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra itīyaṁ me<br class="calibre2"/>bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span>Bg. 7.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and false ego-altogether these eight comprise My separated material energies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So God being all spirit, His energy is also spirit. His energy cannot be different. But in this material energy we forget God. Therefore it is called material. If we know that this wood is also energy of God, that is spiritual understanding. And if we think that wood has come independently from any other source, that is material. In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> this is discussed in the beginning <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> to inquire about the Absolute Truth. The answer is <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "The Absolute Truth is that, or is the source of everything, Absolute Truth." So there are two things, material and spiritual. So both are coming from God. Just like darkness and light, two sides of the sun. So when there is light, we call day; when it is darkness, we call night. But they are simply two sides of the sun, the supreme light, or the material light. Similarly, material is darkness, and spiritual is light. Both sides. Sometime it is said "The spiritual is the front side of God, and material is the back side of God."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So your back side or front side, they are the same. So similarly... Therefore this pantheism, they say, "Why should we take? This is back side? Everything is God." That is their philosophy. They say that everything is God, pantheism. But that is not perfect knowledge. Everything is God, and again, everything is not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Everything is distinct from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> We are distinct persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">bhinnā prakṛtir aṣṭadhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> We share our being from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhinnā prakṛtiḥ,</span> that is stated, "separated energy." Material things means separated energy. Just like this tape recorder. When we are not here, they will play the record and I am speaking. That is separated energy. And I am directly speaking, that is nonseparated energy. So separated energy and nonseparated energy, they are coming from the same source. The source is the same. Therefore, ultimate issue, the source being all spirit, everything is spirit. But the place where we do not directly perceive God, that is material. And the place where we directly perceive God, that is spiritual. So either separated or connected, God is the only one source of all energies. That is explained there. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I couldn't find the other verses. The next verse is <span class="Italic">apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">apareyam itas tv anyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām<br class="calibre2"/>jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho<br class="calibre2"/>yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.5]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Besides..." Just, that previous verse was saying that "Earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence...all these comprise My separated material energies." In the next verse it says, "Besides this inferior nature, O mighty Arjuna, there is a superior energy of Mine, which are all living entities, who are struggling with the material nature and are sustaining the universe." The living entities are sustaining the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So from here we understand the material energy and the spiritual energy. So spiritual energy is predominating over the material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, I understand that. It's the spirit of God</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is superior energy, and the material energy, inferior energy. Just like in your body there are some inferior parts and some superior parts. But they are body, parts of the body. This part is superior part, and the rectum is inferior part. But that does not mean it does not form the constitution parts of your body. Otherwise how you become whole? Whole means comprising everything, superior, inferior. But comparatively, there is superior part, inferior part. So the material energy is also God's energy. And spiritual energy is also God's energy, but the spiritual energy is described here as superior energy, and the material energy is described here as inferior energy. But altogether, they are energies. So those who are expert devotees of God, they can utilize inferior energy for the purpose of superior energy. That is the proper utilization. Just like the same brick and stone is required for constructing an ordinary house, and the same brick and stone can be used for constructing a church.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That is superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Yes, I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The material is not different. The ordinary house is constructed with the same bricks and stone, and church is also made of that. But why it is superior? Because it is specially, only meant for God's purpose. So anything utilized for God's purpose, it becomes spiritual. This is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Very good. You're kind, talking to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are trying to engage everything in God's service, to make it superior energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> How do you see helping your fellow man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are helping. We are making them God conscious. Yes. That is best help. Instead of making them drunkard, woman-hunter, meat-eaters, we are making them Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the best help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And do they go out and make other disciples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He said do we go out and make other disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't accept as disciple anyone who does not follow the rules and regulations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Is it by prayer to God that you help the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is prayer, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa means "O Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa's energy, please accept me as Your servant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> But are you praying for all these people outside who do not belong to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> So you're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa so that they can hear and take benefit. But they see that, "They are disturbing," but we are helping them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And do you believe that God is pleased by your prayer and helps them because of your prayer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on God. God is fully independent. He may not like. You cannot force Him. But it is our duty to request Him. You cannot force Him. If He likes... If He does not like, that is His will, because He is the supreme will. But God likes. If a devotee requests Him something, He likes to accept. That is God's mercy. He takes the devotee's prayer very seriously. Therefore our another process is to take the shelter of a devotee first. Because even one is inferior, not to be accept by God, but if a devotee requests, "God, kindly accept this fellow," God accepts. Mercy of saintly... <span class="Italic">Kṛpā-siddha.</span> The Sanskrit word is <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddha.</span> He becomes perfect by the mercy of devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> What was the meaning of the bag you wear on your hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These chanting. Beads.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Oh, beads in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think in Christian there are beads also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I saw them in the picture, they had'em, and I didn't know what it was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is covering of the beads because we put here, there may be some dust. So to show respect to the beads, we keep it covered. We do not touch on the floor. It is awe and veneration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, I have kept you long enough. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can keep me engaged whole day and night, (laughter) provided you have got time. We are meant for this purpose. If anyone can understand God consciousness, that is a great profit for us. Now our appeal is to everyone, every religious sect, that people are becoming godless generally at the present moment. So we should make combined effort to revive their God consciousness. Otherwise it is doomed. And there is no question of Christian God or Hindu God or Muslim God. God is one. So there should be no difference between the system. According to the time and circumstances, there may be little difference, but really if we can understand God, either through Christianity or through Hinduism or Muslim, that is our profit. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> "That is first-class religion, following which, one becomes a lover of God". You become a lover of God. That we want to see. It doesn't matter whether you go through Christian religion or Mohammedan religion or Hindu religion or Buddhist...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> It doesn't matter. You understand God and love Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> I agree entirely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And it's good that, I think, we are coming more to understand that. And I think you see a lot of young people who really are longing for some form of contemplation and prayer. That is why you get followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, these boys they are coming from your Christian group, Jewish group, but they are taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. One priest in Boston, he issued one pamphlet that "These boys are our boys, and before this movement, they didn't care to come to the church. And now they are mad after God. How is it? The same boys." So indirectly he accepted this process as easier to understand God. And actually it is easier. What do they do? They don't go to the forest, or meditate, or make any very austere, what is called, penances. They simply chant in the morning and dance in ecstasy and then eat sumptuously. That's all. And now they have given up everything. Now, you bribe them, "You eat meat." They will never eat. They will not drink tea even. The method is... The American government they spent lots of money for stopping this addiction to drugs. And these boys, as soon as they come to me, they give up. Ask them what money I have bribed them. You can ask how they have left it.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">How they have left it? How they have given meat-eating, how they have given drinking even tea, cigarette, everything? What I have given them? I am poor Indian. I have no money. (laughter) But how they have accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> It satisfies the longing in the heart one has for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now you can ask them. They will inform, that nobody of them, either Hindu or Christian, Indian... They are coming all from Christian group or Jewish group. So they are all educated boys. So there is no question of bluffing them. Young boys, they can earn money like anything, especially in America. But they have given everything. They are very respectable father's son. But they have given up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> The thing is like Augustine said, that "The heart is restless until it rests in You, our God." And I think that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't teach them that I am God. I never taught. I always teach them I am servant of God, you are also servant. And they accept it. Actually that is our position. This is bluff. When somebody says "I am God," that is bluff, cheating. We protest very vehemently against the declaration that "I am God." No. Nobody can become God. God is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Well, I must run away. It's been very good talking to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Just take some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> This is a little fruit that we traditionally offer to a guest. We offer them a little fruit so could you take one piece?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take the whole plate. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Take the whole plate? I just eat it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> (laughing) Yes, yes. It's just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No special ceremony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We've already done that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Ok. When I was in India and I visited a shrine... It was the festival of the goddess of learning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Sarasvatī-pūjā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And they brought me fruit to eat at the end, and I was embarrassed, and I didn't know whether to take it or not, and they said it's their custom, "You must take it." So I did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We say by worshiping God, everyone is worshiped. There is no need of separately worshiping goddess of fortune, goddess of learning. Just like if you pour water on the root of the tree, it goes to every branch, leaf, and twigs, every..., approaches. Take some fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, no more, thank you. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Would you like a little water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> No, I am all right thanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So people, either through Christianity or through any process, they must come to the understanding platform where we can understand what is God and how to love Him. That is required. Otherwise this human civilization will be spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> And the great truth also that God loves every one of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God loves. That is natural, but you do not love, I do not love. That is the difficulty. Father loves the son; that is natural. But when the son does not love father that is a very precarious condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Good. Well, thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> Thank you. We will pray for one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit:</span> God bless you. Goodbye everybody. (leaves.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got that canteloupe? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No. Guruprasāda, you can get melon, honeydew melon now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guruprasāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Okay. You made him run away. He said, "I must run away." (laughing) (end).</div>
