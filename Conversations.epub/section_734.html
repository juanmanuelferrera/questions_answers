<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...this society. Only the important men, they can live as <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> Not that "Now I am in love with this girl and get me married and <span class="Italic">yajña</span> and then sleep." These things should be stopped. That, that what is his name, the rascal's name, that, whom you have driven away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Srnghadi(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Srnghadi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīnati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīnati.(?) From his face it appears that he's woman hunter. Did he talk with you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in every center they must rise early in the morning. They must follow the regulative principles. They must attend class. Otherwise let them go out. We don't want. And if anyone wants to marry, first of all he must show that he has some earning capacity. Not that "Because there are so many girls, and I marry one to satisfy my senses..." I thought that boy was nice, and I heard all these stories. That is also another defect, that we have got young boys and young girls open for lovemaking. And <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> means strictly prohibited to see the face of woman. But we cannot stop it. That is also another defect. Fire is good and butter is good, but when they come together everything become bad. Is it not? Fire is good, just like heat. And butter is good, healthy. But when they come together the butter melts and the fire extinguished. This is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> arrangement. <span class="Italic">Puṁsa striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam.</span> This whole world is going on by the sex attraction, and when they come together both of them become spoiled. Therefore it has to be dealt with very, very carefully, so many rules, regulation. [break] ...used, Nitāi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Whenever there is necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Compulsory. When there's rule, <span class="Italic">vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">vrajet,</span> "must." <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> At least let us inform the whole world that the process of civilization, education, everything rotten. That we have to say. (end)</div>
