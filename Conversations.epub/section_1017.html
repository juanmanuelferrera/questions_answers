<div class="Heading">Conversation with Seven Ministers<br class="calibre2"/>of Andhra Pradesh<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>August 22, 1976, Hyderabad</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(Ministers for Endowments, Social Services, Revenue, Public Works Dept., Minor Irrigation, Rehabilitation and Fisheries.)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">(long speech in Hindi by minister)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our subject matter of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that systematize... The progress of human society should be systematized according to <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Just like your government, it is conducted under certain rules and regulations. You have to refer to the government regulative principles, and expert government officers, they are selected. Formally it was ICS, now it is IAS. That means reference to the authorities. Similarly, there are authorities which are called <span class="Italic">śāstra. Śās-dhātu</span> means to rule. From <span class="Italic">Śās-dhātu, śāstra</span> and <span class="Italic">śastra. Śastra</span> means weapon. If you do not act according to the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> then there is <span class="Italic">śastra.</span> <span class="Italic">Śastra</span> means weapon, government. If you violate the rules of the government then there is police department, there is military department which will force you to accept the government regulation. And from the same <span class="Italic">śās-dhātu</span> is <span class="Italic">śiṣya,</span> one who voluntarily accepts the discipline.</div>
<div class="Verse">yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya<br class="calibre2"/>vartate kāma-kārataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>na sa siddhim avāpnoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The aim of human life is <span class="Italic">parāṁ gatim. Parāṁ gatim</span> means the supreme perfection. <span class="Italic">Gatim</span> means progress, and <span class="Italic">parām</span> means the supreme. Our life is progressive. By evolution we have come to this human form of life through many forms of life.</div>
<div class="Verse">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati<br class="calibre2"/>kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>pakṣīṇāṁ daśa-lakṣaṇam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Like that. In the beginning there was water, so the living entities were aquatics. Then, as the land came out, <span class="Italic">sthāvara,</span> then plants, creepers, trees. So we have to pass through nine <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> species of life in the water. Then trees, plants, two millions, twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> In this way there are 8,400,000 species of life, and when you come to the human form of life, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> we get this form of life. Now we have to select <span class="Italic">parāṁ gatim</span> or <span class="Italic">adho gatim.</span> We are given the chance of human form of life for further advancement. And that is also stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: </span></div>
<div class="Verse">yānti deva-vratā devān<br class="calibre2"/>pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhūtejyā yānti bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.25]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So if you worship the demigods, Indra, Candra, Varuṇa-<span class="Italic">yānti deva-vratā devān</span>-then you can go to the higher planetary system. They are trying to go to the moon planet. In that way it is not possible. You have to be qualified to go there. Not by machine, by force you can go there. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Yānti deva-vratā devān.</span> So... And also you can go, <span class="Italic">mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.</span> You can go to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So we have to make choice in this human form of life. Actually, the aim should be to go back home, back to Godhead. <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6]. Ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino 'rjuna [Bg. </span>8.16]<span class="Italic">.</span> Otherwise, within this material world, even if you go to the higher planetary system, then <span class="Italic">punar āvartinaḥ,</span> you have to come back again. Now the human form of life should be properly utilized. If we think that this life is everything, that is wrong conception of life. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> You have to change this body. Transmigration of the soul. So by transmigration of the soul we have got this human form of life. If we properly utilize it, then we can make further progress. And if we do not, if we keep ourself as animals, then we'll degrade. <span class="Italic">Adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So nature's law is there, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are not independent. We are dependent under the laws of material nature. So we should properly utilize this human form of life, and government or king means to guide the citizens how to make progress of life. That is the duty of the government. They should be given all chances to make progress. Formerly, all the kings were responsible for the progress of the citizens, progress of life. The same principle should be followed. That is the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> To maintain the body, just like we require the head, the arms, the belly, and the legs, similarly, we must maintain the brain of the society, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa;</span> and the arms of the society, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span>; and the belly of the society, the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span>; and the legs of the society, the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Everything is required. Not that simply brain is required and leg is not required. No, everything is required under proper guidance for the total benefit of the society. So direction is there. That is <span class="Italic">śāstra. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya...</span> If we do not care for the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> whimsically manufacture our own ways of life, <span class="Italic">na siddhiṁ sa avāpnoti,</span> it will never be successful. <span class="Italic">Na sukham.</span> And there will be no happiness. <span class="Italic">Na parāṁ gatim.</span> Therefore the whole process is <span class="Italic">yajñārthāt karmaṇa. Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]. Yajña</span> means the Supreme Lord, Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Yajña</span> means <span class="Italic">yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ.</span> After performing <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> if we enjoy life, then there is no sinful reaction. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt</span> [Bg. 3.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So all directions are there in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> and the essence of all Vedic literature is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So at the present moment, our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that it doesn't matter what kind of state it is, but it should follow the principle of <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñārthe karmaṇa.</span> Otherwise, we shall be responsible. Just like, for example, a military man, what is his business? His business is killing. So by the government order he is killing, and the more number of enemies he kills, he gets medal, reward. But the same man, if he kills one man, he'll be hanged-for his own sense gratification. He cannot argue that "In the military camp I have killed so many men and I was rewarded, and now I have killed one man and I am going to be hanged. Why?" The question may be raised. No foolish man will raise the question. That means that killing is under the superior order, and this killing is for your sense gratification. So if you do anything for our sense gratification then it will be <span class="Italic">stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12].</span> He is punishable. But if we execute the supreme order, then you are rewarded. The same action. We are requesting therefore everywhere, not only in India, all over the world, that act according to the order of the supreme, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. And gradually they are accepting the principle. So why not in India? In India, the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken in India. Still, in India there are many devotees, many Kṛṣṇa conscious persons. Especially in this province. You are very great devotees of Bālajī. Bālajī is Kṛṣṇa, Bāla Kṛṣṇa. So I wish that the government may be conducted under the guide of Bālajī, Lord Kṛṣṇa. That is my request. And the codes and the orders and the rules and regulations, they're all stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So if we follow the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and accept... We accept, consciously or unconsciously. That is our Indian culture, Vedic culture. Still, hundreds and thousands of people go to see Bālajī, and they contribute their hard-earned money for worshiping the Lord. This is the principle. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> I have seen in Bālajī temple, mostly cultivators, they come, stand whole day there just to offer something, <span class="Italic">yajñārthe,</span> for the satisfaction of the Lord. It's a great culture. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra.</span> So <span class="Italic">karma,</span> ordinary fruitive activities should be carried on for <span class="Italic">yajñārthe,</span> for the satisfaction of Bālajī, or Kṛṣṇa. Not otherwise. The same, what is gathered as contribution, it should be utilized for <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Because the money is given for <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> not for other purposes. That is a fact. Of course, the money is there. The innocent villagers, they have given the money in good faith that Kṛṣṇa or Bālajī will accept it and their hard labor will be successful. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe karmaṇa.</span> Now that money should be properly utilized for <span class="Italic">yajñārthe.</span> Actually, everything belongs to God, Bālajī. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> We are claiming unnecessarily, "This is mine." That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Nothing belongs to us. Everything belongs to the Supreme Lord. But we have claimed the Lord's property as our own. That is misgiving. Therefore <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is recommended. Return to the Supreme voluntarily. That is called <span class="Italic">yajña. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">varṇāśramācāra-vatā<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān<br class="calibre2"/>viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā<br class="calibre2"/>nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> this is plan just to teach the whole society how to perform <span class="Italic">yajña. Varṇāśramācāra-vatā.</span> Therefore this is the beginning of human civilization. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama.</span> How to return back. Just like Bali Mahārāja. Bali Mahārāja achieved, obtained, throughout the universe all the property, and he again returned to Vāmana. That was his success of life. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is an educational movement to teach people how one should voluntarily return the property of the Lord to the Lord. That is called <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> So people actually suffering. Not only... This material life means suffering. We may say that we are very happy, but that is not the fact. <span class="Italic">Tri-tāpa,</span> three kinds of miserable condition of life are there always, <span class="Italic">adhyātmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika.</span> But we are accustomed to suffering, and we say suffering is happiness. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Actually, material life is... This body, as soon as we get this body, it means suffering.</div>
<div class="Verse">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma<br class="calibre2"/>yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam<br class="calibre2"/>asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kleśa. Material body means <span class="Italic">kleśa,</span> suffering. Why you are using this fan? Because without fan the body will be in pain, painful condition. So we are adjusting, trying to counteract. But the position is miserable. Therefore whole plan of Vedic civilization-how to avoid this material body. That is called <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span> That is the plan. So Ṛṣabhadeva is advising that <span class="Italic">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> People have become mad, and they're doing everything which is not sanctioned by the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Pramatta. Pramatta</span> means mad. And why they have become mad? <span class="Italic">Indriya-prītaye,</span> for sense gratification. There is no big hope. It is simply sense gratification. Sense gratification is there even in the animal life. So human life is not meant for sense gratification. That is also said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke<br class="calibre2"/>kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye<br class="calibre2"/>tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> So the human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> not for sense gratification. Sense gratification, the facility is there even in the hogs and dogs life. So the human life is meant for <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> We have got this chance. And especially in your province there is Bālajī, and Bālajī has got sufficient income. That income should be utilized for satisfaction of Bālajī. Not otherwise. That is our request. People are suffering for want of God consciousness. So everything should be spent for spreading God consciousness all over the world. At least, people are contributing to Bālajī, so whatever Bālajī's property is there, that should be utilized for Bālajī's mission. The Bālajī's mission is... That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: </span></div>
<div class="Verse">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg 18.68]</div>
<div class="Verse">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.69]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This <span class="Italic">idaṁ guhyam,</span> this confidential knowledge of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> should be spread all over the world. People are suffering. And that is the mission of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He advises that <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa, yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it will be glory of India if we preach the message of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They're accepting. And I wish that the Bālajī's estate, Bālajī's money, should be spent for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, not for any other purpose. That is my request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Please permit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your question is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> I wanted to, Swamiji...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśramācāra-vatā.</span> The <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> I've already explained. Just like for maintenance of the whole body there are different parts: the brain, the arm, the belly, and the leg. Similarly, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> means the head-<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>; the arms-<span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>; the belly-<span class="Italic">vaiśya</span>; and the leg-<span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So by nature these divisions are there. <span class="Italic">Varṇa,</span> four <span class="Italic">varṇas</span> and four <span class="Italic">āśramas.</span> Four <span class="Italic">varṇas</span> means social divisions, and four <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> spiritual division. So apart from spiritual division, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> the social division must be observed. The brain must be there. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa.</span> Everything must be there. Not only the brain. The arms also required-military department or <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> department. <span class="Italic">Yuddhe cāpy apalayanam(?).</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> are so brave, they don't go away from fighting field, battlefield. Just like Arjuna was trying to become nonviolent. Immediately Kṛṣṇa chastised him, <span class="Italic">kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame samupasthitam anārya-juṣṭam akīrti-karam.</span> So everything is required. It is not that everyone should become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Neither it is possible that everyone should be able to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> It is not so easy thing. But a class of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> must be maintained. A class of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> must be there as ideal to consult with them. Similarly, a class of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> must be there, a class of <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> must be there. This is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> For the peaceful execution of material life these things are required, division. Just like in your government you have got some different ministerial department. You have introduced, this minister is for this department, this minister... Similarly, the brain department must be there. Without brain, even... Suppose a madman, he has got his hands and legs, but it is useless because the brain is lost. So brain must be there. So this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> revival of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> is required. A class of men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa-sattva śamo damas titikṣā ārjavaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> As there are different educational system, there must be an educational institute where these things are taught: how to become truthful, how to become self-controlled, how to become full in knowledge, how to become full believer in the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Āstikyam.</span> In this way, as there is necessity of engineer, as there is necessity of medical man, as there is necessity of so many other departmental chiefs, similarly, a department of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a department of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>-that education must be given. But in this age, because nobody is interested, so everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ. Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone, all over the world, they are being educated to seek after some good service. <span class="Italic">Paricarya:</span> he must have a good master; then his education will be... He cannot act independently. So therefore in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said that everyone is anxious to get a good job, therefore, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ,</span> in this age almost everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So if <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are there only, if there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> no <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> that society will not prosper very much. If we accept the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra, yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> or <span class="Italic">kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> it is not by birth. It is by qualification. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. Guṇa.</span> One must acquire the quality of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and he must act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then he is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> Even in <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> family, if one is born <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> but he has attained the quality of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must be accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> injunction.</div>
<div class="Verse">yasya yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>puṁso varṇābhivyañjakam<br class="calibre2"/>yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta<br class="calibre2"/>tat tenaiva vinirdiśet<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.11.35]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Yad anyatra.</span> If the quality of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is found in a person who is born in a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> family, he should be accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Similarly, if the quality of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is found in <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> quality found in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> I mean to say birth, by caste, as it is going on now, so Nārada Muni has said... This is the statement of Nārada Muni, the greatest authority. <span class="Italic">Yad anyatrāpi dṛśyeta tat tenaiva vinirdiśet</span> [SB 7.11.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> So birth is not the final thing. If one is born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family or <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> family, he has got the facility to become quickly a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>; but if he has no quality, if he does not practice, then he is not to be accepted as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> You may be a son of a high-court judge, but unless you have got the quality of high-court judge, it is not that because you are born of high-court judge you become a high-court judge. That is not, that is not the quality. The quality is... So therefore I say that there must be educational institution for training <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya</span> especially. And <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they do not require any academical area. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣi-gorakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam</span> [Bg 18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> They can learn simply by associating with another <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> But <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> especially require education, Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Paṭhana-pāṭhana-yajana-yājana-dāna-pratigrahaḥ. Kṣatriya</span> also requires education. Others, they may not require education. Practical training. These things should be introduced. Then human society will be perfect. Not by birth, but by quality, by education, by training. But that is possible. So your answer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> No, the institution for training this Swamiji? Your proposition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. I have got so many ideas.</div>
