<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car) <span class="Italic">...saṁsāre māyāra janeiya, moha janeiya, jīva ke karaye gadha.</span> This <span class="Italic">māyāra vaibhava,</span> this material advancement is advancement of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Big, big building, nice road, nice motor car, nice... Surely it is material advancement, admitted. But this advancement is advancement of the illusory energy. So what is the wrong there? Suppose... The wrong is there that this material world is temporary. We have come here temporarily, say twenty-five years, fifty years or at most, hundred years. So we are already illusioned and we become more illusioned. Then we forget our real business. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha,</span> we remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Supposing if there is next birth, so who is very much anxious to know what is our next birth? Nobody is. Blindly going on. <span class="Italic">māyāra vaibhava.</span> [break] ...very nice church, but understand what for this church is, what is God, what is God consciousness. Just cultivate this knowledge. "No, big church finished." Live nice building, nice happy life, but don't forget Kṛṣṇa. Then what is the use of this life? And if you forget Kṛṣṇa, then the result will be crime, and you will be facing with problems, "Why and now what to do?" So many problems will be there. So the problems cannot be solved simply by possessing big, big buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Shall we get out and walk, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>

In India you do not see so many temples. I was surprised when I went there first. Because you do not see very many big, gorgeous, temples. But here everywhere there are big gorgeous churches.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Therefore too much attachment for material enjoyment is disqualification for spiritual life. So the western world is trained up for being too much attached to material enjoyment. Therefore lagging behind in spiritual life. Vedic civilization is not to encourage too much for material enjoyment. Minimize. That is Indian civilization. They, if they had money they used to spend for constructing big temple, not for residential house. Maybe the king only had a big palace. Common men, they didn't care for big palace, the palatial building. Common man would be very glad to live in a cottage, and a small garden for growing vegetables, fruits, small lake, that's all. Not wasting time for big, big buildings, big, big... What is called, amenities?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In Detroit-that's the biggest crime city in America-one out of every thousand people gets murdered every year. If you live there for fifty years, you have one chance in twenty of being murdered. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why? Because it's such a huge place and it's not in a very exclusive neighborhood. It's surrounded by a six foot high stone wall. It's on four acres of land. And in the room that...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It was the Fisher Mansion. Fisher, you know, "Body by Fisher." And the man was a little eccentric. It's a Moorish style.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Is it a crime place?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...Mahāprabhu also had difficulty with the caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas?</span></div>

[break] ...report of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> the police came and broke these drums. It was not the fault of the Mohammedans. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> lodged complaint against Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he has to take step. They said, "It is not Hindu religion. They are disturbing God by chanting so loudly. (laughter) Now the God is sleeping and they are disturbing, 'Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa.' So stop this." So what can he do? After all, he is public servant. Therefore he took steps. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma (Bhakti-tīrtha):</span> I've just come back from England, myself and another boy who was doing library work there. We went there after India, the festival. And so many very important schools all around the world, that are known all around the world are taking your books. Our last day was one of our most amazing days. We went to the Indian office library, the British government. Because they have colonized India, they have so many books on India. This was the largest library like that in Europe. And the librarian, he looked at our books and he says, "Yes, we should have all of these." So right on the spot he ordered standing orders, one copy of every book. That same day-this was just three days ago, two days ago-we went to the big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Aldridge, Aldridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Yes. This was another one. Aldridge, yes. You have seen that letter? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have not seen any letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> But you know Aldridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I went to see the ambassador.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Yes, he is very favorable. The biggest book store in the world. They're so big, they have three blocks. They take up sort of like three blocks. And they have three levels, three floors. So we went to see the manager, the man who owns the whole book store. And he says, "Well, I only deal with rare books." We says, "Well, this is why we've come to see you." And he says, "I want three copies of every book."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. So they have ordered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Just in a matter of four, about seven to eight weeks over a hundred professors have taken your books there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Standing order?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> No, about ten have taken standing orders, but others have taken books to use for their courses or for their own reading and for their own edification. Big schools like Cambridge, Oxford, as soon as they see the books, they really want them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the rarest book. Not only rare, but rarest. There is no book throughout the whole world, such book. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> ...professor, he was reading your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it was on his desk when I came into his office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Yeah. He says, "Oh, yes, I know the Bhaktivedanta books. I have just got this book from one of my colleagues." And he says, I showed him the books. He wanted the standing order. He teaches Sanskrit and Indian religions and Indian philosophy. And he said, "Well, there's one book I was just reading. Bhaktivedanta, he mentions the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion." </span>He says that "You didn't show me that. Do you have that one?" (Prabhupāda laughs) So I brought the books back to him that same day. And when I brought them, his students, they were in class and they came out of the class and they started looking at the books themselves. And they really wanted to be showed they could have a chance to read them in their course. They were really happy that he was buying them. They said, "Oh, these are the Kṛṣṇa consciousness books. We've read some of these before. These are really nice." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa, his all sinful reactions stopped. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇeti varṇa-dvayam.</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī says, "What nectar is there in these two alphabets, <span class="Italic">kṛṣ-ṇa!" Kṛṣṇeti varṇa-dvayam.</span> [break] ...greater enthusiasm you go on with book distribution. They will be benefited, and distributors also will be benefited. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">. Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to become quickly recognized by Kṛṣṇa, then make propaganda, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And once recognized by Kṛṣṇa, then your going back to home, back to Godhead, guaranteed. [break] ...took from London to here come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> How many hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> One the plane it took about ten hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten hours. From London to Chicago. Not much, ten hours. [break] ...staying at Bhaktivedanta Manor? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> We stayed there most of the time. And the first two weeks we stayed at Bury Place because there are about six schools that are in walking distance from the Bury Place temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everything is going right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Oh, yes, cultivating very nice. The president there, he is taking out the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party himself, and the whole temple has become very enthused by this. Bury Place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many devotees are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> Bury Place, there's about... There are three traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> parties. There are about maybe thirty devotees there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> And Bhaktivedanta Manor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> I think about maybe thirty-five. Some of the boys go to Scotland frequently. So they sort of share the devotees with the three temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Edinburgh. So you have been in Edinburgh University?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> No. I don't know. Prabhupāda, they have a program there with the Indians. The Indians are supporting the temple there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> The Indians, they're paying for the devotees' <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and supporting the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. <span class="Italic">Anna-dāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> They make vows to give a certain amount to help the devotees out every week. They have a big chart. One Indian might make a vow that he will pay for all the wheat or all the breakfast <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> for the devotees for that month, and he'll give that much money. (Prabhupāda laughs) It's very nice. They kind of compete with each other to see who's doing the most. They go out and make life members. They make, sometimes, five, six life members in one day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall go further? Our time is up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 6:30 now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then we must go. [break] Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we have heard that <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> is a inauspicious alignment of the planets and therefore one has to counteract this inauspiciousness by more chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, no. It is the most auspicious. And chanting is more effective. [break] Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember you were instructing once that all of your initiated disciples should chant twenty-five rounds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Minimum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Minimum on this day. Is that a rule that we should all follow in our temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are sixteen rounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I mean on <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī,</span> simply you should chant. No other business. <span class="Italic">Nirjala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No preaching work? Should they go out for preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, those who are preaching, not for them. Those who are sitting idle, or they... (laughter) [break] ...has no other regulation, simply preaching. A preacher is so exalted. He hasn't got to follow any regulation. But don't take it. (laughter) And actually if one is busy in preaching work, that is first-class. [break] ...not my manufactured word, my Guru Mahārāja, that the... That Mādhava Mahārāja, when he was a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> his name was Hayagrīva. So he was to go somewhere. So but he was sick. Guru Mahārāja was informed that he was sick and "Today is <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span> He cannot take his regular meals." So Guru Mahārāja said, "No. Let him take immediately meals and go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> For preaching. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...Mahārāja would sacrifice everything for preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. [break] He was not pleased with Bon Mahārāja, He could not do anything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...most pleased with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We must be sure of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless he is pleased, what I am worth? It is due to his pleasure. Otherwise what I am worth? Everyone says, "You have done wonderful." What can I do wonderful? It is by his pleasure it is going on. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> [break] Bon Mahārāja has written that, last line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That your accomplishment has been very great. He had to admit. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He admitted it publicly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No. He has written me a letter. I invited him. [break] Now, he has returned.</div>
