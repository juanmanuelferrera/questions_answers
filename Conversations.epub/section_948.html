<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one thing is that when they are so much careful, that means the book is reacting. Otherwise why they are so careful that they may not come? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, sometimes they specifically say, "The others may come, but that one man, we don't want him here." (laughs) He gets out twice as many books as anybody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many books, also not many books, why they are so much afraid of distributing these books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It means that the book is potent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It means that the books are potent. We are affecting the material energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere in government, India especially, they do not want this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the general tendency is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But people are appreciating, "Kṛṣṇa consciousness catches." They're now appreciating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Was that a recent article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the general people are taking it up more and more. I mean there is a growing number of interested persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he has written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not only are there numbers of us increasing, but there are many people who come once a week, once every month, who get magazines regularly. That number is increasing beyond what we can imagine, because it's due to the book distribution, Prabhupāda. We're coming due to two things, first the books, and second the association of devotees. But there's a general mass of people that are coming who are just getting the book, and they are beginning to follow simply on account of reading your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This is a big article. Wow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another magazine article, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rādhāvallabha's got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I asked, there's another very special magazine came out, and I asked Rādhāvallabha to bring it and present it to you. It's from New York, but I wanted him to read some of the things. He read the whole thing, it's a whole magazine devoted to meditation groups, and they have featured our society as the best. It's clear, our society was featured more than any others. They mentioned Maharishi and so many others, but they gave...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are also mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They gave us the most space in the magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They did it in sections. There was a bit about <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> there was a section about shaving the head, there's a whole section about Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> how to offer it and cook it and everything. It was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's getting it ready. He wants to read you certain things in the magazine. He likes to prepare things to discuss with you, Rādhāvallabha, controversial topics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that controversial? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's so nice, he reads things so on the walks, he can throw out scientific arguments and other things. He likes to do that. It's really funny, there's one article, one advertisement in the back of this magazine, meditation magazine. It says "Special offer: send in twenty-five dollars and you will learn how to do transcendental meditation in one evening. And if you are not satisfied, you get your money back, but you get to keep your own private <span class="Italic">mantra.</span>" This book is a real..., it really shows you what the whole scene on spiritual groups is, how phony they are. Except ours. Ours appears very legitimate from the magazine. But these others are complete hypocrisy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He especially canes Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, he hates him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They did an experiment, and they tried out..., if one chants... He claims that you have to have a special mantra that comes from him, and that will give you the bliss from transcendental meditation. But they did experiments where they just made up any <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> just a few words, and concentrated on that, and the effect was exactly the same-sleep. Sleep, they enter into a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Semiconscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, a very low conscious level. The metabolism is very much slowed down. The breathing and heart rate and everything goes right down, and they stay like that, completely relaxed, for twenty minutes, and then for a few minutes they come out. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can also do that; we'll hit them with our shoes. (laughter) For twenty minutes they can go unconsciousness. Free, we don't charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This opening comment in this magazine is very good, it says, "What is surprising about the International Society for Krishna Consciousness is not its conquest of the West, the USA in particular. The cultural impact of this institution, borne on the shoulders of Westerners in the main, has already reached amazing proportions in India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew. That's why they are afraid of you in India, Prabhupāda. The government is very much afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, government is alarmed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well how will they try to stop us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Through restrictive government(?). (door opens) Who is...? Let him come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Here he comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara Prabhu? Prabhupāda wanted to see that boy-Arjuna Mallick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I went to find him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I sent someone to look for him, they haven't come back. You haven't seen him? It would be nice, because Prabhupāda wanted to see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know him? Arjuna Mallick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I only saw him just this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just find him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But I have no idea where he's staying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 703 is the room number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara is looking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This first paragraph recognizes how in the last two years especially our esteem has improved. It says "One has to see for oneself..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that Sadajivitlal you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says about me that "Bhaktivedanta Swami has smeared the black carbon of all other swamis." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Black carbon. You know Sadajivitlal from Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He used to get very angry. He said, "I like your Prabhupāda very much, but why does he have to criticize all of our gurus?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now he is realizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because at Cross Maidan you were speaking very boldly that all these others are cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are cheating. Is there any meaning that you pay so many dollars and take the <span class="Italic">mantra</span>? <span class="Italic">Mantra</span> is such a thing for business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In this meditation magazine one of the things they sell, the special techniques is you take a ping-pong ball, ping-pong, you know, that table tennis? And you cut it in half and you place the two halves on your eyes, and then that is called <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll show you the picture when he brings the magazine. They show a person very seriously meditating on two halves of a ping-pong ball. You have to pay for it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Would you like to go up on the roof today, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda said the sun is too much. Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa, he's been doing all of our, he's practically done the whole arrangement for the <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā.</span> Jayānanda is building, and he has done all of the permits, advertising, publicity, the poster, working at least fifteen hours a day for the last month very hard, to make it a very successful festival. I was thinking, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that Haṁsadūta was telling me that he is planning to make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this article was dictated by Haṁsadūta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our interviewer came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was telling me that he was planning to make thousands of men, convert thousands of Indians. I was wondering, if thousands of Indians join us, how will the government feel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really, they won't stop us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they want to stop it, it will increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, right. Especially in Bengal, as soon as the Bengalis know that something is against the government, then they get very vehement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's encouraging when they try to resist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They call us <span class="Italic">sāhebs.</span> It says "What urges the <span class="Italic">sāhebs</span> and <span class="Italic">memasāhebs.</span>" That's how they refer to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Māyāpura temple is known as <span class="Italic">sāheb mandira.</span> In Vṛndāvana, English, <span class="Italic">iṁrejī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gopāla told me that the guesthouse is doing better. He said that only that eleven rooms right now are occupied by nonpaying guests, and out of the overall forty-four rooms, only four rooms are occupied by devotees. The devotees have been shifted elsewhere. And Guṇārṇava has been managing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa boy was in Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Stoka Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stoka, he has left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's back in Los Angeles now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not stick anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Whew! This picture of <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā</span> in London is very impressive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With smaller <span class="Italic">rathas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, palanquins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the crowd is bigger than ever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, huge crowd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> That's when we ah... Toṣaṇa, isn't that the picture that you showed them to show what our carts look like? He told the police, to get our permit, that our carts were like those little small <span class="Italic">rathas,</span> so that we could get the permit. He said that we were having a parade with hand-pulled floats. When they thought of hand-pulled floats, they thought of little wagons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're going to get a shock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's breaking the news to them slowly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We did that in Melbourne. But then gradually we let them see. Then they took us out for a trial run and everything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Note down in the account book. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...presents us as a bona fide Vaiṣṇava, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Vaiṣṇava cult. Says that the ISKCON center, the Māyāpura..., "ISKCON plans to build in Māyāpura a world center for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It will comprise an enormous..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This news has been very much advertised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When will we begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as we get the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The land is coming along?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The land is coming along?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are going ahead with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two officials are in great favor. One Mr. Choudhuri and Mr. Ganguli.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says that the temple will be so big that India has never seen such a huge temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Choudhuri's wife has challenged that "If you are Hindu, then you will do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To her husband. Oh. (laughter) It tells about, it quotes you as saying that how you began this movement. Two boys joined you, Chuck and Bruce-Brahmānanda and Acyutānanda, Charles Barnett and Bruce Scharf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charles is called Chuck?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi-kumāra:</span> It's called <span class="Italic">rajkacuri</span>. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Stuffed with <span class="Italic">dāl,</span> potato, tamarind sauce and sour cream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Ṛṣi's making up for lost time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you learned this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi-kumāra:</span> In Kailash Saksarya's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi-kumāra:</span> From Kailash Saksarya's cook. At least I learned something there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From that cook, Kailash's cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi-kumāra:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was very expert. In India, a girl, if she could cook nicely, then she is perfect. There is a ceremony, it is called <span class="Italic">bahubhat</span>(?). After marriage the girl comes to her father-in-law's house and there is a ceremony called <span class="Italic">bahubhat.</span> In that <span class="Italic">bahubhat,</span> the girl is to cook and distribute this food to all the relatives of her husband. If they say it is excellent, then she is accepted in this family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> What if they say it is not excellent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody says. (laughter) But the ceremony is made. The social system in India is that "If I do not accept your food, then I do not take you within my inner circle. You remain outside."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a great offense if you offer someone <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and they refuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means I am not accepting you as intimate. And if he accepts, then you cannot deny his friendship. About one hundreds years ago in Bengal in the aristocratic circle, the guests invited and very sumptuously food distributed, and then the gentlemen, guests, they come and see only, they will simply say "Oh, it is very nicely done." They'll not eat, and go away. Then the foodstuff will be distributed among the servants. This was aristocracy. They'll not eat, they will simply see and appreciate, "Oh, you have so many varieties, very nice." Then they'll go. And the household servants and others, they eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why didn't they eat it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the custom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> That is a dry philosophy. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen this article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other news, after Mars? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I haven't seen the newspapers yet. Might have some more, been taking pictures, photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda explained that the picture they took of Mars, they now say that there's..., they pointed out that there's a similar canyon, the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. So they were reporting like this, and Prabhupāda said this is an indication that actually it is a picture of, they have unintentionally they have let out the information that actually the photo is simply a photograph of the Grand Canyon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He gave an example. There's a man in his room at night, and he hears a noise. So he says "Oh, what's that sound?" And then back comes the reply, "I am not stealing." So no one asked the man to say what he was doing, but he unintentionally let it out what he was actually doing there. He just asked what the noise was, but he said "I am not stealing." So in the same way no one asked them to say anything about Arizona, but they let it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have disclosed unintentionally. That is going on. It is beyond their dream to go either to the moon planet or Mars planet. It is not possible. Not nowadays I say-I said it ten years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We're going to have a difficult time, with the scientists, about the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We're going to have a difficult time about this moon and the sun relationship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sunday, Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is a lifelong project. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody could answer, a simple question. (Hari-śauri explains "Sunday, Monday" question to Svarūpa Dāmodara in background(?)) According to Vedic astronomical calculations, sun is first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But does it have to do anything with distance, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Does it have to do anything with the distance? As the sun is recorded first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, according to them if sun is first, then it will be ninety-three million miles. And if the moon is still away, one million six hundred thousand miles, it becomes ninety-five million miles. How they are going ninety-five millions of miles in four days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, on that ground it is reasonable to know that they couldn't go there, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say they couldn't go there. Their asset is Arizona, that's all. All this propaganda is gone, and at last they wanted to satisfy by delivering some sand and rock, that's all. Actually the business was not done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say even if there's life on another planet, at most it could be bacteria.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense. If bacteria is there, why not others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well the thing is that if they say that there's other life, then they'd have to show it. But they don't know what's there because they've never been. So they have to show either there's no life and here's some rocks, which they got from this planet, or at most there's only bacteria, which they can also produce here and say it's there. But they can't show any advanced life because they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have never gone. Simply bluff. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi-kumāra:</span> Whenever they don't know something, they say it doesn't exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got evidence, our Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We have other informations other than <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "Gansfield effect." They give it a name and make it sound very important, and then sell it for a thousand dollars.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Gansfield. They say the Gansfield effect.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's an article about Maharishi. You want to read it? There's some points in here, it says "Profit without honor." This man hates Maharishi, says he's completely bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His picture is hateful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says "Profit without any honor." He quotes you in here. It says "Swami Prabhupāda, spiritual leader of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, and Bill Faill, Durban, South Africa, of the <span class="Italic">Natal Mercury Reporter,</span> had the following dialogue: (reads from magazine) Bill Faill: 'Do you think that Transcendental Meditation is helping people?' Prabhupāda: 'They do not know what real meditation is. Their meditation is simply a farce, another cheating process by the so-called swamis and yogis. So everyone is talking about meditation, but no one knows what meditation really is. These bluffers use the word <span class="Italic">meditation,</span> but they do not know the proper subject for meditation. They are simply talking bogus propaganda.' Bill Faill: 'But isn't meditation helpful in getting people to think straight?' Prabhupāda: 'No, real meditation means to achieve a state in which the mind is saturated by God consciousness.' "</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> There are some quotes here from people describing Maharishi's meditation. It says "A Denver housewife said, 'I turned off when I found that TM' " that's what they call Transcendental Meditation, " 'I turned off when I found that TM is trying to sell me meditation the same way Proctor and Gamble sells me soap.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gamble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Big soap company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Proctor and Gamble manufactures all kinds of soaps and detergents, so she's saying that the way they sell Transcendental Meditation is the same as the way they sell soap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very commercialized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They have here proof that his <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is no different than any ordinary sound. It says "In a Stanford Research Institute experiment, a group of TM trainees was compared to a control group who had been taught a fake <span class="Italic">mantra</span> that they believed would be effective. In both groups some subjects were able to bring unpleasant psychosomatic symptoms under control. Three of these dropped out of the TM training group. Their symptoms returned. Two dropped out of the control group; their symptoms came back too. Evidence like that suggests that whatever works in the TM system, it does not depend upon the mystical <span class="Italic">mantra.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let their men come and talk with our men in a public meeting. Then people will understand what is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have a catalog, Transcendental Meditation University, it's very well done, nice colors and anything, first class. They spend a lot of money and a lot of thoughts how to bring, how to attract the students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says their University's just closed down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, the one at Iowa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, the one in Majorca, in Spain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is the headquarters, Iowa, the main University. We saw the catalog. It contains everything, all sciences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This article explains that when he first appeared in public, he presented himself as a Hindu representative of Śaṅkarācārya's cult, but then later on he concocted this Transcendental Meditation, and then he presented it as a science so that he could get government grants to teach it in schools and things like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They have another guru here, Bhagwan Shri Rajneesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has also come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His group is big here. He's very popular in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Eighteen thousand disciples. He says, "It does not matter to whom one surrenders. The relevance is in the act of surrendering. But because the human mind sees things in terms of relationships, surrender to a guru is often useful. The guru is a step toward the impersonal divine, a step toward surrender to the existence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He makes a comment about <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> as well, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He initiates <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> they call themselves neo-<span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> "At initiation a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> receives a new name, an ochre robe and a <span class="Italic">mālā,</span> a string of beads holding a locket that frames a photograph of Bhagwan."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhagwan Rajneesh, not Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The one who says it's no necessity to have a spiritual master. He says "The picture is not mine. Had it been mine I would have hesitated to put it there. The picture only appears as mine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's word jugglery (laughter). The picture is of himself, he says "It is not me. If it was me I would not have put it there, it only appears to be me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They want something very cheap and easy to attain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Here's his method. First they engage in breathing. It says, "The really successful meditator sounds like an exhausted sea lion." He says "If you feel like dancing, dance, laugh, scream, sing, express your love, your hate, your anger, your jealousy. Do not condemn what happens; do not condone it. Just go mad. Express whatever is within you totally, intensity." And here's his <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> "Who who who." That's his <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were doing this in Bhopal. In Bhopal, we were there when we had our Jeeps. So in the same place we were staying they let this group Rajneesh do it. So they were going with that mantra, "Who who." So we were standing out from the balcony shouting, "Kṛṣṇa, that's who." Every morning they would do that meditation, and we would answer "Kṛṣṇa." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They call his method "chaotic meditation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the heading, it says "Chaotic Meditation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's the name of it. After they go "Who who who who who who..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about..., what they have written about us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> About us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A big article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Everything is favorable. They didn't say one bad thing about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare. The group above are performing a <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> the chanting of the names of Kṛṣṇa, the Vedic Deity they believe to be the supreme personification of Godhead. They are shown before the doorway of one Astor Plaza in Manhattan's Times Square area. Their chant, increasingly familiar on street corners in all large cities across the country, runs, 'Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.' These Kṛṣṇa devotees belong to the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, ISKCON, less formally known as the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement and still less formally to the man in the street as the Harry Kṛṣṇas." (laughter) Actually, Prabhupāda, one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harry Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think that we're worshiping a person, some material man by the name of Harry Kṛṣṇa. They think that your name is Harry Kṛṣṇa. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> In Boston they once wrote an article in the newspaper, the <span class="Italic">Boston Globe,</span> they said "I walked into the temple room and there he was, a big picture of Harry Kṛṣṇa sitting on a big throne." (laughter) On the <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Harry is an English...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harry, Harrison, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They are saying Kṛṣṇa's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I read more? "There are several hundred thousand members of the movement, several hundred thousand members of the movement throughout the world. Ten thousand in New York City alone." Actually, there are at least ten thousand followers. "Of these, about a hundred and fifty are full-time students and live at 340 West Fifty-fifth Street, an eleven-story former Josephine Baird Home of the Roman Catholic Carmelite Nuns." This was a nunnery. "The Hare Kṛṣṇa center on West Fifty-fifth Street draws about five hundred lay devotees and curiosity-seekers from the metropolitan area every Sunday. Open house begins at five p.m. A great drawing card is the serving of <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> food specially prepared for and offered to Lord Kṛṣṇa before being distributed to the public. The eating of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>, (see the article, "Food of the Gods" on a later page), is believed by members of the movement to convey important spiritual benefits-for example, the cleansing of <span class="Italic">karma</span> due to past sins. Movement members are not unaware of the more immediate and mundane effect. '<span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> is our secret weapon,' said Alaṅkāra dāsa, spokesman for the center. 'It gets them in here, and then they can get the message.' Les Tursley, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami, India-based senior member of the movement, has said of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in his country..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They think you're an Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think I'm an Indian. " 'If anyone comes around to our <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution program, that means he is hungry. If he is hungry, that means he cannot listen to our philosophy. If his hunger is not satisfied, he'll never become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the point. If we just went around with a program of speaking and <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they would come once or twice but they wouldn't see its practical value. But if you give them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> daily with <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and speaking, eventually you can convince them. Look, this is our most practical way of life. Why don't you come and live with us completely and work with us? ' " That's a quote from an article in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> "Though food is far more plentiful in the United States than in India, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> appeal seems to work its magic here just as well. The entire movement began only ten years ago in a storefront temple in Manhattan's Lower East Side. Today it owns the largest publishing house of Hindu classics, many in demand for leading university courses. The Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in Los Angeles, the world's largest, last year's gross of one million dollars; incense-producing Spiritual Sky Scented Products Company; and Kṛṣṇa Fashions Incorporated, a wholesale clothing manufacturer. An important portion of the movement's income comes from the contribution of lay devotees, who are successful businessmen. More comes from street-corner solicitation of alms by devotees during <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> How significant the last is, was shown recently by the closing down of elevator service in the New York center. 'A lot of us are going on pilgrimage to India,' said Alaṅkāra dāsa. 'There won't be many around to beg. These elevators cost us $2,200 a month to run. So we're cutting down except for essential services.' " We don't do that anymore. That was the previous mismanagement. Someone had the idea that if you turn off the elevator, that's very good, but I told him if you're not going to run the elevator, why did you move here? They had people walking up eleven stories, and it was crazy, just to save... Anyway, "These include moving foodstuffs and milk into the building. Much of the food comes from the 350-acre ISKCON-owned dairy farm in Academia, Pennsylvania, one of the six similar facilities in this country and Canada." They show pictures of devotees in the temple, devotees taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and two lady devotees. "The <span class="Italic">yoga,</span>" it says under the caption, "monks take breakfast by hand in rows on the dining area floor." Here it says "Saried women devotees dwell in cloister atmosphere of the center." Then "The yoga of devotion: <span class="Italic">Tilaka</span> of clay paste marks the devotee as a member of ISKCON sect. Central shrine in the temple is the focal point of twice a day services." A picture of Rādhā-Govinda. " 'Our life is our meditation' said a <span class="Italic">śikhā</span>-ed, saffron-clad monk in the Hare Kṛṣṇa center. 'Everything we do is offered to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but in addition to that there is the personal chanting, most...' [break] ...slung from the devotee's neck. He often counts the beads without taking his hand from the pouch. In the early hours the Hare Kṛṣṇa center buzzes with a droning sound, difficult to identify by the stranger who does not know that it comes from the monks, who are beginning their required sixteen rounds." They have given everything very detailed. "The personal chanting sometimes occurs in unusual situations-while escorting a visitor to the center, while waiting to complete a phone call, or even during pauses in a conversation." (laughter) Devotees are always chanting. " 'The <span class="Italic">mahāmantra</span> is the only <span class="Italic">mantra</span> needed' the devotee says. Besides the sixteen rounds, devotees are expected to observe four rules. They must abstain from meat-eating, intoxication, gambling and illicit sex. Illicit sex is defined as any sexual act other than that intended for procreation. Sex outside of marriage is forbidden. Married, full-time devotees may have sexual relationship once a month at a time propitious for procreation. All the devotee's activities are regarded as <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> the yoga of devotion. He regards everything he does as service to God. The name he is given at initiation is followed by the word <span class="Italic">dāsa,</span> 'a servant.' Full-time ISKCON devotees adopt Vedic dress, one objective being to keep others aware of Kṛṣṇa. Women wear <span class="Italic">saris,</span> the men <span class="Italic">dhotis</span>; both may wear shawls. The men shave their heads except for single lock of hair at the back. (See the article, "The Kṛṣṇa Cut.") The lock, called a <span class="Italic">śikhā,</span> identifies the followers of Kṛṣṇa." Actually no one can imitate us because no one wants to give up their hair, so no one will try to make believe they are devotees. "Shaving the head announces renunciation of material pleasures. The <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> is a mark made with clay-two narrow vertical stripes on the forehead meeting in a triangular swatch on the bridge of the nose. It identifies the body as a temple to be used only in the service of God. Full-time students follow a rigorously monastic life. They arise at four a.m. in the morning, begin four hours of prayer and chanting. At nine o'clock they have breakfast, seated cross-legged on mats on the floor. The men eat apart from the women. During the day devotees work at various preaching programs or at regular jobs. At seven p.m. devotional services are held in the center's temple. In Manhattan this features an ornate shrine including representations of Kṛṣṇa and His consort, Rādhā. Both are costumed sumptuously with elaborate care; both wear festoons of flowers. Visitors are cautioned, 'When you go in the temple room remember that these statues you see are not representations of the Deities, they <span class="Italic">are</span> the Deities. Kṛṣṇa is in everything, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere.' Temple <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>." There's a picture. "Eleven-story New York sect's center is former Carmelite Baird home." Picture of the temple. "Services in the temple are attended by about five hundred every Sunday. Many of these are from New York's Hindu population. Frequently husbands bring their pregnant wives, dedicating their unborn child to Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> begins with the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mahāmantra,</span> slowly at first and melodiously. Later the chant will speed up as the spirit of the devotion spreads. Often the most rapid and intense chanting is done by a hard-core knot of <span class="Italic">dhoti-</span>ed men before the curtains of the shrine." The devotees get in one group and start... (laughter) Hard-core devotees. "The rhythm approaches that of an express train, and the atmosphere is apt to remind a lay visitor of an old-fashioned football rally. Some of the onlookers try to keep up with the central group, clapping their hands, swaying their bodies, throwing arms upwards and, among the younger, adapting modern dance steps to the rhythm. When the shrine curtains are drawn back, devotees kneel and press their foreheads..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has introduced this peculiar dancing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It just evolved. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We were speaking about that the other day. It's changed from the original dancing that you showed us to something else. Too much like the modern dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. I think this is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Shall I read on? "The service has become..." What way should we dance, Śrīla Prabhupāda? With our hands outstretched? Sometimes the devotees like to jump around. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In ecstasy one can do anything, that is another... But artificially to do something is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if one feels like jumping, it is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything artificial is not required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So running back and forth is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that should not be an artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We don't dance for show, we dance for the pleasure of the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we're not professional dancers. "The service has become so frenetic that the almost folksy, matter of fact preaching of the Swami makes a stark contrast. 'Some people are against us because they say we teach children to smile. Well isn't that too bad. We make children smile-we are bad. We try to teach them that life should be a joyful thing, we're evil. Well that's too bad, isn't it? ' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Who's that? That's crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is theory.(?) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has not returned with the key?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who? Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Still more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. "After the sermon, more chanting. Now it really becomes frantic, and even compelling. Many curious first-time visitors begin to take up the <span class="Italic">mahāmantra</span> chant. The hard-core group at the shrine seems to be completely carried away. The terrazo floor literally vibrates. Gradually the crowd begins to thin. Other things are happening in the center. On the third floor there is a traditional Vedic play in costume, acted with enthusiasm." (sound of <span class="Italic">kīrtana)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's going downstairs somewhere, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They're getting everybody together to go out on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says here, "On the second floor there is a store which attracts many visitors who want to buy Indian costumes, jewelry and the movement's books. <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> is served in the basement restaurant. Visitors eat at tables in the same area where monks had breakfast on the floor. The <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> features Hindu dishes served in the compartments of plasticized paper mess trays." Then it goes on. Now there's another article about you. Why are they holding a <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They're getting a <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party together to go out on <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span> down at Times Square (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Prabhupāda, <span class="Italic">ācārya</span>-founder, born Abhay Caran De in India in 1895, the founder, future founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> spiritual leader of ISKCON, came under the spiritual direction of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja, ascetic scholar and preacher who had devoted his life to the spread of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Three years later, shortly before he died, Bhaktisiddhānta ordered Abhay to spread the Kṛṣṇa faith in the English language. One of the ways that Abhay, now known as Prabhupāda-'one at whose feet masters sit'-did that was to begin to translate the classic Vedic literature, but it was not until thirty years after he was charged by his spiritual mentor that he was able to make a trip to the United States. He arrived in Boston in September, 1965, a spry but grim-faced passenger of seventy years on the steamer <span class="Italic">Jaladuta.</span> He had forty rupees in his pocket and a metal suitcase full of his books and translations. Finding his way to New York City, he set up a storefront temple at 26 Second Avenue in the East Village section. Gradually he drew a small coterie of students around him, mostly through his preaching in Tompkinson Park. As his movement grew, he found backers among his converts. Hare Kṛṣṇa centers were established in Boston, Buffalo and San Francisco, and an appreciation of Prabhupāda's Vedic translations by American university authorities, Columbia, Princeton, Yale professors among others, permitted the establishment of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust in Los Angeles. The Trust launched a promotion of Prabhupāda's translations and original works under the logo of the Living Library of Transcendental Knowledge. Remarkably, in the face of a worldwide economic recession, the Trust's book and magazine sales reached nine million in 1975, up 34.5 percent over 1974. Some of this was due to the determined promotion of groups such as the hundred-man Rādhā-Dāmodara group which criss-crosses the country in six Greyhound-type buses and ten vans giving lectures and <span class="Italic">kīrtanas</span> at college university campuses. Now eighty-one years old, Prabhupāda still works at his writings and the spiritual direction of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. His translation of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> the most widely used in the Western world, is in great demand by professors of Indology and Vedic literature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has given advertisement for our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, very favorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The amazing thing is that he's an impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonalist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The man who wrote all of these articles, he's an impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's a picture of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he's American?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> He thinks there are different types of meditation that all work, and ours is one type, bona fide, that works. There are also other types.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The article goes on-I don't know if you want to hear it all. You want to hear it? Okay. Here's this thing called "Who is Kṛṣṇa?" "Kṛṣṇa, viewed by ISKCON as the Supreme Personification of Godhead, is said to have many pastimes in which He assumes different appearances. One such is that of Gopālajī, the cowherd boy-see picture, cowherd boy-He can appear in other forms such as four-armed Nārāyaṇa. Most often Kṛṣṇa is portrayed as having light blue skin and, by Western standards, a soft and effeminate physique. He is said to be full in the six opulences: beauty, strength, fame, wealth, knowledge and renunciation. He is said to be all-attractive. Kṛṣṇa incarnates on one planet after another in infinite universes. The last time He appeared on earth as Kṛṣṇa was five thousand years ago. He will not return in that form for another four hundred thousand years, but five hundred years ago He appeared in His incarnation of Lord Caitanya, who taught people of the <span class="Italic">mahāmantra</span> and started the Kṛṣṇa consciousness in its present state. According to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa hungers for the devotion of His followers." Very nicely put. "This devotion in its pure sense takes the form of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> the dedication of one's every action to Kṛṣṇa. Thus to use one's sense for one's own pleasure is to deny Kṛṣṇa devotion and accumulate negative <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Kṛṣṇa has a consort, Rādhā, but She is considered only as an extension of His own pleasure principle, since He is all things. It is through Her intercession that devotees seek favors from Kṛṣṇa. According to ISKCON, Kṛṣṇa is the same God worshiped as Jehovah, Allah and so on." That is the explanation of who Kṛṣṇa is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He could write for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He could write for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good. Then there is a part called "Hare Kṛṣṇa Meditation." "The Hare Kṛṣṇaś practice <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> the yoga of devotion. They have their <span class="Italic">mahāmantra,</span> continual recitation of which will have a meditative effect. By integrating recitation of the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> with a life of rigidly formulated devotional activities, it would seem that devotees actually live their meditation. Such a life of living meditation is not without parallel in secular fields. It is believed that the spiritual form of alchemy served this purpose; that is, an alchemist repeated the same experimental routine over and over until it became automatized, though still requiring some slight personal involvement." He's getting a little far out here. "It was expected that the result..." Anyway, "...practitioners of Western magical disciplines sought for similar results. Meditation takes effect in terms of the ambiance in which it is practiced. In the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement there are certain to be transcendental experiences. They would be in accord with Vedic teachings, but their exact nature has not proven easy of discovery, since devotees insist that their sole aim in life is to be of service to Kṛṣṇa." We're not interested in experiencing all these special things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very nice point. Then there's a part about the Kṛṣṇa cut. Says here, "Badge. The badge of the monks is the single lock that hangs from a rear of shaven head. As a precisely trimmed <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> is a matter of pride, monks often cooperate in shaving one another. Hair is buzzed off by clipper (left side), leaving a bristly surface (center)"-shows the bristly surface.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has taken photograph of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughter) Yes. "...which is lathered up and shaved with a safety razor (right side). Even more striking than their saffron <span class="Italic">dhotis</span> and shawls is the ISKCON men's practice of shaving their heads with the exception of one long lock in the rear, known as the <span class="Italic">śikhā.</span> The first reaction of the layman is "Why do they do it?" The next is "How do they do it?" The Hare Kṛṣṇaś themselves advance three different answers to the first question. Some say that in countries that have hot climates, the religious have always shaved their heads to insure cleanliness. A clean body reflects a pure spirit."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One letter should be written to him that "You have taken so much trouble to describe Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, so thank you for your patience. Now we shall request you to read our books and review it. That will be real presentation of the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement. Now you have studied superficially, and if you seriously study our books, you'll get more knowledge and you'll be able to give description of the movement more definitely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want to hear what else he has to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Umhm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Others insist that the style of shaving the head identifies devotees of various spiritual orders. The long <span class="Italic">śikhās</span> marks a man as a follower of Kṛṣṇa. Still another group says that the head-shaving simply stands for renunciation of the material world, its values and its pleasures. One or more of those reasons may be the true one. Possibly all of them have a multi-determined, have multi-determined the Kṛṣṇa cut. The how of the cut is simplicity itself. Commonly two men cut each others hair. Our pictures show how. Phase one of the cutting, known as the buzz-off, is done with ordinary..." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buzz off? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. "...is done with ordinary hair clippers. The post buzz-off effect..." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> This guy's made a science out of it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "...shown in the second picture. Next, the prickly sconce."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prickly sconce. Prickly means short-haired, and sconce means...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Look it up in the dictionary. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> People like to think they are scientific like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says "the prickly sconce is lathered up with an old-fashioned mug and brush and shaved with a safety razor. It is considered of paramount importance that the base of the <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> be shaved round evenly. The shavee sometimes shows some nervousness about this." He gets nervous that they'll cut his <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> off. This man has caught every detail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good writer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he's a good one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It says "Sconce: crown of head." It's an old term for the crown of the head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a special article about <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> Prabhupāda, called "Food for the Gods." "Of all the ways of getting to heaven, or <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> or whatever your ideal place may be, the Hare Kṛṣṇa way is one of the most pleasant. Believers of this faith are convinced that you can eat your way into higher spiritual realms. Of course, this doesn't mean that food itself is sacred and the more you eat the holier you are. To begin with, there is a strict prohibition against the killing of animals, so meat, fish and eggs are not included in the diet at all of the Kṛṣṇa devotees. Furthermore, there are many special rules for preparing the food which may be offered to Kṛṣṇa to be blessed by Him and therefore to bring blessings to anyone who partakes of it." Should I read this whole article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um, hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "The recipes given below, taken from the <span class="Italic">Hare Kṛṣṇa Cookbook</span>'-another good advertisement, and they give you at least three or four recipes in here. They give recipes for, the recipes are for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Anyway, he has given more pages for our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, he's given us three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve pages. And the whole magazine, including many advertisements..., actually the nonadvertised part is about fifty-five pages, of which we have twelve. At least one fifth of the book is for Hare Kṛṣṇa. The other groups only have three pages, four pages. And he blasts them mostly. Some of them are really nonsense. Here's one called the Deichman experiment. You stare at a vase...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, this is another one. Deichman experiment. Then they have one about Zen Buddhism, it shows Zen meditation. Here's a Zen master sitting in front of a basketball. I don't know why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They have a meditation that they call Zen basketball.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> We went to one seminar once when they were teaching Zen basketball.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's another one, "Hypnotism or Meditation." A hypnotist discusses a question that many face. Because they accuse that we're hypnotizing, so they're trying to distinguish in this article what is hypnotism, what is meditation. Then here's another one, "The Art of Awareness." This woman is supposed to be a great transcendental artist. You can see some of her famous pictures. Here's a picture called "Congregations of Souls." And here's another picture called "Temple Stones." Then this is the Gansfield effect. (laughter) Ping-pong balls. Says here "The apparently pop-eyed lady is not a visitor from another dimension nor the victim of a sudden surprise. She is the subject of an experiment into the nature of meditation and some of the effects of the processes. The ping-pong ball halves present a completely continuous visual field. There's no object in it that can hold her attention. After staring at the insides of the ping-pong balls for a while, she will begin to feel peaceful and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually she does?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, that's the meditation. They put the ping-pong ball, and then it describes, "She will feel peaceful and serene. At the same time she may not be able to tell whether her eyes are open or closed. She will see neither white nor black nor any shade in between. She will have the experience of not seeing. At that point, which the subject in this kind..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With the eyes closed, then not seeing is there already. (laughter) What is the use of meditating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You aren't going to see very much with two ping-pong balls over your eyes, are you? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "The white hemispheres covering her eyes are halves of ping-pong balls. The wires lead off to an electroencephalograph." E.E.G. It keeps a record of changes in her brainwave output. "At that point when she is not seeing, which subjects in this kind of experiment call 'blanking out,' the electroencephalograph will record a brainwave output well into the alpha range." They also tell you how to make the Gansfield, how to cut the... It shows a ping pong ball and a knife. (laughter) This guy is weird.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This thing about alpha range, this is becoming a big thing. They think that if a person gets into this alpha range of brain stimulation, then his meditation is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're trying to figure it all out scientifically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They're trying to use all kinds of machines and wires to measure consciousness. They have one group that has tin cans attached to wires, and they hold them in their hand, and then they measure it on the machine as they meditate. And when they meditate right, the needle on the machine goes right in the middle, and they think they have achieved perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here is an article called "Travels Beyond the Body: what is it that travels, and what is it that's seen?" They're talking about traveling beyond your body. Here's an advertisement, "Because I have taken the mystery out of transcendental meditation, I will teach you to master transcendental meditation in a single evening." "About the author." Then it says, "Free private <span class="Italic">mantra</span> based on your own name, selected by the great Norbell, translated by his special Sanskrit system, so that no one else in America has the same <span class="Italic">mantra</span> twice. No other system of transcendental meditation..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this? Maharishi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Maharishi Mahesh Yogi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, this is competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, this isn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This man says "Norbell, for over thirty years his unrelenting thirst for spiritual fulfillment has taken him to the most remote corners of the globe to finally become one of the few Westerners in our time who has ever gained acceptance as an equal among the holy masters of both India and Tibet. He has also mastered the scientific secrets of Western knowledge in America's most highly regarded universities. In America alone over the past decade, tens of thousands have come to Carnegie Hall in New York and dozens of other centers of public hearing all to hear him." He says, "Meditation can make this claim alone, and it's yours to keep. Your own <span class="Italic">mantra</span> free, even if you return the report itself. Mail this coupon at no risk today. 'Gentlemen, please rush me a copy of Norbell's five minute de-mystified transcendental meditation.' " (laughter) De-mystified, taking the mystery out. "Confidential report. 'I enclose nine dollars and ninety-eight cents in full payment. I understand that I may examine this confidential report for thirty days at your risk or money back. Also send me my own private <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> specially selected for me by Master Norbell and mine absolutely free, even if I return the report with every cent of my money back.' " It says here-these are the benefits of the <span class="Italic">mantra</span>-one of the benefits is, it says here, one of the benefits, "and as an extra benefit of such heightened personal magnetism, a simple shift in the focus of your daily meditations can give you great new sexual and romantic powers, new joys in love."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're all cheaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's another group called Arika.(?) This Arika(?) costs three thousand dollars, this process. They charge three thousand dollars for a ninety-day course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Part of their whole meditation is they have cocktail parties. They drink liquor and they have these therapy, and they charge him money to go to a cocktail party, they call it yoga<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, it's got a good article about us. You want to keep it to show guests who come the article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Anyone who reads that magazine will immediately become attracted to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there's no comparison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's got the best article I've ever seen though, about us, in great detail. It really reports the details.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. This is also good article. [break] Hm! Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa, where is the key? Key? Distribute this <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can see how he's cooking very..., he's the most expert I've ever seen, and he knows these special preparations. He can cook many varieties of <span class="Italic">kacuri.</span> (end)</div>
