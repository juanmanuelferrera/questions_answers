<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is special advantage of this age. People are very much fallen from spiritual standard, and to fall down from the spiritual standard means to spoil the humanity. There is no education on this point. That is Vedic culture. Most of them, they do not believe that there is soul, spirit soul, and human life is meant for understanding it and make progress on that platform. Most of them, they do not know. There is no education, I think so. Everyone reads <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> mostly, but they do not understand the first lesson. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Nobody understands. What is your understanding about this transmigration of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We consider that man gets life after death according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Do you believe on this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We have this belief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the preparation? If we believe that we have to get another life after death, then what preparation we have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Preparation? We... The real truth is we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is I am saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> This is what we would like to know from... (microphone rattling) ...the learned people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that is our duty, provided you want to learn it. But practically they are not interested. That is the pity of the situation. They... Nature's law is there, but they do not care for the nature's law. They are so irresponsible.</div>
<div class="Verse">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br class="calibre2"/>guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br class="calibre2"/>kartāham iti manyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.27]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Everything is being done by nature's law, and we are strictly under nature's law. Still, we are thinking independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Nature's laws are inexorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We cannot surpass. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> This nature's law is so strict, you cannot disobey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We can't bend it. It is un... inevitable, inexorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, inexorable. Yes, yes, inexorable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> And nobody can interfere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> God alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God can do anything. He is all-powerful. That is only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But does He interfere... Does he intervene in our actions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> I mean, God, does He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. God interferes if you are a devotee. Otherwise, you have to undergo the laws of nature. <span class="Italic">Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">. Karma,</span> according to your <span class="Italic">karma,</span> you are conducted by the laws of nature. Just like if you touch fire, the laws of nature is: it will burn. Even a child touches the fire, there is no excuse. The laws of nature will not excuse a child, that "This child does not know it has touched the fire. Let it not be burned." No. Ignorance is no excuse. You cannot surpass or avoid laws of nature. It is not possible. If you can eat one <span class="Italic">chātā,</span>(?) and if you eat little more, then there will be trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Then what about miracles performed by so many people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. Nobody can play anything. Magician also can make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Interfere with the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can. It is all foolishness, all rascaldom. They are all rascals and who understands miracle, they are also rascals. Laws of nature cannot be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> There may be several laws which we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many laws. What do you know? You do not know anything. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We do not know. Then I say those miracles may be possible according to those laws that we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no miracle. If you touch fire, it will burn, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Swamiji, is <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> enough to have liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-mārga...</span> First of all, you must know what is liberation. What do you mean by liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Jīvan-mukta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> When feeling one with the consciousness, world consciousness, universal soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Universal soul is spirit, and you are also spirit. That sense, you are one. But universal soul is different from you. Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that there are two souls within the body. One soul is the individual soul, and the other soul is the Supersoul. That Supersoul is universal soul, and the individual soul, you are individual soul. As soul, the quality is the same, but you are individual soul, and Lord is universal soul. There, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated clearly, <span class="Italic">kṣetra-kṣetrajña. Kṣetrajña</span> is the soul; <span class="Italic">kṣetra</span> is this body. So <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata:</span> "I am also <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña,</span> soul, but <span class="Italic">sarva-kṣetreṣu.</span> You individual soul, you know the pleasure, pains, of your body, but you do not know what are the pleasure and pains of my body." Do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are individual. You know the pleasure and pains of your body. I know the pleasure and pains of my body. But there is another soul; that is Supersoul. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> He knows your pleasure, pains. He knows my pleasure and pains. He knows everyone's pleasure and pains. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> Therefore, as soul they are one in quality, but in consciousness they're different. He knows everyone's pleasure and pains; I know my pleasure and pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> My humble prayer was that by doing <span class="Italic">japa,</span> by doing meditation, by doing <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga,</span> need we go to <span class="Italic">jñāna-mārga</span> also, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> is enough by itself? That was my humble supplication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-mārga</span> is enough. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-mārga</span> means it includes everything. Without <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> The <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20];</span> that is real <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> If you... <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> If you understand your position, then it is <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> If you do not understand your position, then where is <span class="Italic">jñāna?</span> Do you follow? Therefore Bhagavān says, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> When... So long you are <span class="Italic">ajñāna,</span> in ignorance, you cannot be happy. You cannot be happy. But when you are in <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> then you'll be happy. That is the symptom of becoming <span class="Italic">jñānī. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">. Ātmā </span> becomes very happy. <span class="Italic">Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> He has no more any lamentation and hankering. There are two things in this material world. We are hankering after something which we do not possess, and we are lamenting for something which we possessed and we have lost. This is the disease, material disease. So when one comes to the platform of <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> then he has no more such disease, hankering and lamenting. Here the whole world is going on, lamenting and hankering. So <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> means <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati</span> and <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> And here, so long we are on the material platform, we are not <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> We are thinking, "You are different from me; I am different from you. My interest is first." You are thinking your interest is first and so on, so on. So not <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> But when you become actually <span class="Italic">jñānī, brahma-bhūtaḥ, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> When you are in distress, <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu,</span> <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> then <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> begins. <span class="Italic">Mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not so easy thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> depends on <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> It cannot be immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means when one understands his real position, means all misunderstanding gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Ajñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> When there is that last <span class="Italic">śloka</span> in the Eighteenth <span class="Italic">adhyāya, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can do unless you understand your position? When you understand your position, that "I am eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa," then you can do that. If I say immediately, "Mr. Such-and-such, you give up everything. You become... Surrender unto me." Will you do? No, you'll not do. But when you understand your position-"Yes, it is my duty"-then you'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta</span> is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> means first of all you understand your identity. You are now identifying yourself as Indian, or as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> or as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> or white, or black, and so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> My first identification is my own body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is <span class="Italic">ajñāna.</span> So long you are identifying with the body, you are no better than the animal. So we are doing that. We are fighting. "I am Indian. You are Englishman. You are this. You are that. You are..." Simply we are fighting, like cats and dogs, they fight. So that is <span class="Italic">ajñāna.</span> How you can be <span class="Italic">prasannātmā?</span> So when one becomes actually situated in spiritual life, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the... In this way when you make further progress, when you actually understand that you are eternal servant of God, then you surrender. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This situation takes many, many births to cultivate. And when he actually understands, <span class="Italic">jñānavān-</span>not fools, rascals-then <span class="Italic">māṁ prapadyate, vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is very rare to be found. So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not so easy. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> It is not so easy. It takes many, many births to come to the understanding that <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">. Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ bhajanty ananya manasaḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Does the soul which passes from body to body, does it or he experience the pains and pleasures of my body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. You just strike one dog-"Ka! Ka! Ka!" Why? Does not feel pain? And Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose has proved even the trees, they feel pains and pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> It may be the soul which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the stage. It is stage. Just like the tree. If you cut, it does not feel so much pains and pleasure as a human being. It is the development of consciousness. So in human form of body the consciousness is developed. Therefore he can understand what is his position. And therefore for human being there are <span class="Italic">śāstras-</span>the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas-</span>to understand his position. The tree cannot take advantage of the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> A cat cannot take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Even an animal cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if we do not take advantage of the opportunity of understanding my identification, then we are committing suicide, jumping like cats and dogs, that's all. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Such persons have been described as <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ. Go</span> means cows, and <span class="Italic">khara</span> means ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Khara</span> means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ass. I think this <span class="Italic">khara</span> is word is used by <span class="Italic">Urdu.</span> <span class="Italic">Phir vamusthi vrsti kharaḥ.</span> (little discussion in <span class="Italic">Urdu</span> or Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who identifies his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍha,</span> you explained last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is going on. That's it, that we should take advantage of this human form of life, and we must know what is our position, why we are in this material world. I am this body or so... So many things. This is called <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> But nobody is interested. That is the effect of bad education. And especially in the Western countries, they do not believe in the next birth. They do not believe, although it is very clearly pointed out by Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> "The body is changing from baby body, is coming, becoming a boy, a boy is becoming a young man, young man is becoming middle-aged man, and the middle-aged man is becoming old man." The body is changing every moment, and still, they do not believe. Every one of us, we know that we had a childhood body, a boy's body. Where is that body? That body is gone. I am existing, but the body is not existing. Therefore I have changed body. This simple word, they do not understand. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">mūḍha. </span>Kṛṣṇa is pointing out, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Similarly, there is after this, after so-called death, the soul changes to another body, and He still further clearly says, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre:</span> [Bg. 2.20] "After the destruction of this body, the person is not killed. He's not dead." <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit.</span> These things are there, but nobody understands. And they're very good scholar, big, big student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But these things they do not understand. And they're writing very, very big, big comments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> In theory everybody believes it, that <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What is that nonsense theory? We must know it actually. What is the use of theory? Theory is no good. You must know factually. That is knowledge. Theory is not knowledge. Anyone can put forward some nonsense theory. That is not knowledge. Knowledge means factual. That is... So we have to take knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> How To attain that knowledge then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also, Kṛṣṇa is explaining. Why don't you take it? The knowledge is there, but you refuse to accept. So what is fault? Whose fault it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> How should I persuade myself that that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you don't persuade, nobody can induce you to persuade. If you are obstinate, who can persuade you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Well, the devil persists. (?) I try to believe he persists. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must agree. Therefore it is advised, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet, samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all, you have to surrender. But if you don't surrender, how you'll get knowledge? If you think you are very big man, then how you get knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No, we don't think that we are big men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, everyone thinks that, not you. I don't say particular. Everyone thinks, "I know everything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No, no. We think that we are ignorant, petty creatures. Correct. And we know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you think so, that you are ignorant petty creatures, then you take knowledge from the authority. Why don't you take it? What is the meaning that you think you are ignorant petty creature, at the same time, when the most learned person is giving you knowledge, Kṛṣṇa, you don't take it? What kind of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But there are so many authorities presented to me. But there is the <span class="Italic">Bible,</span> there is the <span class="Italic">Koran,</span> there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, you are born in India. Why you are jumping to <span class="Italic">Bible?</span> (laughter) This is another foolishness. You take care of your own house. You are jumping like monkey to <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> In our own house there are quite a few <span class="Italic">dharmas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span> You have to follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> In our country there are <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, those who are recognized authority. <span class="Italic">Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ācāryopāsanam.</span> You have to worship the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (6):</span> You have to look up your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The <span class="Italic">ācārya's paramparā</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> There is no dearth of <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> in India. There is <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> Rajneesh, there is <span class="Italic">ācārya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> and there are fools also. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is there, and fools are there also. The agnostics are there. They will not accept any <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> You accept some <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Why you become skeptic? At least, we have to accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Why don't you accept Him? If you are embarrassed whom to select <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> so who can be better <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> than Kṛṣṇa? Why don't you accept Him? That means you want to avoid under some plea. Otherwise there is <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> If you don't believe in other <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> you take at least Kṛṣṇa who is accepted by all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Either Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, or anyone, will they not accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme teacher? Whole world is understanding Kṛṣṇa is the supreme teacher. At least at the present moment they are accepting. We are selling our books daily five to six <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth, only these Kṛṣṇa consciousness books. And in our country we do not accept Kṛṣṇa as the supreme <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> What is this? That is our misfortune. Kṛṣṇa is recognized <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> There is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> Sir, (Hindi?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa also says, <span class="Italic">ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyāt. Ācāryaṁ māṁ vijānīyān nāvamanyeta karhicit</span> [SB 11.17.27]<span class="Italic">. Ācārya</span> and Kṛṣṇa-identical. Who is <span class="Italic">ācārya?</span> Who speaks on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, he is <span class="Italic">ācārya. Ācārya</span> means one who speaks on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Because Kṛṣṇa never wrote any book...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He spoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> ...therefore we have to depend upon His...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Kṛṣṇa did not write, but Kṛṣṇa spoke. If you speak and if I note down and write, what is the difference? Because you did not see, therefore it is not good? He spoke and I note down, er, you note down. Then it is as good. Kṛṣṇa was speaking, and Sañjaya was noting, and that was written by Vyāsadeva in the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> So what is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> That is one disclosure. That is one only <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sufficient. First of all, you understand few lines of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā;</span> then jump over other. About this only, one line, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> if you simply understand this one line, your life will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Kindly explain this line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This line, it is clear, that you have to change this body. Have you got any objection to take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are not serious, "What kind of body I am going to get?" Here is a body, tree. If you are going to accept a body like this, just how miserable it will be. Why you are not afraid? Just like if you want to go from here, Chandigarh, to Delhi, you have to arrange so many things. So what we are doing, that we have to change this body? And there are 8,400,000 different types of bodies. Which body I am going to get? Why we are not serious? We are spoiling our life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span>. That eight million, is that fixed thing, that...? So many life, so many animals species and genera... have become extinct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 8,400,000 species.</div>
<div class="Verse">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati<br class="calibre2"/>kṛmayo rudra-saṅkhyayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>pakṣīṇāṁ daśa-lakṣaṇam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Those that have become extinct, dinosaurs and those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascals' theory. Nothing extinct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> This is not correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like he says that man comes from monkey. Monkey is extinct? Where is the question of extinction? There is no question of extinction. There are different species of life, and according to your <span class="Italic">karma...</span> Just like there are first-class, second-class, third-class compartments. If you pay for the first-class, you enter into first-class. You cannot say that third-class is extinct. According to your <span class="Italic">karma... Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> According to... As you pay. If you pay for third-class, you enter into third-class compartment. If you pay for first-class, you enter into first-class. So it is according to your <span class="Italic">karma</span> you'll get a body. Why it should be extinct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Because it is extinct. We find there are those... fossilized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not find. This is only... You simply repeat Darwin, that's all. You do not find. You do not see anything. You simply hear from Darwin. You have taken Darwin as your authority. But you don't take authority, <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> That is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Darwin had drawn that theory from observations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom he has drawn? He has speculated only, like a rascal. That's all. Wherefrom he got this thing? He has said that "It is my speculation." Speculation is no knowledge. You can speculate in your own way. Knowledge gathered from the authority, that is real knowledge. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] We have published even in Chinese language. European.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> With your comments or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, comments means to explain the original verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> You have explained also in that copy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (8):</span> From where we can get, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get from our temple here. Or from the <span class="Italic">pandal.</span> (end)</div>
