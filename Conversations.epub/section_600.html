<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...theosophist and the theologist, both classes they have no clear idea of God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I think this is... Well, I would say they do not have, they do not... I would make a distinction myself between knowing God and knowing about God. In other words, there is knowledge about God which one has in various books, but one does not know God unless one somehow experiences God. I feel that this is the one thing that the <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> movement of Caitanya has done in that it has allowed its devotees to experience Him, to know Him personally in a way that changes their lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> These materialistic persons, they do not know what is Viṣṇu or they do not know that his ultimate goal of life is to know Viṣṇu, or God. This is human life. But that is missing. They do not care to know that the ultimate, what is the ultimate goal of human life. This is the defect. Nobody cares to know, especially in this age. So that is the defeat of human civilization. They must know. This is the process, that... By evolution, they have come to nature's way, human form of life. Now they must know what is God. Otherwise it is defeat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The opportunity given by nature, good consciousness to know God, Viṣṇu. Now, practically, take anyone, especially in the western world. Nobody can say what is God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> That is quite true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in that position, if we are offering, "Here is God," why do they not accept? What is the objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> There isn't any objection. I think the great problem, of course, in the western world is that the western world has always been involved in materialism and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The western world... That means they don't want to know God. So this is very horrible condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal condition. Not only horrible, it is animal condition. They do not want to know God. Just like these animals, they are not interested. So they have no church, the animals, or temple. But in the human society, either he is Hindu or Muslim or Christian, there is some arrangement for understanding God. Now they are also neglecting that, everyone, all over the world. Now they are clearly... The Communists, they hate to say anything about God. So ultimately they are coming to such position, the Communists, that "No word about God." So this is the position. Now apart from them, just like theologists and theosophists. They are, at least, after understanding what is God, but they cannot ascertain definitely. So why do they not take? We are offering, "Here is God." Where is the objection? Why they should object? If you do not know something and if I give you the information, why you should not take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> That's a good question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my question. [break] Just like in India, for higher technological knowledge, they come to foreign countries. So for knowledge, we can take it from anywhere. There should not be sectarianism, "Oh, why shall I take knowledge from here and there?" Wherever knowledge is available, we should take it. That is the real position of seeker of knowledge. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">nīcād apy uttamā vidyā strī-ratnaṁ duṣkulād api.</span> He says, <span class="Italic">viṣād apy amṛtaṁ grāhyam. Viṣa, viṣa</span> means poison. "In the pot of poison, if there is little nectar in, take it." <span class="Italic">Viṣād apy amṛtaṁ grāhyam.</span> Poison is not to be touched, but if there is little nectar in, take it. And <span class="Italic">amedhyād api kāñcanam:</span> "And in a filthy place there is gold. Take it." Not that gold has been polluted because it is in the filthy place. If there is gold in the filthy place, don't hesitate. Take it. And <span class="Italic">nīcād apy uttamā vidyā.</span> Generally, people used to take education from <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So Cāṇakya Paṇḍita advises that "If there is education, actual education, even he is a lower class man, <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla,</span> take it. Accept him as master." And <span class="Italic">nīcād apy uttamā vidyā. Nīcād apy uttamā vidyā strī-ratnaṁ duṣkulād api.</span> And in India, according to Vedic civilization, the marriage is done after seeing the family tradition very scrutinizingly. So here it is advised that <span class="Italic">duṣkulād api,</span> "In a abominable family, if there is nice girl, educated, beautiful, accept her. Accept her." <span class="Italic">Nīcād apy uttamā vidyā strī-ratnam. Ratnam</span> means jewel. Wife, she is like jewel although born of a low family, accept. So anything very good, even it is available from a place which is not desirable, one should accept it. So if you are actually seeking after God, so here is God available from Vedic literature. Why don't you take it? Why you should refuse it? That is not very good sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> No, that is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we are offering here God. Why should you not take it seriously? I am speaking to you because you have got this Theological... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Union.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Union. So they should take it. If they have no information of actual God, take it from us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes, well, I do, I... As I say, as I said last night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have got that mentality, I know that. But because you are president or chairman of that center... What is that? Union.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I'm chairman of the department of the history and phenomenology of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is the chairman of this union?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I'm just the chairman of this one department of the history and phenomenology of religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's... Then you are also important officer. So you can induce them, that "Here is God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, I'm going to try to do what I can to..., as I told you to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) No, no, if they do not take, refuse to take, so what kind of theologians they are? That is my... Here is the knowledge. Why one should refuse to take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> When you have your temple there in Berkeley, I want to continue on chanting and being with the devotees and doing what I can to further Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> If you take this that "Kṛṣṇa is Indian, Kṛṣṇa is Hindu, we shall not take," but the words Kṛṣṇa, if you take it, "God said," or whatever you..., so the wordings are God's. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "There is nobody, superior element than Me." So God can say that. So you remove the word, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa uvāca,</span> but take the words of God. Who can be superior than God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this way if you read simply <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and separating the word Kṛṣṇa, it is God's word. All factual. So why should you not take the science of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God can say that there is no more greater principle than Me. Is it not? You may accept anyone God, but God can say that. So that is the statement in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat<br class="calibre2"/>kiñcid asti dhanañjaya<br class="calibre2"/>mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.7]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Every word is God's word. You may accept Kṛṣṇa God or not, the words are God's words. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...statements like that in the Bible, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> You'll not find statements like that in the Bible, that "There is no one superior to Me." You don't find those things in the Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> A little indication that there's God, but no real philosophy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...manufacturing so many things, United Nations, World Health Organization, and this philanthropism, but the real thing is wanting that the human life is meant for understanding God, there is no such organization. This is the only organization, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. [break] ...neglectful I do not know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm very happy in my new engagement. I'm finding very much success now. We have made four devotees since I have left, three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very good. [break] ...the definition of God according to the theologicians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, there would be many different definitions of God, I suppose, in Christian theology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> It involves various theologies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no summary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> No. There is no actual statement of any one person or any concept concerning God that would be accepted by all Christians. There are various theologies about God, as I said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, theologists, some of the prominent theologist, what do they say? How they describe God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, it depends upon whether one is a Lutheran or a Calvinist or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let any one of them say something, I want to hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. Well, this is what the professor yesterday was talking about, that there are many different theologies and some people accept one and some accept another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Prabhupāda wants to hear one of them, though. What does the Catholic theology say about God? Thomas Aquinas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, I'm not too good at interpreting the Catholic theology. But they would, the Catholic theology would say that God is the father, that there is the son who was born who is the son of God, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, God has got son. That is all right, but what do you mean by God? Everyone has got son, but that does not mean everyone is God. What is the definition of God? You have got son. I have got son. So God has got son. That does not mean He is God. Everyone has got son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. Well, you see, the Roman Catholics, if we were to consider this then again, would say that the son of God is one with God and the Holy Spirit as the Trinity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And again, the description of the son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes, the three are one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, but who is God? What is the definition of God? Just like king. We can describe, "King means who has got a big kingdom, a large tract of land. He is ruling over it," some description. So what is the definition of God in that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> God is also the creator, they would say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Creator of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then the next question will be that if He is creator, then He has got nice brain. Otherwise how this wonderful creation is there. Everything is going on... Just like this big sea, God is creator; therefore although is a vast water, we are safely standing here because we know God has created in such a way although it is very vast it cannot go, cannot come up to this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how much great brain He has got. He has created in such a way. So we have to understand like that, that "God is creator, so how perfect creator He is." In this way we have to study theology, item by item.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. And God is also, they would say, the judge of man, judging man for his sins, and, of course...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore man is subordinate to God. So why the people are denying the supremacy of God? Just like so-called scientists, rascals, they say, "There is no God." Immediately they should be taken as rascals. Why they should be given this title, "scientist"? He does not know who is his superior. They should be condemned immediately. Anyone who denies God, he is a rascal. He may be scientist, philosopher amongst the fools, but he is a rascal. He does not know his subordinate position. Immediately designate him, "You are rascal. You have no position because you do not know your superior." In this way you have to study. Then these rascals will be caught up, how great rascals they are, denying the existence of God. So we have to teach people like that, that "Don't follow these rascals." That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic">āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who is not God conscious, Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is immediately grouped amongst the miscreants, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ. Kṛti</span> means very meritorious. Just like these scientists. They have got good merit, but that merit is being applied for sinful activities. Just like expert thief, rogue. He has got merit, but he is applying the merit for sinful activities. And next word is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Why they are misusing in this way? Because they are rascal, <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> ass. You have seen yesterday film, the ass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Last night in the movie?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The donkey was carrying that big heavy load.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Oh yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are heavily loaded, and they agree. So these rascals are asses. They are simply heavily loaded, but they do not know why he should agree to bear so much load. That is ass. (laughter) They take great responsibility. You see? So they are asses. The ass does not know, "Why I am taking so much load? And the master will give me little grass. So grass I can get anywhere. Why I agree to take his load?" Therefore this example, ass, is given. He does not know his real interest. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> If you bear some load, you must have some interest in it, but he has no interest, and he is carrying the load. Therefore ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all these social problems, then, in society are basically caused by them denying God. That is the ultimate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because they are asses. Why don't you say like that? (laughter) Because they are big asses and people are following them. That is the misfortune. They are simply bluffing that "We are very great." Just like these scientists, they simply bluffing that "We went to the moon planet. We are doing this, doing that," and taking large salaries, but they are asses. And people are also asses. Therefore they accept, "Oh, he is a big man, cheating us very nicely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, theologians also say that God is the... [break] ...person He is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can describe. [break] Let them take it. If they cannot describe, then take the description from us. We can give. That is knowledge. <span class="Italic">Nīcād apy uttamā vidyā strī-ratnaṁ duṣkulād api.</span> Why they should hesitate, "No, no, why shall I take from him? He is a Hindu." Or "He is a Muslim." What is this? Knowledge has to be taken wherever it is available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> it says that no one has ever seen God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then why don't you go who has seen God? Why remain foolish? That is the Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you do not know, if you have not seen, then go to guru. Why should I sit idle, "I have not seen; I will never see"? Is that knowledge? Go there where you can see. That is intelligence. "Nobody has seen. Therefore there is no use of seeing." What is this argument? This is no argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They also say that no one can ever be pure, that everyone is doomed to be a sinner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is... <span class="Italic">Ātmavat manyate jagat.</span> That is the conditioned soul's qualification that if he is a fool, he thinks other, fools. Everyone, he thinks, "He is like me." That is nature. <span class="Italic">Ātmavat manyate jagat.</span> "Everyone thinks others like himself." If he is a fool, he thinks all are. So these things are no argument. Nobody has seen God? How do you take the statistics? Can you say like that, any statistics, that nobody has... Maybe you have not seen him, one who has seen God. That is quite possible because you have not scrutinizingly studied all the men of the world. Then how you can say, "Nobody has seen"? You have not seen the man who has seen Him. He will not admit his fault. He will accuse others, "Nobody has seen God." Why? You may not have seen, but why you say, "Nobody has seen"? You have not seen that person who has seen God. Therefore you say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So those people who wrote the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> did not see God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... when God is canvassing, "Here I am, Kṛṣṇa," they will not see it. And still, they accuse, "Nobody has seen."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Of course, in Christianity, which many of the Christians, I feel, are not following as closely as they should and have in the past, there is the idea, for example, in the Roman Catholic church, for example, at the time of the Mass, of experiencing the presence of God and there have been Christian mystics who have felt that they have experienced God. For example, St. Theresa, St. John of the Cross, Meister Eckhart, and various ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they must give description of God. If you have seen this rose flower, then you can give a description. If you cannot give a description, then how you have seen rose flower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. Well, they have tried to give descriptions, but, of course, I think all descriptions that have been given of God are, as descriptions are inadequate. Because in my own feeling I believe that the full knowledge of God comes through the actual experience of God, experiencing God in our lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that experience you can get. Just like God is describing Himself. Now, why don't you take that? Your description may be defective because you are imperfect. But if God Himself is giving His, I mean to say, identification, why don't you take it? Not only gives description, He acts according to the description. When Kṛṣṇa was present, He says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> "There is no more superior element." He proved it when He was present. There was no more superior power than Him when Kṛṣṇa was present. In His opulence, in His richness, in His strength, in His education-everything, all topmost, Kṛṣṇa. All topmost. The proof is that because you get the topmost knowledge, therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is read all over the world, accepted, topmost knowledge. All scholars, all philosophers, all religionists, they read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. Well, I, of course, have always felt that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now big, big scholars, they have taken the trouble to write on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. But nobody has taken the trouble to write on other scriptures like Bible or Koran. Nobody has taken. No scholar, no philosopher have tried to comment or study because they know it is not very important. Here is important. This is the proof, wisest. And that is only ABCD of God's knowledge. So people should take advantage. It is accepted indirectly. There are so many editions of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in your country, English. Why they take trouble to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> so carefully? Big, big scholars, philosophers, why? [break] It is the impersonal, cloth. So Śaṅkarācārya has tried to impress this fact, but the rascals followed in a different way. Just like a cloth, big cloth, that is impersonal. Now, you cut it into coat. It becomes like person. So similarly this whole material world is impersonal, but because we have taken a certain portion of it and make my body, it looks like person. And God is not like that. He is spiritual person. He has nothing to do with material. <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> What Śaṅkarācārya impressed, that they are after demigods, so "The demigods, they are not actual person. Real person is Nārāyaṇa." That is Śaṅkarācārya's version. Nārāyaṇa... You will find in his comment on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> First word he writes, <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇaḥ paro 'vyaktād:</span> "Nārāyaṇa has nothing to do with this material world." And he accepts in his comment, <span class="Italic">sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ:</span> "That Nārāyaṇa has appeared as Kṛṣṇa." And he has given specific name of His father as "the son of Devakī and Vasudeva" so that nobody can misidentify. If you have got Śaṅkara's <span class="Italic">bhāṣya,</span> commentary on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you bring it I shall show you. [break] Kṛṣṇa also confirms. That verse, which we were reading last evening... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ jagad avyakta-mūrtinā: [Bg. </span>9.4] "This <span class="Italic">jagat,</span> this material world, is impersonal. And that is My energy. Therefore the whole world is resting upon Me, but I am not there. As person, I am not there." This is the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like the sunshine is spreading all over the universe, but the sun is aloof. Take this example. Not that because the sunshine is here, we are now getting, the sun has come here. The sun is shining from the distant place. He is aloof. Similarly, God is person and His shining is all this creation. That is impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Like the rays of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Śaṅkarācārya's... Not Śaṅkarācārya. His followers have interpreted, "Because God has become all-pervading, then where is God person? He is finished." But they do not see the sun, that although the sun is all-pervading, still, he is maintaining his identity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. That's the <span class="Italic">bhedābheda</span> philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhedābheda</span> philosophy, that is actual philosophy. <span class="Italic">Acintya-bhedābheda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> God is both one and dual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simultaneously. The same example. The sunshine and the sun one, light and heat. But still, the sun is different from the light. [break] ...them about going to the moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> What happened, do you say, to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> To the program of going to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I don't know. But they've stopped it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I don't know. One of the problems has been probably the criticism of the American people that so much money was being spent on going to the moon when there were so many other needs for the money to be used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> With such little result coming from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. The amount, the expense, whether the expense could actually be justified to continue on in the way that they had. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to Venus? They say they are going to Venus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Russians have sent a spaceship to Venus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's unmanned. There are no men in it. They are going to Venus but there is no man in the ship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, why they are going to Venus? They have failed to achieve anything by going to the moon. Now why another attempt, to go to the Venus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, the usual explanation that they have given, as I recall, is that these explorations give man more of a knowledge about how the world was created, our universe was created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Why do they have to go to Venus, though, to figure that out? They have a planet here they can't get any information out of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they are anxious to know how the world was created? It is already created. What is your credit? [break] ...and simply bluffing people, that's all. [break] It is already there. The nice creation is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Accept it as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> And be joyful. But they want to try to imitate the creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. "Where angels dare not, foolish rush in. Where angels dare not, fools rush in." So big, big, giant, saintly persons, they simply admired, and they are going to understand it. What is that? And they can create, like that? They cannot create even an ant, a small ant, and they are going to create, imitate the creation of God. Just see. And we have to believe such fools. (laughter) This is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, because the Christian theologians do not have very much information about God, they are being very much influenced by these scientists and their conceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> The same example. A lion is accepted as the king. He is considered to be the king of the beasts in the forest. And he is very much praised. But a human being will see that the lion is also an animal and those who are praising him, they are also animals. Is it not? So if some animals praises another animal, does it mean that the animal is very big? It may be very big for these animals, but lion is not very big thing to the human being. They can capture it. It is nothing. Actually, they capture and keep it in the zoo. So for a human being both the big animal and a small animal, they are animals, although the small animals praise the big animal. Do you follow what I said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here a big animal is being praised by a small animal, but both of them are animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So in other words the big leaders and the scientists, they are thinking that "When I am president or when I am scientist-then this time we have landed on Venus-I will be praised."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but who will praise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> By other animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By other animals. Not a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Right. But they're thinking, "I will become great," even though we know they are not great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how they will know? He is animal. How he can know his position? And especially when the other small animals praise him he thinks that "I have become very big."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So that is their real motivation for going to Venus. But it isn't very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, "The small animals will praise." That is good policy. I think we shall now go this way. Time is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Twenty to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> everything has been described.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes, I received the first part of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that you translated and sent to me, for which I again thank you. I brought it with me to read on the plane. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...true that now theologians are trying to make mathematical models to understand God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Mathematical models?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> This Whitehead, that Alfred North Whitehead, in process theology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Well, I don't know that that would quite be true. I don't know Whitehead really. But it is a... I don't know whether that could be said to be true or not. I really don't know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...that Altheiser spoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That God is, that slogan, "God is dead," that was started by a Christian theologian, Altheiser.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes, that philosophy of Altheiser's, and Hamilton and some of the others, so-called "death of God theology," of course, was a phase through which Christianity went through but I think has lost its, certainly, its efficacy at the present time. I think it's probably had an effect certainly on some, but I would not say that is characteristic of Christian theology today. In fact, I see a swinging back to a more conservative position. And, of course, as far as the people are concerned, there is this need for an experiential relationship with God, which has gone through all of the churches and which is called the charismatic renewal, and this has been very influential in many of the churches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> But he was trying to say that because God is dead, now we have to revive our relationship with Christ. And then he equated that that everyone is, that means we have to have a relationship with all the human beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. It is put on a, certainly, on a more humanistic scheme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> And now people want to know Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Did they actually seriously think that the Father was dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...dead, then what kind of God he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yeah. He wouldn't be any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the God dies and ordinary animal also dies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yes, it was what they called "atheistic Christianity." (laughter) But as I say, I do not feel that this is representative of Christianity today. And I think that the very fact that this "death of God theology" did become so popular at one particular period is one of the particular reasons why more people have wanted, then have rejected this and have wanted to find some experience of God, find it in their lives to prove, as it were, that He does exist. I think this has been certainly one of the instruments that has caused people to try to seek the reality of God in various ways. In Sufism, I know, in Berkeley they're seeking God, and in the Vedānta and in many other of the different movements, some of them from India and some of them from Japan, particularly in the case of Zen Buddhism which has become very popular. And then, of course, there's always the Sokagaktii(?) in the Bay area which also is very influential among many of the university students, and which, of course, does chanting also. It's a form of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> in Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, nobody has got clear idea of God. This is the difficulty. Nobody knows. We can challenge them. Nobody knows what is God. We can challenge. [break] (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> ...o'clock this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone rises at three o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> I had an interesting dream last night, and after dreaming it, I woke up and stayed awake until I got up, until I was called at five. The dream was... It seems to be a mixture of the events that occurred last night. I was in a temple and doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> with a number of devotees, and in the middle of the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> a little child crawled in on the floor into the temple, and we all stopped and talked to the little child. And I'm reminded... And I thought, "Now what does this mean?" And I remember then. I was talking with Dharma just before I went to bed, and there was this little child that came in from next door there, and so he, we gave him some <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and so I feel that this all got mixed together in this dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dream means some mixed ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> Yeah. Yes. An interesting mixture of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Prabhupāda gives the example that during the day you may see gold and you may see a mountain. So at night you dream of a golden mountain. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> August '66. You are one of the very earliest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, I began this movement from July '66. I came in '65 but I could not do anything. I was loitering here and there. Actually, I began my preaching work from '66, June, July, I think, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> You must have been one of the hippies he converted there in Tompkins Park then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, I wasn't quite a hippie. (laughter) There weren't hippies at that time. It was just beginning. So I had been to the university. I graduated NYU. But I'd been to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Judah:</span> You had been to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. I was planning on going back also. I wanted to take a further degree. I was applying for a Fulbright.</div>
