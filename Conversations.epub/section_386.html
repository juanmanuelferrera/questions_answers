<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane [SB 9.4.18].</span> This is... Different parts of our senses should be utilized. The first business is to fix up the mind at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Then engage the tongue in describing the activities of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has acted in so many ways so that we can remember the history of the activities of Kṛṣṇa and discuss it. <span class="Italic">Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</span> Then the legs should be used for going to the temple. Hands should be used for cleansing the temple. Nose should be used for smelling the flowers offered to Kṛṣṇa. Ears should be used for hearing about Kṛṣṇa. In this way if we engage our senses in different activities relating to Kṛṣṇa, that is success of life. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">Vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</span> (Hindi) So now you can talk. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) [break] Practical purposes. This land and that water is matter, but we are walking on the land. Can you walk on the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who is walking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? You are walking, I am walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> God is walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So so long you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Body is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in the body, so we have to behave duality. (laughter) You cannot say oneness. When you are liberated from the body, that is another thing. For practical purposes... This philosophy was discussed by the mother of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He was a child, this philosophy. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was given very nice sweetmeats to eat. So instead of eating the sweetmeat, He was eating the dirt. So mother said, "My dear child, why You are eating dirt? I have given You <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span>" "Mother, what is the difference between this dirt and <span class="Italic">sandeśa?</span> It is all Brahman." You see? So His mother said, "My dear child, You are all right. Just like this is earth, and there is earthen pot. So if you want to keep water, you cannot throw the water on the ground. You have to take the earthen pot." So this philosophy of oneness and difference was already discussed when Caitanya Mahāprabhu was a child. Simultaneously one and different. Yes. Earthen pot and earth, actually, from the material point of view, they're the same thing. But if you want to keep water you cannot keep it on the ground. You have to take to the jug.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I promise you I won't. Because you are trying to choke me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not... We should have discussion. That is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall we?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Under your command?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All right. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means...?</div>

Just like these boys and girls, my students, they are working under my direction. They are individuals, I am also individual. And they have got their independence, to obey or not to obey, but still, they are directed under my supervision. Similarly, this material nature has got individual power. <span class="Italic">Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> But still, <span class="Italic">yasya icchānurūpam api ceṣṭate sā.</span> That material nature is working under the direction of the Supreme Person.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We call him Baby. He is innocent like a baby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is very good qualification. But sometimes babies are misled. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yena sarvam idaṁ tatam. Yena,</span> that is person. <span class="Italic">Yena.</span> That is not imperson. That is person. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have to say yes before you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You are a Sanskrit scholar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am not. I have just very little Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Yena,</span> this word means person. <span class="Italic">Yena.</span> This is person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Both imperson and person. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ.</span> Now that girl, the doctor lady, you choked the other day in the morning, she, poor thing wanted that "I am practicing the medicine and serving people," and you call her a fool, "You are a damn fool." Well, she's doing the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is not serving. She's serving her... Everyone is serving money, money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṁ vindati...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. This serving, everyone is serving. Unless he pays, no service. That is not service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If we expect payment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu kadācana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here, service, Kṛṣṇa is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) Do you want to throw it up in the sea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is, everyone in this material world, serving somebody. Serving somebody. Because he is servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's serving somebody or everybody. More or less it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No. Everybody or somebody. "Everyone's servant is nobody's servant." That is an English proverb. Anyway, this service is required. You cannot live without serving. That is not possible. Anyone of us, serving somebody. But the result is, this material service... I have given several times the example that Mahatma Gandhi, he gave so much service. But result was he was killed. He was killed. Nobody thought... That person did not think that, "Oh, this gentleman, old man, he has given so much service to us. Suppose I do not agree with him. Oh, how can I kill?" So people are so much ingrateful. You see? That whatever service you may render, they'll never be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That service was <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā,</span> the <span class="Italic">karma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all I am describing the service, what is service. Service means a servant, a master. And the transaction between the master and the servant is called service. Try to understand what is service. So we have created so many masters. The wife master, the family master, the country master, the legislative master, this master, that master. You see? And you are giving service. "Oh, it is my duty. I am giving service." But ask anybody if you are satisfied? He'll say, "What you have done?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He won't be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They'll never be satisfied. <span class="Italic">Kāmādi...</span> But this service is service to my <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, lobha, moha, mātsarya.</span> I am giving service to my wife because she satisfies me by sense gratification. Therefore I'm not giving service to my wife, but I'm giving service to my senses. So ultimately, we are servant of the senses. We are nobody's servants. This is our material position. Yes. Ultimately, we are servant of our senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Or we are the servant of our ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the position is constitutionally I am servant, but at the present moment, being conditioned by the material nature, I am giving service to my senses. Hare Kṛṣṇa. But if I give service to the master of the senses, Hṛṣīkeśa... Because senses, they are not independent. They are also dependent. Suppose I am now moving my hands, but if the master of my hand, Kṛṣṇa, paralyzes it, no more moving. Neither I can renovate the moving capacity of my hand. Therefore I am not master. Although I am claiming I am master of my hand, master of my leg, but actually I am not. The master is different. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is Hṛṣīkeśa, master of the senses. Therefore the service should be transferred. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have engaged our senses for different purposes, but when we engage our senses for the service of the master of the senses, that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> is also service, but it is not service to the senses, but it is service to the master of the senses. This is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So constitutionally I am servant. I cannot become master. I have to serve. So if I don't serve the master of the senses, then I will have to serve the senses. This is our position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was... I wanted a little exposition on this, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā.</span> Now the <span class="Italic">karma</span> of a man... I will speak for the while, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The <span class="Italic">karma</span> of a man depends upon his position in the society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, (etc.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...whether he's a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra</span> whether he's a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> That <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And that <span class="Italic">karma</span> when he does without any expectation of any fruits, that <span class="Italic">karma</span> is as good as <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> according to this line, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Without... The result should be there, but <span class="Italic">tam,</span> unto Kṛṣṇa. Give the result to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya.</span> Not self. You earn lakhs of rupees, but <span class="Italic">tam abhyarcya,</span> give to Kṛṣṇa. Not take it yourself or distribute amongst your children. That is service. <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya. Tam abhyarcya.</span> First of all understand this word, <span class="Italic">tam. Tam abhyarcya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya, karmaṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can you (indistinct) this is a <span class="Italic">karma?</span> That is why I want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā abhyarcya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma, karmaṇā,</span> by your work. Just like you are working as a medical practitioner. So you earn lakhs of rupees. Give to Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">tam abhyarcya.</span> Then you become perfect. That is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhāḥ.</span> We have already explained that our <span class="Italic">karma,</span> according to <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama... Ataḥ pumbhir dvija-śreṣṭhā varṇāśrama-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> Everyone is working according to <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> So <span class="Italic">svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya.</span> Anyone who is serving according to his <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> an engineer, a doctor, or somebody else, according to his occupational duty he is serving. But he has to see, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiṁ labhate.</span> It is <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> And it is said, <span class="Italic">svanuṣṭhitasya dharmasya saṁsiddhiḥ,</span> perfection. What is that? <span class="Italic">Hari-toṣaṇam.</span> We have to see whether Kṛṣṇa is satisfied. So you earn lakhs of rupees and give it to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi,</span> "Never mind what you are doing," <span class="Italic">kuruṣva tad mad arpaṇam,</span> "give Me it." (laughter) And "No, no, no, sir. I'm serving You, but the money is in my pocket."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything is Kṛṣṇa's. How can you give anything? Even a leaf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, yes. Just like these boys and girls are giving. Oh, that is the philosophy. These boys, girls, they are giving everything. Whole life. Whole life. They have no... They do not ask even a single <span class="Italic">payasā</span> from me that "My dear sir, please give me four <span class="Italic">ānās.</span> I'll go to the cinema." You see? They are serving. Everything they have given. This boy, you like this Girirāja. He's earning at least 50,000 per month. Not a single <span class="Italic">payasā,</span> even fifty n.p. he does not keep. This is service. They are not poor. They're earning, but everything for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Girirāja, how you are earning fifty thousand rupees a month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Fifty-thousand. Because fifty members. Fifty members, eleven hundred rupees. He makes at least two, three members. If some day absent, average fifty. Fifty thousand. Not a single fifty n.p. he keeps. There are many. All, all of them. Not that everyone is earning fifty thousand, but even fifty hundred or fifty <span class="Italic">payasā,</span> everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">tam abhyarcya.</span> And if you divide partially, "Some percentage for Kṛṣṇa, some percentage for my sense gratification," then Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Proportionately. If you have spent cent percent of your energy for Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is cent percent for you. And if you have spent one percent for Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is one percent for you. Responsive cooperation. (laughter) Yes. This institution has advanced so much all over the world because we have got these boys who have dedicated everything for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it has so quickly advanced all over the world. They do not think of anything of personal. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya. Saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam [SB 1.2.13].</span> Kṛṣṇa is also... Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is that <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span> noun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhi</span> means perfection. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiḥ paramaṁ gataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span> actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhi</span> means perfect perfection. <span class="Italic">Samyak</span> perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is perfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfection means you are living entity, you are living entity you are rotting in this material world, get free from this material world, go back to home. That is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi.</span> We are suffering so much on account of being in the material world. <span class="Italic">Tri-tāpa-yatana</span> (?), threefold miseries. And everyone is trying to get out of the miseries, but that is not possible in the material world. Therefore you get your spiritual form, and go back to Kṛṣṇa and dance with him. That is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi.</span> "After giving up this body, no more accepting any more material body." Then, he's zero? No. <span class="Italic">Mām eti.</span> "He comes to Me, to dance with Me, to play with Me." That is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi. Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> When Śukadeva Gosvāmī was describing the cowherds boy playing with Kṛṣṇa, he described, <span class="Italic">itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā... </span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">These boys, these cowherds boys, they have accumulated, <span class="Italic">kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ,</span> heaps of pious activities, therefore they are now allowed to play with Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> Not ordinary thing. So the impersonalists, they cannot understand, "What is this, playing with Kṛṣṇa, cowherds boy?" But here it is said, <span class="Italic">kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> This is not ordinary thing. <span class="Italic">Itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā.

And <span class="Italic">māyāśritānāṁ nara-dārakeṇa. Mūḍha. Māyāśritānām.</span> They are thinking, "Oh, He is Kṛṣṇa, ordinary boy. What is this?" But they are playing. These boys are playing with Him. Why? <span class="Italic">Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> Of many lives pious activities, they have come to this position, <span class="Italic">kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ. Māyāśritānāṁ nara-dārakeṇa.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...to understand Kṛṣṇa and to engage himself in the service of the Lord, it requires a qualification, that completely... <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">. Janānāṁ puṇya-ka...</span> Those who are simply... This is the highest <span class="Italic">puṇya-karma,</span> to engage one life's activities only for the service of Kṛṣṇa. That is the greatest <span class="Italic">puṇya-karma.</span> And material <span class="Italic">puṇya-karma,</span> a little discrepancy... Just like Nṛga. Nṛga. What is that? He was very charitable, distributing cows, and little mistake, he had to become an alligator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes, yes. And he fell into that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well.</div>
