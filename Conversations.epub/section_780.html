<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, in the morning, it rises reddish. So why it does not look reddish always if it is fixed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, the material scientists say it's because of the atmospheric condition. It refracts the light in such a way that it becomes reddish. That's what they say. Because it's thicker atmosphere. You have to look through more atmos...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how it comes so high? After few hours it goes so high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, there is less atmosphere to look through. Why it goes up there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means move?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no. Because we're moving this way. The earth is rotating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are moving, but why you say sometimes this position and sometimes that position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because the earth also moves like this. It's going around the sun, and then every day it rotates once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It rotates on an axis like this. So therefore the sun seems to go around, but actually it's the earth that goes around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, if you measure when this sun and when it comes meridian distance, so do you think the earth is moving so quickly? It is... According to their modern science, the earth is moving twenty-five thousand miles only throughout... No, within twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's around the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Then is it possible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Twenty-four-hour day, twenty-five thousand miles circumference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how earth has gone so quickly round that it is seen, the different position of the sun? This means sun is not fixed. Sun is moving. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said that it is moving at the rate of sixteen thousand miles per second. I think I have calculated that. Sixteen thousand miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda? Does that mean that the sun is going around the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Is the sun going around the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is going around the whole planetary system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The scientists think the whole planetary system is going around the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, earth is also moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Earth planet is also moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Along with all other stars. That you can see at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are all moving around the polestar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So that means that the more we learn material education, (we're) just becoming more and more foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Material education means <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> This is also material education, the movement of the sun. But they are not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if the earth is moving so fast, why isn't everything blown off?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Why are we not blown off the surface of this planet? Now it's moving so fast. How are we able to remain here and not be blown off?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The planet is moving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's saying, "We're moving, so therefore the wind should blow everybody off, the speed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Why is everything so peaceful if we're moving so fast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is moving so fast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, Bhavānanda said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Planet, this planet is moving so fast, but it doesn't appear to be moving at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose a small ant is on some big wheel, does it feel anything, movement? A big wheel and a small ant. What he will feel? This is called relativity. Law of relativity. Why you are thinking that relatively you are very big? That is your foolishness. You are nothing, insignificant. Therefore you are surprised when Kṛṣṇa appeared as Varāha-mūrti, to take the whole earth on His nose. Who will say it is mythology? You do not know how great Kṛṣṇa can become. <span class="Italic">Mahato mahīyān. Aṇu...</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṇor aṇī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṇor aṇīyān anusmared yaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyāt.</span> So He is greater than the greatest. Yaśodāmāyī thought that "My child are eating earth? So show." She saw all the planetary system within His mouth. So she thought, "What is this? All right, don't do this." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So to accept a spiritual master means that one has to learn everything again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That to accept a spiritual master means that we have to learn everything over again. Practically everything we learned was incorrect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is correct to some extent but... Just like you can see to some extent, but that does not mean you can see everything. You have got limited potency. This is called unlimited and limited. We are limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually I think it makes much more sense, because when the scientists say that the earth spins around this way very quickly, then his point is valid. Why we don't fall off or why we don't feel good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not quickly. It is only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But when the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says the whole thing moves, then there is no friction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Therefore it is still. It's not rubbing against everything because everything is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like this earth also. According to them it is going around the sun. But we don't feel anything. According to them. And according to..., it is running at the rate of twenty-five thousand miles, and if you, in airplane, it is going six hundred miles per hour, and still there is so many jerking. That is your creation, tiny machine. And God's creation, it is moving. Even it is moving, you cannot understand. That is perfect creation. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam.</span> The word is <span class="Italic">pūrṇam idam,</span> everything perfect. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because God is all-perfect, whatever He has created, they are all-perfect, relatively, all perfect. Just like this earth. It is all-perfect. Whatever you want, you inhabitants of this earth, they are all there. You want air, water, light? Everything is there. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idam. Pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate, pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya.</span> So you are using so much water, so much light; still, it is perfect. Just like the cultivation. Every year you are taking so much production. Still, again you can take. This is <span class="Italic">pūrṇam idam,</span> perfectly done. That is God's creation. This is body, you see. You have to capture something. You require some solid thing here. It is there. If it is..., it was soft, only skin, then you could not catch this. How perfectly it is done. It is required here, not the whole finger. This is called perfect creation. The sensation of sex is in a particular position, not everywhere, because if that sensation were not there, then nobody would feel sex, and there would be no creation. This is called perfect creation. The same sensation could have been here, there. No. That particular sensation is there to induce him. Similarly, everything is going on. How to fix it? Every body is made... Every body is made according to the work it has to do. You see? The pig, it has to eat stool. His mouth is made in a different way. The tiger has to eat meat; his mouth is made differently. This is called perfect creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And also among human beings, different human bodies are made differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. According to... <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> So according to the <span class="Italic">guṇa</span> he's infecting, the body is made. If you infect some disease, smallpox, then you must get the disease. There is no excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So a devotee... It is said in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that a devotee is above the modes of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It is said in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So when a devotee becomes very advanced, does that means that he should not feel a particular, an inclination to do a particular work but simply want to serve Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise how they can give up sex life? Unless he is liberated, how he can give up sex life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's something which puzzles all the materialists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mater... They are rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Their only title is "<span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span>" ass. Viśvanātha Cakravartī has described the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> as <span class="Italic">mūḍhas. Karmīs</span> are lowest grade of <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> And above them the <span class="Italic">jñānīs.</span> And above them, <span class="Italic">muktas,</span> liberated. And above them, <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> And above all <span class="Italic">bhaktas, kṛṣṇa-bhakta.</span> This is the graduation. So <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are all <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> There are other kinds of <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> other than <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhaktas</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. <span class="Italic">Nārāyaṇa-bhakta, viṣṇu-bhakta.</span> They are all Kṛṣṇa, but above all of them is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Many people in India, they say they are <span class="Italic">śiva-bhaktas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all in the material world, <span class="Italic">karmīs. Karma-kāṇḍa,</span> ritualistic ceremonies. Prahlāda Mahārāja has described them. What is that very word used? And meaning is "one who cannot control their senses." <span class="Italic">Avijita-indriya. Ajitendriyāṇām, ajita,</span> "one who could not conquer the senses," they are called <span class="Italic">karmīs. Ajitendriyāṇām.</span> So all these penances, silence, meditation, then studying the Vedic literature, and so many things are there. Prahlāda Mahārāja, in one word he says, "They are meant for <span class="Italic">ajitendriyāṇām,</span> one who could not conquer over the senses, for them." And for a devotee, one who is actually pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he is <span class="Italic">sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not that a tiny devotee can claim that he has overcome the influence of this world. No. This is called <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not that because you have taken to devotional..., you have become immediately. The process has begun immediately, curing process. But we should not think that we have become perfect. That is wrong. <span class="Italic">Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyam.</span> Therefore you must follow the regulative principles. As soon as you become a rascal-"Now I have become advanced. I don't require to chant sixteen rounds. I can do whatever I like"-then he has gone to hell. Upstart, immediately he becomes <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> He's a rascal. He was given the path of becoming <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> One is admitted in the school, he must learn, and one day he will become M.A. But simply by entering in the school, if he says, "I am M.A.," that is rascaldom. This is a chance. To become <span class="Italic">jitendriya</span> is very difficult task. But it is easy if he immediately becomes a pure devotee. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūṇyam: [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11] "Everything make zero, all desire, except Kṛṣṇa consciousness." That is wanted. But that does not become very easily done. One has to try very rigidly; then he'll be <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Therefore amongst the devotees, there are three grades: <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī, madhyama-adhikārī,</span> and <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī.</span> So if the <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> thinks that "I have become <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī,</span>" then he's a rascal. He's a rascal. If he wants to imitate the <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī,</span> then he's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Is that cheating propensity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not cheating. Foolishness. It may not be cheating, but he does not know. <span class="Italic">Arcāyām eva haraye pūjāṁ yat śraddhayehate...</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Na tad-bhakteṣu cānyeṣu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa bhaktaḥ prākṛtaḥ smṛtaḥ.</span> The beginning is <span class="Italic">arcā, arcana.</span> And because he was given the chance of <span class="Italic">arcana,</span> if he thinks that "I become <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa,</span>" then he's a foolish. It will take time. The process is there. Therefore preaching is <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī.</span> One should take to preaching work gradually. When the preaching... Preachers, they have got discrimination, "Here is <span class="Italic">abhakta</span>; here is <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span>" But in the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> stage, <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī,</span> he sees "Everyone is devotee. I am not devotee." That is <span class="Italic">uttama-adhikārī.</span> Just like Kavirāja Gosvāmī said, <span class="Italic">purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha [</span><i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Ādi 5.205]<span class="Italic">.</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī said that "I am born in low-grade family. My work is low grade." [break] ...issued that complaint? "I am the counterpart."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāstrījī:</span> Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The laborers have not come yet? [break] ...<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> verse? <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca?</span> What is the full <span class="Italic">śloka</span>? <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span> That this flavor of the rose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Original fragrance of the earth"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Out of that, most fragrant flavor, Kṛṣṇa says, "I am directly that." So if you are Kṛṣṇa conscious, having this flavor, he'll understand, "Here is Kṛṣṇa." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span> This flavor is there all over this earth, but you cannot see it. That does not mean there is no God. But He is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> It would be easier for them if they didn't live in the cities, because the cities make it so hard for anybody to understand there is a God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, understanding... Therefore they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> They have to understand. If they do not understand, they remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> That is human life. The human being should understand that "I am <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> so I'll have to learn." And the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says, "Then go to guru." <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "You must go if you want to learn." And if he remains <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> and speculates, then he remains <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> He never gets the enlightenment. He remains continually... <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā janmani janmani mām aprāpyaiva</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> He cannot get God. Life after life, he will go on like that, <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Asuriṣu-yoni. Asurika-yoni.</span> He'll remain completely ignorant about God, what was his function, only function to understand God during this life of human form of life. And so-called science wants to keep him rascal and <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> that's all. Therefore we fight so much with these rascals, big rascals. They want to keep them. He is <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> he is blind, and he's trying to lead other blind men. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Rascal does not know that he is hand and bound..., hand and leg, bound up by the laws of material; still he denies, that "I am independent. I can think independently. I can avoid God," and so many things. Therefore they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> He cannot do it. In every inch he is bound up, and still he is thinking, "independent." That is the first-class <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Every... Dark, darkness. He keeps himself in darkness. This life was given to him by nature to become liberated by understanding God, but he does not take care of. He is making plan: "We shall be happy like this. We shall be happy like this. We shall be happy like this." Therefore they are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> That will not help him. He does not know that. And if he simply tries to understand Kṛṣṇa, he becomes immediately liberated. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti.. [Bg. </span>4.9].<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. But he will do so many plans, and nothing will be successful. He'll avoid Kṛṣṇa. This is the first-class <span class="Italic">mūḍha. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> the Vedānta philosophy's first instruction: "Now you inquire about God. This is the only chance. As cats and dogs you cannot do that. Now, <span class="Italic">atha, ataḥ.</span> You have enjoyed your senses so much as cats, dogs, tigers, so on, so on. Now you devote to understand, inquiry." <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span></div>
