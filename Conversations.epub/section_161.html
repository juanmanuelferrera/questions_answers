<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vivekananda has influence here in higher class, among the educated class. They talk about Vivekananda and this and that, nonsense. In your country, fortunately, that opposition was not there. There was no influence of Vivekananda class men. Here amongst the educated class there is influence of all these rascals, Vivekananda, Aurobindo, and... That is one defect. But in the mass there is no influence. In the class, educated class. Because educated class means wine, women, meat, and Vivekananda allows this. That is the point. Vivekananda has no distinction of eating. "Eat any... All Brahman, all Nārāyaṇa. You are Nārāyaṇa. Goat is Nārāyaṇa. So Nārāyaṇa is going in the belly of Nārāyaṇa. What is the wrong? One Nārāyaṇa is going, being absorbed by another Nārāyaṇa." But he is not agreeable to be eaten by a tiger, another tiger Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They actually say that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "One Nārāyaṇa is being absorbed by another."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One respectable pleader in Allahabad, I said, "Why you are eating this?" We also find that he's a very religious man. So I inquired. He was just like our father; still, I inquired. He said, "No, what is the wrong there? Nārāyaṇa, Brahman. So one Brahman is going into the belly of another Brahman, Brahman being absorbed, <span class="Italic">brahmeti."</span> So they have got so dangerous theory. But still, we shall not hesitate to kick on their face but because they are making a propaganda, it should be peaceful. But I become very much agitated with this nonsense because I know they are creating havoc. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Come on. (door closes) So many rascals. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So yesterday we went to that place, that swami with the silver glasses and black beard that always gives his respect to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, he has become head swami of this temple, very big, very nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Hodgepodge but very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Yes. A big marble statue of Buddha, very costly, and tiles from Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tiles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This temple is made by one American.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> By an American?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I was told it was built by one American. I don't know who.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not give us that place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't think he's prepared to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have residential quarters? They have made some residential quarter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I didn't see any residential quarter. Mostly temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very big temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's one big temple with different rooms. Very large, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better than this <span class="Italic">Gītā Bhavan?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, I don't think it's better than <span class="Italic">Gītā Bhavan.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was simply attempted, not finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Not finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... Oh, thank you. Why not spread those blankets? Then you can... They are being used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There is a blanket in your room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blanket or mattress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They have blankets in their rooms. They left them in their rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring mattress and spread. (Hindi) Sit down. This is comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In God's temple, what human wants? And what type of life he wants so that he can be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not upon that. You spread separately. You have no bed sheet? Bed sheet you can spread. The human demand is happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Happiness, yes. But happiness means increase in which is already happy. It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, the thing is, what is that happiness? That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21] "The absolute happiness or the perpetual happiness or the greatest happiness is that which is enjoyed by supernatural senses."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Would that be by all the senses-mind, intelligence...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything but in their supernatural, not in this condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not in this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You see, otherwise it is said that when a person is happy with the self, happy with others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. Try to understand. He has got his senses. These senses are now covered with the coating of material conception of life. Therefore this sense pleasure is not complete or perfect. Just like everyone has got... Now, you have got your tongue. Now, the tongue, when it is coated you cannot taste the things. So the coating is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I was, missing me was in this degree, that just like here, people, why we are, we got the news in our senses, our mind sees or perceives...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are living, symptoms of living condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Living condition. So, but we are not affected by air, which is most required and most special for our use. Because it is abundant, and it will be given to every person at all the times, in all circumstances, therefore we do not keep it under lock and key. Western countries, though they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There is no question of Western-Eastern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I was speaking of materialism and spiritualism. I was talking on that point, that though we see, I mean, I don't say have made it, but yet because there is no what kind of life they want, or in our Eastern countries, because they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If you study the whole thing in that way-Western-Eastern... There is no question of Western-Eastern. It is the question of the living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, how to live in such a way where there is no dearth of thing as well as there is no continuing of that need that a man becomes lost? That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is the point. And for that, what kind of spiritual should we lead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That I am going to explain, that... That is one line: <span class="Italic">sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriya-grāhyam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">sukham ātyantikaṁ</span> is being searched both by the Western, Eastern, everyone, even cats, dogs, everyone. But the cats and dogs, animals, they cannot adjust what is that <span class="Italic">ātyantikaṁ sukham.</span> But human being can. So human being, there is no question of Eastern and Western. It is a question of degree only. But actually everyone is searching after that perpetual happiness. So it is a problem for everyone, and that problem can be solved by Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> By?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the..., I mean to say, a rough scheme, rough estimation. Now, how Kṛṣṇa consciousness can solve this problem, that is a detailed thing. But this is a fact. It is not the question of Eastern-Western. It is the problem of all living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, living entities. Human, actually we have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not even human life, even animal life. There are 8,400,000s of different kinds of bodies. So this is a problem for everyone. Now in other species of life than the human form, they cannot solve. They have no power. But a human being can solve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, they have got understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And that solution is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What do you mean by that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a detailed question, "How it can be?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but are we satisfied with the past...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will be never satisfied without Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I mean was it really or were we at that time...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which time? What do you mean "that time"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That time means at the time of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Were we completely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the time of Kṛṣṇa... You are taking simply the portion of the time when Kṛṣṇa was present. You are saying about that. But Kṛṣṇa is present always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, but if you say that, in that way, then he gets because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, raso 'ham apsu kaunteya: [Bg. </span>7.8] "I am the taste in the water." Now, this taste in the water is perpetual. When Kṛṣṇa was physically present or Kṛṣṇa is not physically present, this is a perpetual fact. Is it not? Do you think the taste in the water was different when Kṛṣṇa was present and the taste of water is different now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, it cannot be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, He says, <span class="Italic">prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:</span> "I am the shining of the sun and the moon." In this way, if you study what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then you'll find that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only solution for that highest perfectional stage of happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We are giving names; therefore we become confused because in our God incarnation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If there is name why you be confused? If your name is Mr. such and such but you do not know the name, that is the confusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because so many names have been given to these same things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said, "There are so many names of God. Out of all of them, Kṛṣṇa is the principal." God's name is given... Just like Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Vasudeva; therefore He is called Vāsudeva. Kṛṣṇa played in Vṛndāvana as the son of Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodā; therefore He is called Yaśodā-nandana. Kṛṣṇa acted as the driver, chariot driver Arjuna. Therefore He is known as <span class="Italic">Pārtha-sārathī.</span> So His name... All these names are according to His different activities. So He has got unlimited activities, and therefore He has got unlimited names. So out of all these names, Kṛṣṇa is the supreme or the prime because Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. So God, if God is not all-attractive, He cannot be God. So one God is attractive for me, another God is attractive for... He is not supreme God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Reason we take the name of the God or anything is to achieve the supreme happiness or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That supreme happiness is different thing. We are talking of God's name. First of all let us understand that God's name, we have different God's name according to God's activities. Madhusūdana. Because He killed the demon Madhu, therefore His name is Madhusūdana. Mādhava. Because He is the husband of goddess of fortune-Ma means goddess of fortune-therefore He is Mādhava. All the names you analyze. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is also the name of God because He is all-attractive. Now, how you can deny that God is not all-attractive? Is it possible? God is all-attractive. Can you deny this fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, there is no denying, you see, because we only know that all-attractiveness in Śyāmasundaram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śyāmasundaram... But the Śyāmasundaram means He is blackish, still, He is so beautiful that thousands of Cupids cannot be compared with Him. <span class="Italic">Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">. Kandarpa-koṭi.</span> Cupid is supposed to be the most beautiful, but about Kṛṣṇa it is stated that:</div>
<div class="Verse">veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam<br class="calibre2"/>kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.30]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Veṇuṁ kvaṇantam: He is playing on flute. <span class="Italic">Aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ:</span> His eyes are just like petals of the lotus flower. <span class="Italic">Barhāvataṁsam:</span> He has got a peacock feather on His head. <span class="Italic">Asitāmbuda:</span> and His color is just like black cloud. <span class="Italic">Sundarāṅgam:</span> but His beauty, total beauty is <span class="Italic">kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Still, the beauty... As soon as we say blackish, we think that he... If somebody is blackish, he is not beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is also charm in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But still, He's still charming. Because it is all transcendental, we cannot compare the blackish cloud. It is simply given, an idea, that it is like blackish cloud. But immediately it is said, still, <span class="Italic">kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> So God has many names, and according to your conception, you can have God's name also. But out of all those names, many thousands and unlimited different types of names, Kṛṣṇa is the principal name because Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. You cannot say that God is not all-attractive. And if you use that sense, all-attractive, this is the word, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I was... You see, I was trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the difficulty is don't try to invent something about God. That is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, not invention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to take the version of the <span class="Italic">śāstras;</span> then it will be possible. If you invent something, try to speculate on something, it will not be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'm not, you see... In the middle, I may be speculating or you see, trying to... Coming to the human aspect itself, now so many want happiness. Happiness is checked up because of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That material coating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Material things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, we want... Because this want is there... Want is made by own nature and there is no way throughout our... Now when we earning means there's so much contami..., mean, sea of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I am just coming to that. I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, one point is that earning or begging-beg, borrow or steal-that is not happiness. Because to acquire a standard of happiness you have to beg, you have to earn, or you have to steal, so that is not happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. What I am saying is that as long as a man lives...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are not talking of "as long as man lives." He lives eternally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, it is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And it is eternal bondage there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Bondage for so long you are in this material bondage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In some form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you have to understand in the spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, even there is spiritual form, one has to live in certain form, without which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural form. That is not a conventional form. Just like you have dressed yourself with black coat. It is not your natural form. So material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Has spirit no want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, no want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Without it, you see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything you desire, it is present immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You mean the spirit has got subtle form, though it may be exact form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Though mind has got no form outside but mind has a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The spirit, he has a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Intelligence is also accepting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are different coating. Just like you have got your form, therefore your coat has got a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I was thinking in this form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't think like that way. First of all you try to understand. Because you have got a form, your coat has got a form. You try to understand this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, water, though may not have form, but it has got form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why may not? You try to understand practically. You have got a form, therefore your shirt has got a form, your coat has got a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That spirit has this form, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So because originally you have got hand, your coat has got hand. Because originally you have got hand, your shirt has got hand. Therefore this form, the material form which you are seeing, it is coating only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Material form of what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, me, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, "me" means what? A spirit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is what I say. Any spirit will have certain form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not certain form. He has got his original form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Original means all the... We are living from the eternal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Eternally you have got a form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> From the eternal we have got certain form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material. Past certain form, that is material. But you have got an original spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Spiritual form is there but due to the bond man has taken this form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This form is being developed according to your mental condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Mental conditions are due to want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Subtle form, subtle form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Those are again due to want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Due to want? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> All these forms are due to want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Want. That want because you are in the material condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Every person in a material... Spirit in matter remains because both are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, as we have got a material form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit has got no material form. Spirit has got spiritual form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Spiritual form but yet also it has got a material form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he has come... Just like you have accepted this kind of coat. I have got a different kind of coat. She has got a different kind of coat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. According to that there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So as I liked, so I have got shirt and coat. This is material. But originally, spiritual form is the same as you have got, I have got, she has got a form, everyone. That is original form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, our question... (indistinct) We try. Now, question of earning also, the definition is not here, being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The question of earning comes so long you have got this material form. But from the spiritual form there is no question of earning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In what way we will live in that spiritual form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to know. That you have to know. <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> That spiritual form means complete blissfulness, complete knowledge, and eternity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Turiya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Turiya,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In that <span class="Italic">turiya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">turiya</span> life, complete blissfulness, complete knowledge, and eternity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You see, because it is a creation of the world... (indistinct) And that means that matter is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Matter is always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ah. We want to live and enjoy, therefore this universe and all these things. Now, in what perfect form? Because everywhere, in everything, there is a best. Now how everything should take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The universal form should come to the best. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't talk of universal form. First of all talk of your form. Try to understand your form. Then go universal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Am I separate from matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not separate. Are you not separate? Then why you are talking with me? Are you not separate with me? Why you have come to inquire from me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, because we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all try to... Are you not separate from me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In material way, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any way. Any way, are you not separate from me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, every drop is separate from one another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Every individual person is separate from one another, every individual person. So how do you say they are one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Every individual is separate, but when we come in the <span class="Italic">prema...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then every person, until it is the best...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...is just an object of...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is possible. Even... Don't think that when that stage will come there will be no individuality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Individuality will be there. I do not say that it will not be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I was saying was particular individual in a particular way. Therefore the shape of world is in today is off. But if every individual takes the destined way, which is good enough for every person, then all things can change at once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, why do you way that thinking will be stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I do not say, sir. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then you say who will think? Thinking will be there, individuality will be there, but there will be no disagreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Individuality will be there for the self as well as for all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is what I mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now, how that kind of living or what kind of religion is that, on that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to learn from the authorized Vedic literature. You cannot imagine. You cannot speculate. You have to learn from authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Authority...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suppose if you want to go to Germany. Now you have no idea how the German people live or their, how they are, what is their culture. So you have to learn. Here is a boy, German. You have to learn from him what kind of life there is. Similarly, there is a life like that. Now, what kind of life that is, we have to ask from a person who has realized that life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are two things. I am still, I'm still... that we are raised upon this material life (indistinct) that may be available just like air. Air we do not keep the air under lock and key. There is no dearth of time, no dearth of energy, no dearth of resources. Only dearth is that we have no clear perspective (indistinct) we are under control. (indistinct) in the only because of our other and therefore we have become confused. So from Buddha's time we wanted there should be no sickness, old age, and death, etc. But it is continuing. There is no such country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how do you respect these words of Lord Buddha, first thing is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I have got one thing, you see, that it is through the diffusion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Lord Buddha, we have to accept him as an authority, Lord Buddha. Now, he gives you idea that no misery. So how do you accept these words of Lord Buddha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I do not because that was not..., has not come into...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means he was giving that hint in spiritual life, not in this life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. So I wondered that if we can create, when we are free from this and we do not fight on the air. We fight on the things which are scarce. And why there is a scarcity? Because we are not (indistinct) people. Therefore there is a scarcity. If we think on that point and all this is clear, then, when there is no want of life of a material even, then only, every person rises himself from this material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing is... May I ask your name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Bateriya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Batel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Bateriya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bateriya. You belong to this province?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I came from Sindh, Karachi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Bateriya. So Mr. Bateriya, this process, this transcendental knowledge, super, superhuman knowledge, you cannot think first of all. You cannot think. You have to learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> To realize all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Realize after learning from the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because you see, this question I have asked from 1939... There was a little problem in Karachi. I was very fond of my father. He died when I was only ten. I thought on, "What is this?" and all these things. "Why we are, humanity is suffering all these things?" It was this question in my mind and what other, I thought of these problems. This appeared as invisible, you see, and material, but to me, inside, it is, you see, a teaching because it was not taught for any individual or for any kind of... It is taught for all men beyond the world so that we can bring that kind of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are thinking from your side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not from my..., as a particular person but as of the, our own humanity, as a spiritualist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The spiritual knowledge is called <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge, <span class="Italic">tat, oṁ tat sat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Oṁ tat sat. Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Oṁ tat sat.</span> So the <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tad-viddhi. Tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. Praṇipātena.</span> You understand <span class="Italic">praṇipāta?</span> Surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">tad viddhi.</span> If you want to understand that transcendental knowledge, then you have to accept this process, <span class="Italic">praṇipāta. Praṇipāta</span> means surrender, and surrender means there must be somebody to whom you surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Whom you surrender, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two, not alone. So you cannot alone think of <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge. You have to surrender to somebody. That is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are eight kinds of getting the knowledge, means <span class="Italic">bhakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is a process. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not knowledge. That knowledge you acquire by your sense perception, and <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the pure activities of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, surrender means <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> One surrenders to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No question of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is the process. If you want to know about <span class="Italic">tat,</span> then that is the process. You have to surrender. So long you will think that "I can think of, I have got power," you'll be failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That consideration of "myself, I am thinking," that is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who is thinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Thinking means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, don't use abstract knowledge. As soon as you are thinking, you are thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that sometimes thinking, when you are listening inside you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, listening or thinking, these are different process of acquiring knowledge, but you are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, my outer form is doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But inner form may be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that inner form? You are inner form. Your outer, your coat, is not thinking. Your shirt is not thinking. What you mean by outward, inward? Inward you are. Outward your coat and shirt. Do you think your coat and shirt is thinking? You are thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, I am thinking, but, you see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "but." You are thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I am thinking. One is at the lower level, and one is at the higher...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Either in the lower level or in the higher level, you are thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore, because you are thinking in the lower level, therefore your thinking is imperfect. So to be in higher level, you have to surrender to a higher personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Higher wouldn't be better than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like child is thinking something. His thinking is lower level. But when he inquires from his father, that is higher level. The same thinking is he, but one stage his thinking is lower level; in another stage his thinking is higher level. But thinking always, he.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, thinking is his always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge is higher level, and therefore you have to accept that <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge from a higher level personality, not from by yourself, because you are in the lower level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, how do we know lower level and higher level?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you do not know, therefore you... Why you are thinking? Because you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, it is not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no question of asking me. Then you think yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, we were trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you try to understand the principle. Why you have come to ask me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not ask but just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are thinking on the lower level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, to configure over it, not to ask or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why configure? Configure does not mean that you have thought something in lower level; I have to confirm that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not even that. We have all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, if you are thinking right, if you are thinking on the higher level, there is no question of coming to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There is no question of coming or going. Just it was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, inquiry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, spiritual endeavor. There is no use in that. It may be in lower level or higher level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There is. There is. There is. Higher level, lower level, there is, as soon as there is thinking, feeling, and willing. These are the activities of the mind, and there is higher level, lower level, etc...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In that we are missing the main twist out of whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So main twist... But main you are not missing. The point is that if you continue to think on the lower level, then how you can reach to the higher level?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is the distinction between higher and lower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know? A child is thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, let us think of what is the highest thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to learn from the highest man. Yes. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that <span class="Italic">tad viddhi:</span> "You understand that transcendental knowledge by surrender." So if you do not surrender, there is no possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But I might have surrendered myself to my own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. You are thinking lower level, and how you can surrender to yourself? Then how you can get advance? Your surrender means to a superior person, as soon as you call surrender. And without this, there is no possibility.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">We have to accept these principles; otherwise how it can make the... There is no possibility. Just like if you want to be educated. You have to be admitted to an institution, in school, in a college. If you say, "I shall be educated at home," that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Many have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No "many." This is the general process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, general process sometimes have failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why fail? The schools are going on. Colleges are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Therefore they are fearing also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, they are not closed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Closed... Today they are coming to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another theory. But the process is, our Vedic process, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārtham sa gurum eva abhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "In order to understand <span class="Italic">tat</span> knowledge one must approach a spiritual master." <span class="Italic">Gacchet.</span> If you don't accept these principles, then how you can make progress? <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsur śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you don't accept this principle, there is no possibility. Then you can go on thinking in your own way. There is no question of going to anyone. You make yourself perfect by thinking, as many others are doing, speculating. That is possible but never to the perfectional point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Perfectly, you see... What is the category of different perfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to learn. That you have to learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, learn from whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the higher authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So how we know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, who is higher authority. That you have to search out. That you have to search out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We must understand what is higher person and what is lower and whether Buddha is correct or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, higher authority... Suppose we accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority. Our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is accepting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, we accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority. Do you accept that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I mean, I am shown the form. You see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of shown. Kṛṣṇa is accepted higher authority not only by us by big <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> like Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, those who are guiding our Vedic life in India, Caitanya. So Kṛṣṇa is accepted the highest authority. [break] Kṛṣṇa in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nāsti:</span> "There is no more higher authority than Me." Then, if you don't accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority, that is your business, but we accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So something is coming in that way because Kṛṣṇa, that was what He had said in a particular time or country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Authority means..., it does not mean a time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, for that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all try, try... Authority means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the time. That is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but later, later many lights shining...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (knock on door) Yes, open it. Anyway, to make cut short, to make cut short, so far we are concerned, we have declared, "International Society for Krishna Consciousness." Our process of propaganda is that Kṛṣṇa is the highest authority. That is our... You may take it that we are limited; that is your business. But we have taken this. Now, if you don't accept Kṛṣṇa as the higher authority, then there is no question of inquiring from us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is the form, you see, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the form. Here is Kṛṣṇa's form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, not that form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I mean is we are accepting anything to bring ourselves to certain destination which will satisfy us all. For that we are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing can satisfy everyone. That is not possible. There is no such thing within this material world which can satisfy everyone. There is no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, because... There may be so many "because." But the fact is that there is nothing in this material world which can satisfy everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There can be a method which can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe, but we do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Therefore beyond that, you see, I came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa. We accept Kṛṣṇa the supreme authority. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> Who is accepting this? We have accepted. Some others may have accepted but you have not accepted. So therefore even Kṛṣṇa's injunction is not accepted by everyone, what to speak of others? So therefore you cannot find out within this material world anything which can satisfy everyone. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have not found that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may think, but we have concluded that there is nothing, such thing, which can satisfy everyone. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Until we hear all, we may do that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be an ideal, but we take Kṛṣṇa as the highest authority. Even Kṛṣṇa's words are not accepted. That's a fact. Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me." So a few persons might have surrendered to Him. Even Kṛṣṇa was present, only the Pāṇḍavas and the inhabitants of the Vṛndāvana and Dvārakā, some of them understood that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. But many did not accept Him. Many insulted Him. Just like Śiśupāla insulted Him. So even Kṛṣṇa could not be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Accept, I accept everyone. That is no question of accepting or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, your... I have summarized that first of all you have come to inquire from us that our standard of knowledge is Kṛṣṇa. If you accept Kṛṣṇa as the standard of perfection of knowledge, then there is possibility of our talking. Otherwise simply waste of time. Why shall we waste our time? Our standard is Kṛṣṇa. If you are agreeable to accept the standard of Kṛṣṇa, then there is possibility. Just like here is a lawyer. He goes to the lawyer. He speaks, he pleads, on the standard of the lawbooks. If somebody comes, "No, no, I don't accept this," then there is no question of argument. Both the lawyers are arguing. The central point is the lawbook. So you must have a central point on which we shall talk. If you have no central point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Central point of happiness is there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, your point is happiness; my point is happiness. That is all right. But what is that happiness? Just like the same example can be that two litigants, they have gone to the court. Their aim is justice. But how that justice can be had, that is an argument and on the point of law. Similarly, everyone's point is happiness. And what is that standard of happiness, that you have to take from some authority. That authority we accept, Kṛṣṇa. And if you don't accept Kṛṣṇa, then we cannot come to the conclusion what is happiness. So you will simply waste our time. Begin <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> [break] You see? It was... Sometimes the light was coming, sometimes... That means they were adjusting. There was some meeting, adjusting. As soon as it is coming to the real point it was light. And as soon as not in the real point there is no light. So it is a science. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānam</span> It is a <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> It is not a theoretical, whimsical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is to be felt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah... Yes. It is to be learned, just like the electrician learns how to adjust the positive and negative wire, and as soon as it is rightly adjusted there is light. You cannot say, "No, no, why it shall be adjusted like this? It can be done like this." Oh, that will not give you light. You cannot speculate on the science. One plus... Two plus two equal to four. You cannot speculate, "Oh, can it not be three? Cannot be five?" No, that is not possible. You have to accept this two plus two equal to four. So the same example: so long it was not being adjusted to the right point, there was no light. So this adjustment... Suppose there is failure in my home. For this adjustment I have to call an experienced man. You may be a lawyer, you may be very nice thinker, but so far electricity is concerned, you have to call for a <span class="Italic">mistrī,</span> who may not be learned like you but he knows the art, how to do it, expert. Similarly, such a vast subject to understand God, you do not require the help of an expert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I did not take that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't mean you. Anyone. Anyone. If for ordinary things we have to call for an expert, to understand God is it not necessary to approach an expert? What do you think, Manuel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manuel:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Therefore the Vedas says, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ:</span> "In order to know that transcendental science," <span class="Italic">sa gurum evābhigacchet,</span> "he <span class="Italic">must</span> go to a guru. He must approach." A guru means not bogus guru. One who knows expert. But one has to do that. There is no other alternative. That is the injunction of every Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And this order is from the <span class="Italic">Kathopaniṣad.</span> Then, on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the same thing is said, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. Praṇipāta</span> means surrender. Surrender where? Where to surrender? To a coolie? No, to a superior person, guru. Similarly, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsur śreya uttamam: [SB </span>11.3.21] "One who is inquisitive to understand the spiritual science," <span class="Italic">tasmād,</span> "therefore," <span class="Italic">guruṁ prapadyeta,</span> "must surrender to a guru." Just our, this morning prayer is guru, beginning of life, beginning of day's work, first worshiping guru.</div>
<div class="Verse"> <span class="Italic">Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-<br class="calibre2"/>trāṇāya-kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam,<br class="calibre2"/>prāptasya kalyāṇa-guṇārṇavasya <br class="calibre2"/>vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam **</span> </div>
<div class="Purp-para">So in our, this Vedic way of life, to accept guru is essential. Even big, big <span class="Italic">ācārya...</span> Even Kṛṣṇa, He accepted guru, Sandipani Muni. Lord Caitanya accepted guru, Īśvara Purī. They are perfect, but still, the ways They are showing because They are <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Kṛṣṇa is teaching, taking the part of the <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> so he is also accepting, although the fact is as soon as went to, within a few days He learned everything. That is stated in our <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book.</span> Within a few days He became expert warrior, expert magician, expert yogi, every..., so many things, all arts. But He learned from a guru. He is perfect Himself, Kṛṣṇa. He is called Yogesvara. He knows all the yoga process, but still, in order to teach us, because He is playing the part of a teacher, He shows us that you must learn from guru. "I am learning from guru." So any science, you cannot learn it automatically by yourself. No, that is not. Then we shall create so many mental speculators, so many things. That will be not a science. Even all scientists, they accept a formula from an authority: "law of gravitation." They accept it. Then their physical, so many things they discover. But accept one formula. Just like this formula is given by Sir Isaac Newton. So they accept guru. So from all practical point of view, the things which are unknown to us, we have to accept a guru, for things unknown to us. Now, there is another verse. <span class="Italic">Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jātaḥ. Abodha-jātaḥ.</span> We are all born ignorant. Is it not? What do you think? Are we not born fools? Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānena...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I mean to say, take our present position. You were born, I am born, he is born, everyone. Are we not born foolish? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The only sense is cry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many ways we do not know. There is some trouble, I am crying, child is crying, and the mother knows that, "He is suffering. Give..." Seeking the help of the mother. Then we are going to a school. The father is training, mother is training. Are you not born foolish? In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">abodha-jātaḥ:</span> "born foolish." Everyone is born rascal. So if he does not take help from the authorities how he can make progress? You have become lawyer by sitting at home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, no, I take tests for many time. I look at books and I take test for one year, twelve, fourteen hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the process. So how can you deny to understand the supreme science-you can do it independently? No, that is not possible. Therefore it is the verb, the form, <span class="Italic">gacchet.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">vidhilinga.</span> You know Sanskrit? Yes. This form of verb is... Perhaps you also know. <span class="Italic">Gacchet, kuryat, gadyat.</span> These are <span class="Italic">vidhilinga. Vidhilinga</span> means that is compulsory. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows Sanskrit very well. Compulsory. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">gacchet</span>-compulsory. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārtham...</span> <span class="Italic">Tat,</span> the transcendental knowledge, <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> that is science. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva niścayate </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Eva</span> is <span class="Italic">niścayate. Eva</span> means certainly. And again <span class="Italic">gacchet,</span> "must go." Now, just like to be educated, one must be admitted in a school, must be. Now, what kind of school he has to select, that is another thing, but he must. That's a fact. Similarly, you have to accept a guru. Now, whom you will accept a guru, that is another thing. But you have to do it. That is the injunction of all <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> Vedic process is like that. This <span class="Italic">upanayana,</span> the sacred thread, <span class="Italic">upanayana. Upa</span> means near, and <span class="Italic">nayana</span> means bringing. <span class="Italic">Anayanam,</span> coming or going, like that, <span class="Italic">nayanam.</span> So "to go near the spiritual master," <span class="Italic">upanayana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Upanayana-saṁskāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And that sacred thread is the certificate that he has accepted a spiritual master. That is our Vedic system, identity, thread, sacred thread. So the <span class="Italic">upana...</span> The <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> is called <span class="Italic">upanayana-saṁskāra. Upanayana</span> means he has gone near the spiritual master. Therefore he is now <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> second birth. When a person goes to the spiritual master, that is his second birth because he is born foolish. Take birth by the combination of father, mother-that is material birth-that is a birth of ignorance, just like animals. The animals also take their birth in that way. There is no different process, the sex life. So what is the difference between animal and man? Therefore, <span class="Italic">upanayana, dvija.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ saṁskārad bhaved dvijaḥ.</span> Unfortunately there is no <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> at the present moment. So therefore they remain <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> A <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> means fourth-class. So how a fourth-class man can speculate on the science of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are not allowed to <span class="Italic">upanayana-saṁskāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no, no. Now, don't take that way. One who does not take <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> he is <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> because <span class="Italic">janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ.</span> Everyone is born <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But if one does not accept the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras,</span> he remains a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> not that <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are not allowed to take <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> Then how it is, that <span class="Italic">janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many instances. But this very word, "by birth one is <span class="Italic">śūdra,"</span> so there is no discrimination that "You are not <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> I am not...," by birth, <span class="Italic">abodha-jāto,</span> because he is born foolish rascal. Now, by <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> by culture, by education, he becomes <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> second birth. The practical example is these European and American students. They were doing all nonsense but since they have come to guru their life is reformed; therefore they are <span class="Italic">dvija. Saṁskārad bhaved dvijaḥ, veda-paṭhet...</span> Now, when he becomes <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> then he is allowed to study <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> not as a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> When we say <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> has no right to study <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that means he will not be able to understand. Just like you became lawyer, but the condition is, unless you become graduate, unless you have graduated yourself, you cannot enter law college. That does not mean law is prohibited for anyone. It is open for everyone, but first of all you make yourself university graduate; then enter law. Similarly, everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A particular standard of understanding should be qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So unless he has got <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> he is enlightened by culture and knowledge, unless he has become <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> then there is no authority for studying <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Veda-paṭhet.</span> After one has become <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> then he is allowed to study <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Janmanā jāyate śūdraḥ saṁskārad bhaved dvijaḥ,</span> and <span class="Italic">veda-paṭhed bhaved vipraḥ. Vipra.</span> Then he becomes... Gradually increasing, from <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> he comes to <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> then <span class="Italic">vipra.</span> And after being <span class="Italic">vipra,</span> after studying all the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> when he realizes Brahman, then he is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brahmā jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ.</span> So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that, gradual process, gradual process and to make him a qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And when he becomes <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then he knows Brahman. Then he makes spiritual progress. Without... Therefore, without becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nobody can make spiritual progress. That is the door of spiritual knowledge. Then he makes progress, makes progress. So after understanding Brahman knowledge, then he comes to Paramātmā knowledge, then he comes to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says, (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bala-mūrti-tejaḥ.</span> So this is the scientific process. It is <span class="Italic">vijñāna. Tad-vijñānam.</span> And in the Seventh Chapter in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated, <span class="Italic">jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ. Jñānaṁ vijñāna-sahitaṁ.</span> It is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> It is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna</span> means knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Vijñāna</span> is practical application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> When you apply <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> So <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> knowledge, first knowledge, is what is God, what is God and what is my relation with Him. This is knowledge. Then you... When you act according to that knowledge, that is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> When you understand fully well that "God is great, and I am a small minute part and parcels of God," and then you understand that the part and parcel's duty is to serve the whole... Is it not? Just like the finger is part and parcel of my body. Its duty is to serve the whole body. Similarly, if we accept, if we understand, that "I am part and parcel of God; then my duty is to serve God." But people are being misled that he is thinking God himself. Although he is under so many restrictions and stricture of the material nature. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāṇi guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is so foolish and rascal that he is thinking, "I am independent." <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā karta aham iti manyate.</span> He is strictly under the stringent laws of material nature, but still, he is thinking falsely that "I am supreme. I am independent." So therefore surrender required, that "I am not supreme." That is knowledge. That is knowledge in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate: [Bg. </span>7.19] "After many, many births of this speculation, when actually he becomes <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> wise, then he surrenders." <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless we surrender, so long we think that "I am independent, I am God, I am Supreme," these are all illusions. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is illusion, simply illusion. If I am God, how I have become so much dependent on the laws of material nature? Why I have accepted this body which I do not want? What kind of God I am? So the whole world is full of these ideas. So this movement is a revolutionary movement, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (Hindi) What is the meaning of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not... He does not know what is meaning of God. He thinks that God is something plaything. Therefore he claimed that "I am God." He does not know what is God. Therefore God personally showing-He's coming, Kṛṣṇa: "What is God, see." God is from very beginning God. Kṛṣṇa, from the birth He is God. He hasn't got to meditate. He hasn't got to go to the forest and..., to become God. He is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> God is made for, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not "God is made." God is never made. God is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But, sir, G means (Hindi?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your speculation. G means this, O means this, this means this. That you can interpret in so many ways but God is God. God is great. Brahman. Brahman means great, Parabrahman, the greatest. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. Is it not stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Before the birth of Lord Kṛṣṇa, was God existing? God exhibit temporally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to learn what is the birth of Kṛṣṇa. You do not know. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> You do not know what is the birth. You are thinking that He is, like ordinary man He has taken birth. Otherwise why does He say, <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyam yo jānāti tattvataḥ?</span> Nobody knows what is His birth? He thinks He's... Just like a child sees daily that the sun rises from the eastern side-therefore eastern side is the father of sun. Is eastern side father of the sun? Sun is always there, but you see in the morning it is appearing from the eastern side. That's all. It is your angle of vision, not that sun is born, taking birth from the eastern side. Sun is always there in the sky. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is always there but to the foolish person it appears that He is born. <span class="Italic">Ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā. Ajo 'pi:</span> "I have no birth." <span class="Italic">Ajaḥ.</span> This very word is used. <span class="Italic">Ajo 'pi sann avyayātmā bhūtānām īśvaro 'pi san.</span> So how you can compare Kṛṣṇa's birth like ordinary birth? If anyone knows what is Kṛṣṇa's birth he becomes liberated. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam yo jānāti tattvataḥ.</span> So that knowledge is not <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ</span> knowledge, that Kṛṣṇa's birth. Kṛṣṇa's birth is every moment. Just like sun. Now here it is not sunshine but in another place the sunshine is rising. So is that the birth, or when the sun will rise here, that will be birth? Which will be the birth of sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> It will always be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is already there but when you see, you see, you see that it is birth. The sunrise is already somewhere, and the sunset is also already somewhere but in your angle of vision there is no sun. That is going on. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa's birth, every moment; Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, every moment; Kṛṣṇa's existence, every moment. You have to learn that. Therefore Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyam [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> transcendental. <span class="Italic">Yo janati tattvataḥ.</span> Anyone who knows it perfectly, in truth, he becomes liberated. If you have known Kṛṣṇa, then you are liberated. But Kṛṣṇa knowing is not so easy. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ [Bg. 7.3].</span> It is very difficult to understand Kṛṣṇa in truth. Then how one can understand? That is also stated: <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not by speculation of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Bhaktya.</span> And what is that <span class="Italic">bhakti? Anyābhilaṣita-śunyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam, ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlānaṁ bhaktir uttama </span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">[</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> So these things you have to learn. Then there is possibility of knowledge, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñāna.</span> The difficulty is at the present moment the theory that everyone can invent his way of understanding God. He can speculate. Therefore there is chaos. There is chaos. If you want to save yourself from this chaotic condition of life you <span class="Italic">must</span> take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is our proposal. Give me that knife. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Not so many. Begin. <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> [break] ...friend of Kṛṣṇa. How much exalted he is, a great warrior, and he has the right to talk with Kṛṣṇa on equal level. Still, he accepted Kṛṣṇa as spiritual master. And he said, "The confusion which I have created, it is not possible for me to clear it. It is You only who can clear, I know. Therefore I accept You as spiritual master." Therefore it is required that one should know who can clear your confusion, and there you must surrender. (aside:) Anyone? Everyone. Come on. Not in the left hand. Don't give anything by left hand; don't take anything. That is a etiquette. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'll look on here this morning.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Oh, you haven't got. You have got? Hare Kṛṣṇa. (birds crying) The sunrise is declared. "Koo koo koo koo koo." Yes. Nature's way. They'll not sleep any more. Therefore anyone who sleeps after sunrise, he is a rascal. He's a rascal. Yes. A child at once, early in the morning, rise. That is nature. But we have created such a life that we have to break all the nature laws and therefore we suffer. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā, mām eva ye prapadyante</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And one who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is free. He is rising early. He has surpassed the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And those who are in <span class="Italic">māyā</span> they are sleeping. And those who are not in <span class="Italic">māyā</span> they are rising early in the morning. Is it not? <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante:</span> "Anyone who surrenders unto Me, he becomes free from the <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> contamination." Just see. There is <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati.</span> In Vṛndāvana just at four o'clock. You have heard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> I was just thinking, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately there is "dung, dung, dung, dung," all temples. Immediately. And people are running. Oh, they will gather all to the Deity, temple. Hundreds of people will go automatically. The same man who was living at home, a very degraded condition, as soon as he goes to Vṛndāvana he becomes habituated to all these things automatically. Automatically. Yes. The society, association, is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yamunā:</span> Those beautiful birds, the peacock birds also at this time, they are flying in trees and waking up now and make that sound. Oh, Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the society is very important thing. Any, anything, society... The businessmen, they have got their association, society, to improve. Therefore the standard of this International Society should be kept very carefully. Then who will come in touch with this society will be improved automatically by association. All right. Even in the bird society there are swans and there are crows, by nature, and the crows will never go to the swans, and the swans will never come to the crows. "Birds of the same feather flock together." Yes. Therefore society required. Unless you come to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society, how you can develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness? The same principle. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān... Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathaḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">. Vīrya-saṁvidaḥ.</span> It becomes very palatable, <span class="Italic">satāṁ prasaṅgāt,</span> in the association of devotees, not otherwise. (end)</div>
