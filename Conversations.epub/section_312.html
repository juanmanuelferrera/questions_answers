<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> ...the light is (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That means light becomes subordinate to the shadow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Uh, for his experience, for his growth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my..., that this experience... You have got some experience, I have got some experience and another has experience. But so far you are talking of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> Because you say that Aurobindo has written on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, Kṛṣṇa says:</div>
<div class="Verse">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat<br class="calibre2"/>kiñcid asti dhanañjaya<br class="calibre2"/>mayi sarvam idaṁ protaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sūtre maṇi-gaṇā iva<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.7]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Like that. He says that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataram:</span> "There is no more superior, supramental or Supreme Personality..." As you say supramental, it is with reference to a person. Just like Aurobindo, supramental. That means it is with reference to the Aurobindo person. Is it not? Any mental. As you say, "mental," it is with reference to a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Even if somebody says he is supramental or not, a yogi automatically, when he is in touch with the creative power, he gets the, gets the knowledge of past, present and future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why your knowledge and my knowledge different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because of our construction of mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That's it, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The vibration comes the same, but one poet may write a poetry of a very high..., you know, Shakespeare...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I've got... I made...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And another can be a lower form. But both of them are true. For me, even in the lower poetry's true, the higher is true. But it is a question of gradation merely, where the man has reached to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, everything is true, but higher true, or lower true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Both are true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both are true, but both are not the same thing. Then why higher and lower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because of his evolutionary stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Then higher must be taken as higher, lower must be taken as lower. Just like a child's mental condition and his father's mental condition, they are not the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, then today's lower, lower, higher, will be tomorrow's lower. Because tomorrow will be another unfolding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, but then you have to admit... Tomorrow he may be higher, but there, there is always the same thing, higher and lower. That you have to admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a manifestation of (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you have to accept... Just like your son, your son. Tomorrow he'll be grown up like you, but at the present moment, his mental condition, your mental condition, there are different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He's in evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, evolution. That, I understand. But these two things will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> As long as he's evolving and I'm evolving separately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> As individual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...because we are individualized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But do you think that Aurobindo's mental condition or your mental condition, the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then here is higher and lower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why "no"? One time you say, "No..." No, no, this is contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, sir, this is part (indistinct) higher and lower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Gradations, you can use words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, that will exist always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Always?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Always exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They will always exist? Gradations will always exist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a fact. Now where that evolution will end?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> When there is a world of <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> a new type of world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...as animals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, that is an expectation. That will never become. As you believe in Aurobindo, "When there will be," we say, "In the material world, there will be no such thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The Lord will be minus then, if He cannot create a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Lord is not minus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...a divine body on the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Lord is not minus. That you have to take information from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> as the Lord says, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this material world, it is everything <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāś...</span> Because you talked of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> therefore I am talking on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> states about this material world as <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is a place of miseries only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Provided this is the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Provided this is the body. When the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this body you have got. How you can deny?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But next evolution has to be another body only, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your expectation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. Already this, it is before us. The animals have come, and they, above the animals, we are there. We can't be the end of it. The next one is this yogic life, or a yogic body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then... What is that end. That you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It will be always unfolding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is always unknown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, the Lord is... Nobody can limit Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is, that is unknown to you. But according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is not unknown. There is a standard. There is a perfection stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> As long as I have got body, I can never know God fully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that's all right, so long you have got the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> All of our <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, you hear me. You have come to take some light. You kindly hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were talking on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I say on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So so long you have got this body, there is no perfection. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that if you understand the Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy, <span class="Italic">janma karma me...</span> First of all, you always remember that whatever we are talking, we are talking on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, what is Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">tyaktvā deham,</span> giving up this body, you'll not have to accept another material body. This is the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But so long you'll accept this body, material body, you'll remain imperfect. There cannot be any perfection. It may be gradation. There are eight million, four hundred forms of life. There is Brahmā, and there is ant also. Both of them are living entities. But the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> of the ant, and the <span class="Italic">status quo</span> of Brahmā is not the same, higher consciousness or mental... So they're all in the material world. None of them are perfect. Between Brahmā and ant, there are millions of other living entities, eight million. Not only one million. Millions. 8,400,000 forms of life. They're all imperfect because they have accepted this material body, either Brahmā or ant, but your perfection will come when you do not accept this material body. That is the, I mean to, the destination of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti: [Bg. </span>4.9] "After quitting this body, he does not accept any more this material body." This, that means he, he becomes perfect. That is stated in another place. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ. Saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam, nāpnuvanti mahātmānaḥ saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">. Mām upetya.</span> Find out this... Now, unless you take some standard book of knowledge, we cannot talk. If you talk whimsically, I talk whimsically, then there will be no end of talk. We have to... Because you told me the other day: "In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span>" That is all right. Here is a standard. Everyone accepts. Now..., You have found it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām upetya punar janma... [Bg. </span>8.15].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām upetya tu kaunteya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> May I ask you a question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you don't ask. We are talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> <span class="Italic">Ā-brahma...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>punar āvartino 'rjuna<br class="calibre2"/>mām upetya tu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>punar janma na vidyate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 8.16]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now here is the perfectional stage. Now what is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> "From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place, but one who attains to My abode, O son of Kuntī, never takes birth again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So as soon as you have to take birth, you have to die. Just like Aurobindo took birth; he died. Everyone. Everyone, even Brahmā. It may be a long duration or a small duration. That doesn't matter. Everyone. That is the perfectional knowledge, how to solve this birth and death problem. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> As soon as we are under these clutches of birth and death, old age and disease, we are imperfect. We are imperfect. Whatever I may be, you may be, but if I am subjected to birth, death, old age and disease, then I am imperfect. Therefore the perfectional, perfection of life is when you haven't got to take birth or die or become diseased and old. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That world must be somewhere in existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is. That is, that is indicated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yad gatvā na nivartante tad... [Bg. 15.6].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But that, the pressure of that world can come on our world also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that world will not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...can become our world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That knowledge... Just like we are getting this knowledge. Kṛṣṇa came. Kṛṣṇa is giving us the knowledge. You can get the knowledge and make your life perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, But that world must be in existence somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is existing. That is existing. Yes. That is... That is stated here in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But we can bring it down here with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not your servant, that you can bring it down. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Somebody has to work for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another, I mean to say, rascal proposition. You cannot bring that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Somebody has to. Because the creation can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. "Somebody has to," that is your theory. But that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The creation is always unfolding, more and more, and becoming of more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Creation is already there. Your knowledge is imperfect. You do not know what is that creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Few billion years before there was no human being living here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom, that statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Pardon me, Sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascaldom. Foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Foolishness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, today...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because, because you say, "Two millions of years ago..." Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Six billion, whatever you may say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Whatever amount of time, one can say, before that, there was no life here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but Vedic literature, Vedic literatures, you see. These four <span class="Italic">yugas.</span> Now, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> We are talking always: <span class="Italic">Sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> You study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You'll understand. <span class="Italic">Sahasra-yuga-paryantam.</span> One <span class="Italic">yuga</span> means forty-three lakhs of years. And multiply by... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Mrs. Nair has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let her come in, yes. And forty-three lakhs of years, multiply it by one thousand. Then how much it comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Forty-three multiplied by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-three lakhs multiplied by one thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Four hundred thirty crores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty crores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Four hundred thirty crores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is only twelve hours of Brahmā. So what you can two million?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no. I said six billion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six billion, you may say, but this is only twelve hours of Brahmā. So just see how long he's living. Hundreds of millions of years he's living, still. And you say two millions years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, when you say Brahmā, you mean Supreme or the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Brahmā is a person like you and me. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) Brahmā is also a living entity. Just like... (Hindi) We are all living entities. Similarly, Brahmā is also a living entity. Just like you are bigger than the ant, Brahmā is bigger than me. That is the difference only. But he's also living entity. So he lives for millions and millions of years. (Hindi) So the other gentleman not yet, not has yet come, our Asnani. So let him come. Then we shall begin talking. So it is not a fact that two millions of years ago, there was no living entity. This is all rascaldom. Time is immemorial, and many, many millions of years ago there were living entities, more perfect living entities. They're still living. But we have no information. Just like Brahmā. Brahmā's one twelve hours, if you believe in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...,</span> statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā... sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> Read that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, that, this forty-three lakhs of years, multiplied by one thousand, how many years it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Four hundred thirty crores.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest 2 (Indian man):</span> Four thousand, three hundred crores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. So four thousand, three hundred crores, that is day. And similarly night. Now this becomes complete twenty-four hours. Similarly one month. Similarly one year. He lives for one thousand, one hundred years. Now calculate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You have a total here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You have a total here.</div>
