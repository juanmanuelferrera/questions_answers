<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...meeting, our life members are not coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, it is (indistinct). Many life members came, Prabhupāda. There were many cars also. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No mangoes are hanging. [break] "Kṛṣṇa is everything," is little difficult for everyone, eh? They want hodge-podge-"Everything is all right." So has anybody offered some lump sum for the construction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Not as yet, Prabhupāda. Actually they are all waiting for Mr. Piti(?) to make his pledge. They have some kind of... These Marwaris... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not see Hari Prasad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, yes, his whole family was there. Mr. Pulla Reddy was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Pulla Reddy, I have seen. [break] He is so much convinced in with our philosophy in Bombay, he is going to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, in Hare Kṛṣṇa Land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Although he is officially Shaivite, but he says that "I am so much convinced with your speech."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Who is that person, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not remember the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> He lives in that same building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Downstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Oh. He comes to every one of your lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I will just tell him that we do not need the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...between <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta</span> and <span class="Italic">nitya-baddha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> The <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta</span> devotees, Prabhupāda, they are always engaged in the service of the Lord, and every thought of theirs is engaged at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, of serving Him completely. And when they appear on this earth, persons like yourself, they only come here for the purpose of reclaiming the fallen conditioned souls. They have no reason to come to this material world for their own enjoyment. That is never on their mind. But the <span class="Italic">nitya-bandhas,</span> they are here simply to try and manipulate this material nature so that they can engage their own senses in gratification either of themselves or their extended self like their family. So the difference between the two is one is serving Kṛṣṇa, the other is simply serving his senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Eternally liberated and eternally conditioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternally liberated, they never forget Kṛṣṇa. There is no period throughout the existence... There is no question of existence. It is their all existence. Never touched by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> forgetfulness. That is <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were talking that a person, he can come up to that position of <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta</span> by either following the principles of <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti</span> or causeless mercy, or you said there was also the question of <span class="Italic">kṛpā,</span> the <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddhi,</span> that one can attain perfection...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> One gets mercy by <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the stage of <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti... Sadhana-bhakti</span> is for the conditioned soul. And <span class="Italic">siddha. Siddha</span> means they are already mature. <span class="Italic">Siddha</span> means <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> [break] Also, Prabhupāda you said that if one does not worship Pañca-tattva, whatever actions he performs, even if he is so-called <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakta,</span> is to be considered offensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Does this mean other <span class="Italic">sampradāyas</span> also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other <span class="Italic">sampradāyas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> For instance, <span class="Italic">Rāmānuja sampradāya</span> or also <span class="Italic">Madhva-sampradāya,</span> they sometimes don't accept Pañca-tattva as being supreme. So is their actions also considered offensive even if they are acting within <span class="Italic">sampradāya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...Rāmānuja sampradāya,</span> do they have a chain of disciplic succession, bona fide chain, to this present day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And the other <span class="Italic">sampradāyas</span> also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Chain must be there. Now, whether strictly following the..., that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> [break] ...invited us to their program at Udupi, <span class="Italic">Madhva-sampradāya.</span> When they are changing the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> every two years, they extended one invitation to come for their program, main temple program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why did you not accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> There was no transportation available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transportation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Should we go to such programs, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they invite, why not? That means they recognize. But one thing, you be certain whether this Tirupati temple is going to allow our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I will send somebody tomorrow in advance to make preparations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> To Tirupati. Actually Guru-kṛpa and Yaśodā-nandana, they've had <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of Lord Bālajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then it is all right. They had no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. And also Maṇibandha had once been, last time in the Hyderabad program was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> They gave Guru-kṛpa and Yaśodā-nandana special <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> They took them into the circle where usually they'd only let special people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then it is all right. Then that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> [break] ...very impressed because we have <span class="Italic">nāgara-kīrtana</span> all over the place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> And if they are impressed, they can, when our construction starts, they will be very willing to also give a very huge donation. They are capable of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many people are going altogether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> About fifteen devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. So we have to go by plane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> No, we will go by bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Bus is going every day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, there is two very special buses. It costs forty-two rupees per ticket to go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...wood is the strongest of all wood, this. (taps wood with cane or something) Very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What kind of wood is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is guava tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Guava, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You know what is that <span class="Italic">lattu,</span> we used to play? What is the English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Spinning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like a small, and we used to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, top, a top. Like that. It's top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Top. What is called, top?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> That is made of this, Prabhupāda? Oh. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> [break] ...tops to gamble. That's part of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gambling religion. Now here also, they are advertising gambling, this government. Deteriorating, the whole world is deteriorating and suffering. Suffering is increasing. Still they are so rascal, they cannot understand that what is the advancement. They have become so less intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Usually, though, it is the children. They gamble for cookies and candy and things like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, children they learn it from their parents. Otherwise they do not know. [break] ...by memory, by mercifulness... People are not so merciful now. Suppose in your presence somebody is being killed. You avoid to stand there. No more merciful. What to speak of the animals? If a man is killed, nobody will take care. I have heard it in America that if somebody is killed or attacked, nobody will go to help. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the mercifulness has gone. And what to speak of religiosity? That is completely gone. These things will reduce: mercifulness, religiosity, memory, bodily strength, and so many, eight, eight. They are mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Religious principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> And you were writing that it is just a little bit of truthfulness is left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You secure <span class="Italic">dhātun</span> from the tree. Ask them. The three <span class="Italic">dhātun</span> they gave, that is finished. [break] ...water is full, one can take bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Swimming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...that these <span class="Italic">Old</span> and <span class="Italic">New Testament</span> and <span class="Italic">Koran,</span> they are the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> of the (sic:) <span class="Italic">yauvanas.</span> They are not the same as the Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> They are not as... They are not bona fide like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Does this mean they are not authentic or... How did they come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> These <span class="Italic">Bible</span> and <span class="Italic">Koran,</span> how did they get here? They were just inventions or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Convention means they are partially good for the time being, that's all. They are not eternally... Just like in the Bible it is said, "Thou shalt not kill." (chuckles) But this is not, does not come within the category of eternal religion. People were so corrupted that they were forbidden, "No, don't do this." "Thou shalt not covet," a little moral instruction. That also, they could not follow. There is no religion. And little God consciousness, "There is God, kingdom of God," little idea for the persons who could understand. Otherwise, do you think that if somebody says, "Thou shalt not kill," is that any religious principle? It is ordinary thing. Where is the question of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> These things, they are also in (sic:) <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for... <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> forbids completely. <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> is not religion. It is moral principles for conducting society. Religion is how to become devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is religion. That is natural. [break] "...shalt not kill," this is expectation. "Someday, in future, one may become religious." That's all. Because by killing, killing, they are going downer, down. So if they stop killing, some day they will be able to understand what is religion. <span class="Italic">Sukṛti.</span> Because, without being freed from all sinful activities, nobody can understand what is God. Therefore about God, in India they can understand very easily. In other countries they cannot. Very few because always engaged in sinful activities, all forbidden sinful activities. Just like you said that gambling has been introduced in religion. Killing has been introduced in religion. What is that religion? The more they take to the sinful activities, the more they become implicated-again birth and birth and birth and birth. Unless one is completely free, he cannot understand what is God. <span class="Italic">Yeṣam anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> You know this verse? The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> When one becomes free of sinful activities, then he can begin devotional life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">To stick to Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> is not so easy, that you will go on committing all sinful activities and you will become Kṛṣṇa devotee. That is not possible. You have to give up, and you have to come. But this is the process. You will be free, and you will understand. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa kṛpāya</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one follows bona fide guru's instruction and he is engaged in devotional service, then it is possible. Then it is possible. Otherwise, if he does whimsically then it will be a failure. He must carry out the instruction of the guru, bona fide guru. Guru means bona fide guru, not pseudo guru. And according... What guru will advise? To be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. These two things will help him. Otherwise it is not possible. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya:</span> "By the mercy of guru and by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa." So both of them should be served. That is the process, not that "Now I have become advanced devotee. I don't require to serve guru." Neither, "Oh, I am serving my guru. I don't care for Kṛṣṇa," no. Parallel line. Not that "One line I can walk," no. Parallel line. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore in our temple, along with Deities, guru is also worshiped. <span class="Italic">Guruṣu nara-matiḥ,</span> if one accepts guru-"Guru is guru, guru is guru"-as ordinary human being, then that is offense, <span class="Italic">nārakī buddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> That kind of worship is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Janme janme pita sei. Cakhu-dan kilo jei, janme janme pita sei.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Where is that <span class="Italic">śloka</span> you were quoting last night from that ending <span class="Italic">gokala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Go-kharaḥ, go-kharaḥ.</span> That is in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhiḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma idya-dhīḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> You give him that śloka, (indistinct). So actually at the present moment the whole world is full of <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ,</span> that's all, animals. Everyone thinks in terms-"I am this body," that's all. He is not human being, but every so-called civilized man is thinking like that. So where is the civilization of human being? All <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥs,</span> animals. [break] ...because if you keep all these ingredients, life will come. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> When the soul is entering, they are all complete?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. If you keep... A man is dead, and keep his body. So it will decompose, but the life will come. So many worms will come. So these are... If you say that chemicals, these material, then the chemicals are there, and life is coming. Now you take this chemical and prepare. You cannot say, "Although these chemicals are there, there is some deficiency. Therefore the life is not coming." No, why do you say like that? Life is coming. That man is not coming, but the life is coming. So these are ingredients for life. You prepare. You bring that man. Still, the rascal will say that life is made from matter. Not even gentlemen, what to speak of becoming scientist? You prepare. "No, in future we shall see." And he is getting Nobel Prize. Just see how the human society has become full of rascals, <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ.</span> They cannot prove; still they will insist, "Yes." And so far God is concerned, we learn from <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that God's two energies are working like heat and light. So energies are working, we can see. How these mangoes have come unless there is some energy? So therefore the energy is working. Therefore God is there. Just like as soon as light is there, although we are in the room we can understand that sunlight is there. As soon as the darkness is there, we understand that there is no more sun. So in the presence of energy... Just like in the motor car, before starting, you round the key, and it becomes, "Gut, gut, gut, gut." Now your current is there. The energy is there. So there are symptoms. By symptoms we can understand there is God. Where is the difficulty? And Kṛṣṇa is explaining, "Here, just see the symptom. The taste in the water I am." Then why do you say that you have not seen God? You are liar. You create that taste? Now take sea water and make that taste. Why do you take water from here and there? Sea water is there. Now you take it, and by chemical you create the taste. Why don't you? Therefore, unless God is there, you cannot do that, or God's sanction, you cannot do that. This is reasonable understanding of God, apart from seeing God. And because the taste is there-Kṛṣṇa says-therefore God is there. According to your capacity, you have to see God like that. You cannot see immediately Kṛṣṇa, with <span class="Italic">dvi-bhuja muralī,</span> playing on flute. That you have no capacity. You have to see God like that. So when the rubber stamp is going to be delivered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I will bring it today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one must be intelligent enough to see God. Now, the bird I do not see, but I am hearing the sound. So one must know there is a nice bird. Because the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is lacking, nobody is being educated as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> They have lost all knowledge. Suppose in the society there is nobody educated as engineer; you don't find any engineers. So who will understand this? Unless one becomes brahminical qualified, they cannot understand. Therefore a class of men must be there, trained up as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then the understanding of God consciousness will be there. Otherwise finished. So now this rascal civilization, they are simply creating <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> What they will understand? Simply <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Factories and this, for technology. And because they are getting money, they are thinking, "Now we have got everything." On the money standard. Actually they have no knowledge. Just like we find a expert electrician and we pay him sufficiently, say hundred dollars, but does it mean that he has knowledge? He is expert in that <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> work, that's all. That does not mean, because he has got money, he has got all knowledge. But people accept, "Oh, he has money. His life is successful. He has got all knowledge." That's all. And if you go, if you speak about God, "Oh, these men are beggars. They have made a profession." That's all. So if the society does not accept the proposition of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> they will suffer because the God consciousness will be lost. It is already lost. It may not be that everyone is God conscious, but a section... Just like it may not be that everybody is a physician, but a physician must remain there, must be there so that when one is difficulty by disease, the physician may help him. Similarly, if in the society the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class and above, post-graduate of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class, Vaiṣṇava, is not there, then the whole society will spoil . They will indulge in this meat-eating and drinking wine and illicit sex. Then it will be hell, and it has already become. Whole world is full of hellish person. In a civilized country like America you cannot walk alone in the street at night. India is still honest. Any part of India, you can walk. Because the more sinful. Is it not? In New York, especially in Brooklyn or anywhere, you cannot walk alone. Is it not? Yes. Your life is at risk. That Central Park, nobody can walk there. I have heard from many women that they rape. The negroes, they capture and rape. Life is unsafe even in a civilized city like New York. So what is this civilization? Our (name withheld) was... [break] ...Park. (Name withheld) our. Yes, she said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> She said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, she said. She was captured by a group of negroes to rape her. [break] That girl, what is his name? (name withheld) wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> (Name withheld).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was raped.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. She was raped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> How do you teach a <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college? In <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college if somebody comes in... They say, "I want to be <span class="Italic">kṣatriya"</span> or "I want to be <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span>" Is it like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that will be tested by the teachers, what for he is fit. He will be test by the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Who will teach him to be a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or who will teach him to be a <span class="Italic">vaiśya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Just like if you want to learn music, you have to go to a musician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So where will we get <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Anyone can learn it. Just like if you want to be doctor, so you must have this qualification. Similarly, these things are stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Kṣatriya</span> means if there is fight, he must go forward first of all, risking his life. That is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So we have men who could teach this? Do we have men...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Because he knows how to teach. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they all become devotee... They would all be engaged in devotional life as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also devotion, to teach a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> because this is necessary in the society. This is also devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> And <span class="Italic">vaiśyas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like when Kṛṣṇa is fighting. Kṛṣṇa is fighting, killing the demons. So that is also devotion, if you help Kṛṣṇa by killing demons, not that simply by chanting, you supply... Just like Bhismadeva. He even injured Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa took it very pleasant. Instead of throwing flowers, he pierced His body with arrow. So everything for the service. If Kṛṣṇa is pleased being pierced by the arrow the devotee will do that. His only business is how to please Kṛṣṇa. Just like, the example is given by Viśvanātha Cakravartī that when a man kisses a woman and bites her, she becomes pleased. Is it not? Is not a fact that that biting is pleasing? Is it pleasing? But sometimes it is pleasing. So one has to learn where to bite and when to... (chuckles) But if a rascal thinks that "Biting is pleasing. I shall bite always," then he is a rascal. (laughter) [break] ...lying down on the Yamunā beach, on the sand with His friends. And if we think, "No, there is no need of bedding of Kṛṣṇa. He was lying down on the Yamunā beach, so He will lie down on the floor." So is... That conclusion is very nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we must know how to please Kṛṣṇa. Generally, the <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> that is pleasing. Therefore these rules and regulation for everyone. But when one becomes mature devotee, he knows how to please Kṛṣṇa. He knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> One question came up the other day when I was talking with this clergyman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Clergyman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, that man I was talking to was a clergyman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he was?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> He was on the airplane when we were coming here to Hyderabad. And he was asking what our program was. And I was telling him that first of all, in order to relieve the confusion of society, we wanted to establish the Vedic culture with this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system. And he asked me what would be the program that we would have for a man who works in the factory...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Would we retrain him as a farmer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if he is prepared. If not, let him remain. But we can utilize that <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> He can remain in the factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But he cannot do the work of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He cannot be trained as a preacher. But he can help. Just like my legs. The legs cannot do the work of brain, but it can help me. I am walking. So leg is as important as the brain. Similarly, <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is as important as the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> provided he helps the movement, Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is wanted, not that artificially a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> should be working as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no. But everyone should be engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> So in that case he is a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and he is also doing the work of a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is not a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> One who is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, he is neither <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He is devotee. He is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]. Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Apparently he looks like <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Just like we have got so many men from different quarters, but we do not belong to that quarter any more. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> Therefore anyone who takes, "Oh, here is an American Vaiṣṇava, here is an Indian Vaiṣṇava," that is <span class="Italic">nārakī.</span> He is Vaiṣṇava. That understanding required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Just like that devotee who was making garlands for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He is a devotee. He is not a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> making garlands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He is not a ordinary gardener.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Or that devotee who was making leaf bowls for worshiping the Ganges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any engagement, any engagement for Kṛṣṇa, he is Vaiṣṇava. If he is under the guidance of his spiritual master and doing the business according to the direction, he is Vaiṣṇava. He is above all these.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> A <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> if he is working, he cannot take <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> initiation, but he can take <span class="Italic">hari-nāma,</span> is that it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like sometimes our men, my devotee, they wash the cupboard. Does it mean he is a <span class="Italic">methar</span>(?)? No. He can go to the Deity room also. He is not a <span class="Italic">methar</span>(?) or sweeper. But sometimes we do that. So devotee is above all these consideration. But because there is management, they should appear as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> as <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> like that.</div>
<div class="Verse">sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/>māṁ ca vyabhicariṇi<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">A devotee, because he is working as a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> he is not a <span class="Italic">śūdra;</span> neither he is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He is already in the spiritual platform. But for management we have to do that. One can do the <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> work nicely-let him be engaged in that way. Why he should imitate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Does he get second initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything he will get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He gets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Second initiation means recognized: "Now he has become fully competent Vaiṣṇava." Just like master is teaching the servant, "Now you give massage in this way, this way." But that does not mean he has become servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What if the person working as <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> says, "I can do so much. I can...,"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, try to understand. A devotee is neither <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He may act like a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> but he is not <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He may act like a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa;</span> he is not <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He is Vaiṣṇava. Just like <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> The <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they are village cowherds women. They are, according to social construction, they are not very high class. They did not belong to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class. But their worship, method of worship, has been taken the highest. <span class="Italic">Ramyā kācid upāsanā vrajavadhū-vargeṇa.</span> They were village girls, and practically their character was also not good. Because at dead of night they are going to Kṛṣṇa. But why they have been taken as the most topmost devotee of Kṛṣṇa? Because the love was so high class. It is the test, how much one has learned to love Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. Apparently he may appear as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. The only business is to see: <span class="Italic">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adho... [SB </span>1.2.6].<span class="Italic"> Aiye.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What if the person cannot chant sixteen rounds a day. He says, "I can't..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is not even a human being. He is a rascal. That's all. He is not a human being. What to consider of talking...? Don't talk about him if he cannot chant sixteen rounds. He is not even a human. He is animal. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...even he may be employed as factory worker or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if you take factory workers are better than animals, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> One point that you made a few years ago in Vṛndāvana was that this demoniac civilization, especially in U.S.A., keeps a man so much engaged, they make them work so hard, just to earn the simple necessities of life, that they don't have time to cultivate spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if he likes, he can get time because he is not in the factory twenty-four hours. But if one... That is explained, <span class="Italic">apratihatā.</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot be checked by any material condition. If anyone wants to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is not checked. So there is nothing impediment, provided he wants to become. In any condition of life, <span class="Italic">sthane sthitaḥ,</span> if he simply hears about Kṛṣṇa then everything is all right. He will gradually catch up everything and adjust things. But if he has no ears to hear about Kṛṣṇa, then it is difficult. Therefore <span class="Italic">śravaṇam.</span> The first thing is that. The first qualification-he must be eager to hear about Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will come. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇam pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...such devotees that they do service, they may be very big, they attract so many people, they are successful, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and everything, but we know they are not chanting <span class="Italic">japa.</span> What can we do in that situation? Are we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Situation, he is doing some service. He is doing some service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So because on account of that service, if he could not, that can be excused. But not that practice should be taken as permanent business. The regulation is that if you cannot finish your chanting that day, then next day you should forget sleeping and eating and must finish it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Some persons we encounter they don't even chant at all, and yet we are in association with them, and they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you miss on account of busy-ness, then next day you must finish it. You should not go to sleep. You should not... Yes, that day you should forget all other business. First of all compensate this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Some devotees have it as a chronic condition, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But still, he's doing lots of good devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> He may even be manager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they will get some chance later on. What is that devotee, if you do not follow the regulative principles? The business is that if one day you cannot, but finish. The next day you must finish. Now, for eating, he is very eager, and for sleeping, he is very eager, and for finishing chanting, he has no eagerness. Then he is animal. It is simply an excuse. Yesterday you had no time? You were very busy? All right. Today you forget your sleeping and eating. Finish it. That is wanted. [break] And only for chanting, you have no time. This is not allowed. This is not allowed. This is cheating, that "I am so busy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Most of these devotees in Hyderabad, they are chanting twenty-five rounds a day or more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. If you can chant more, that is good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...must associate with them, that is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do your business. You don't follow them. That's all. You remain perfect. There are many imperfects, admitting, but you try to remain perfect so that they may see you, your behavior, and they may follow you. If everyone is sincere in his activity, then where is the question? The society means if I am defective, I am seeing that you are doing nicely, so I will be ashamed. That is also teaching. Actually that should be the practice. If I cannot finish my sixteen rounds due to some business, then next day I must finish it. If you say that "Next day also, I am busy," then you should forego your eating and sleeping and finish it. That is the way. You are so busy, but you do not forget your eating and sleeping. That is cheating. If you are so busy that you forget your eating and sleeping, then I can consider that you are very busy. But you do not forget this portion. "Whenever there is opportunity, I sleep and eat. And I have no time for chanting"-this is cheating. How long you can go on by cheating? You must finish it. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Somebody, after initiation he promises, "Yes, I shall follow these rules and regulations. I shall chant sixteen rounds," before the fire, before the Deity, before the guru, and if he does not follow, then he is a cheater. What to speak of his becoming a Vaiṣṇava, he is a cheater. He breaks all his promises. Therefore after seeing, observing a person is doing everything, then say second initiation, or then he should not be recommended for second initiation unless the president and the other authorities see that he is doing nicely, he is following. Otherwise he should not be recommended. If he is recommended, that is also another cheating. If you know that this person is not following the rules and regulation, then why should you recommend him? Then it is another cheating. <span class="Italic">Viddhi-bhakti</span> must be followed; otherwise it becomes <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span> [break] ...Kerala?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can understand that he is not very favorable. But still, you said that we hate Hindi. You have said like that. Don't say like that because there may be one... Because preaching means we have to preach amongst the rascals but you do not become rascal. He may be... [break] "...Who will read Hindi? You do not... Who will read Hindi? You can read Hindi, that's all. But who will read outside Hindi? Therefore, Guru Mahārāja..." This should have been the reply. "If there is good customers for Hindi reading, then we can write Hindi books. But nobody will read Hindi." That should have been the reply. Therefore we write in English. "Why Jawaharlal Nehru read his books in English? Why Dr. Radhakrishnan writes his books in English? He has not written a single book in Hindi. Why? Why he was president? Why he was prime minister? Why did you not criticize him?" That should have been replied, that "As soon as a book is written in English, it is for world reading. And if it is written in Hindi, who is going to read except a few people like you? Why still Indians, they are sending their children for education through English?" You know that? There are so many English medium school. Is it not? Yes. Why? Why they are anxious? So much agitation was made for studying Hindi, but then why India still, even in families they are talking in English? In Bombay they talk in English amongst family members. And any gentleman meets another gentleman-he talks in English. Why it has not been stopped? So actually Hindi has no effect and if we take international rule, what is the use of Hindi? Nobody will like to... And even here, even here in India, who is reading Hindi? Nobody is reading Hindi. It is compulsory in every province, Hindi? Not compulsory. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Not Hindi, also they are developing local languages, they are teaching English letters now. The latest, they send their childrens to the English medium schools.</div>

Everywhere we are making life members but why do they accept these English books? They could have refused, "No, no, no, I cannot accept English book." Why they are accepting? I know one boy. He is about forty-two years. But he was practically my first student. He is a very big scholar in Sanskrit. But because he does not know English, he is useless. He could not make any, prosper in any way. He is taken as half-educated. He was appointed as vice-chancellor of the Darbhana(?) Sanskrit University. Maybe it is only name. Anyway, now his teaching period is over. Now he is useless. He does not get any service. Although he is a very big Sanskrit scholar.
