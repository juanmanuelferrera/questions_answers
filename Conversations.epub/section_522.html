<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Says something in Hindi) [break] ...different desires, they are getting different conditions of life. Therefore we find so many species and forms of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (Indian Press Representative):</span> Is it possible, some of our..., is it possible on the spiritual platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the only platform where...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But do you think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is after being <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But are all religions following? There are so many sects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to... No, why according? This is fact. Religion which is not on the <span class="Italic">samyavāda,</span> that is not religion. That is some mental concoction. This <span class="Italic">samyavāda</span> platform is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> as I have quoted already, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one is spiritually realized, that is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> and the symptom is <span class="Italic">prasannātmā.</span> So when one is <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> naturally he is on the <span class="Italic">samyavāda</span> platform. On the material platform, nobody is <span class="Italic">prasannātmā.</span> Nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But on the spiritual platform, everybody?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritual platform means <span class="Italic">prasannātmā.</span> That is the distinction. And the material platform means nobody is satisfied. A man, millionaires, he is also committing suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But do you think that all men can stand on the spiritual platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All men can stand or not stand-that is a different question. The fact is this. Suppose if I say, "Unless you become a graduate, you cannot enter law college." Now this question does not arise that whether everyone will be graduate. But this is the condition. This is the condition. Anyone who fulfills this condition, he can be admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Then what is the condition prescribed for standing on the spiritual platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the spiritual platform,</div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is spiritual. Unless you come to this platform, there is no question of <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu</span> or <span class="Italic">samyavāda.</span> Generally, they do not know it. They are talking of <span class="Italic">samyavāda.</span> They do not know what is the platform of <span class="Italic">samyavāda.</span> That is also further explained in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">. Bhāgavata, śāstra,</span> all Vedic literatures, they are perfect. So people do not know what is the aim of life. Therefore they have got different views. Actually they are missing what is the aim of life. There is a English proverb, "A man without aim and a ship without rudder," or something like that. So similarly, ask anybody what is the aim of life. He doesn't know, no clear idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Our aim of life should be the realization of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because at the present moment we are part and parcel. Just like a son, he has got the symptoms of his father, but he does not know who is his father. He does not know who is his father. There is a Hindi proverb, <span class="Italic">bap ka beta sipaika gora kusnaita tora tola:</span> "The son inherits the quality of the father, but if he does not know who is his father, then what is his position?" That is going on. The scientist, he is trying to create something, but he does not know the supreme creator. Do you follow? Now the scientists are trying to create living being in the laboratory. But he does not enquire that who has already created so many millions of living entities? He is trying to create a living entity in laboratory. Suppose he creates one living entity. Then what credit is there for him? But he is spending <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">crores</span> of rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Then what should the scientists' role?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists' role, not only scientists, scientists, philosopher, politician-everyone should endeavor that "Wherefrom we got these propensities? Where is the origin?" That is described in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra: <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> I am a scientist. I am thinking of myself very great man, but I do not think that "Who is that great scientist under whose order the sun, moon, the sea, ocean, everything is working very properly?" I am thinking of that water is created by hydrogen, oxygen, but I do not inquire, "Wherefrom such hugh quantity of hydrogen, oxygen came, so that there is big oceans and seas, water?" That I don't enquire. So I am so foolish scientist. I am theorizing. I am theorizing that life has come from matter, chemical composition, but as soon as I ask that "I give you the chemical. You create," he says, "That I cannot do." This is going on. But our business is, we Kṛṣṇa conscious, that we see that you scientists, you are trying to create a living being, but I glorify the Supreme who has already created millions and millions of living beings. I give you credit that... I cannot give you credit unless you create. But still, as you are thinking that you will be able in future, that's good... But what credit you will have? If I have got millions of rupees, and if you create ten rupees, then what is your credit? Even if you create? You cannot do it. You will never be able to create life. That's a fact. That we know. But even if you are able to create, then what credit you, do you get. This is... Already there are millions and trillions of life. Why you are so proud that "We are going to create in the laboratory, life." Why this false prestige?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So what is the idea behind the movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Behind the movement, that... This is the idea, that you try to understand the Supreme Being behind all, everything. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā</i>. Everyone, big, big philosophers, scientists, they are engaged in <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> and education, but they do not know what is the ultimate goal of this <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> The scientist is working very hard, and he has discovered a nuclear bomb to kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And what is the ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">tapasya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> means that by his knowledge... Suppose you are scientist. You prove by scientific way that here is the supreme scientist who has given us all these laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is it possible to see the Supreme?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> With our own eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Even if it is not possible, but you have to accept there is a supreme scientist. If you cannot see Him, that is your disqualification. That is your disqualification. But you have to admit that there is a supreme scientist. If you say that hydrogen and oxygen mixed together makes water, that's all right. But who has created this big sea and ocean? Wherefrom the hydrogen, oxygen came? Who supplied? That is intelligence. Simply theoretical I know, but I cannot say who has created this big, vast mass of water by mixing hydrogen, oxygen. Wherefrom such huge quantity of hydrogen, oxygen came? Our point of view, that you scientists, you say that hydrogen, oxygen creates water, and here we see that somebody has created, but not somebody will know who is that body, how great He is. And that is our credit. If you want little credit by experimenting, hydrogen, oxygen mixed together, then how much credit should be given who has created the vast Atlantic Ocean, not only one, millions! Why don't you give credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You should give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But are you not giving credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody is giving. They are denying. Especially these so-called scientists, they are denying the existence of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "God is dead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "God is dead" or "There is no God." "By science, we shall do everything," and this and..., all nonsense theories. Our proposition is that glorify that supreme scientist. <span class="Italic">Yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And the supreme scientist is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's God. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> God, or you can give another name as you like, any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God or the Supreme Being. God means the Supreme Being in the dictionary. He is not like you, not like me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, He is supreme. We are not supreme. But this subordinate person, he wants to take the position of the supreme by manufacturing a drop of water in the laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So what is the easiest way to see the Supreme Being with our own eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to take advice from the Supreme. The Supreme says, "If you want to know Me..." <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to take the way of the Supreme. "Simply by devotional service one can understand Me, what I am actually, is." You have to take this way. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We are teaching everyone this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogam</span> so that one can understand the Supreme and submit to Him, yes. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one understands by acquiring knowledge after many, many births, then he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the first-class <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> That we are teaching. It is not a sentiment. Most scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is it possible for poverty-stricken people, those who have to earn bread and money by the sweat of their brow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> poverty is no impediment for understanding God. Because we see practically that those who are great souls, they have voluntarily accepted poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Just like Pratapudro(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many. Just like Vyāsadeva. There is no comparison of his literature. One cannot write one line like him. But he was living in a cottage. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, such a great politician, he was living in a cottage. He did not keep any Rolls Royce car or like that. Rather, this material opulence is impediment to understand God. So it is not that I say, comparatively inferior, not that material opulence is also another check, no. Neither poverty is check nor material opulence is check. Anyone can understand if he follows the principle or process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Process as laid down in <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the ABCD. Then you can go further on. If you read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, there is everything explained, everything. All problems are solved. Any problem you propose, there is solution in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now this poverty, as you raised this question, poverty, so what is written there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā? Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is instruction, that "You produce food grain." Now, suppose Calcutta is a big city. Who is producing food grain? Everyone is trying to purchase food grain. But who is thinking that "Wherefrom the food grain will come?" Just see the foolishness of the people. You have to produce food grain. And there is ample facility. But throughout the whole world there are hundreds and thousands of cities. Now, who is producing food grain? The solution is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He said, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> Kṛṣṇa never said, "By motor tire <span class="Italic">bhavanti bhūtāni." Bhavanti</span> means flourish. Everyone is engaged in producing motor tire, car, and they are flattering the Arabians for petrol. The same energy, if it would have been engaged in producing food grain, then where is the poverty? (Someone enters) Oh! Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> These men have just come from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Says something in Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A new <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> New issue, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Speaks in Bengali)</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> So what is this nonsense <span class="Italic">para-upakāra,</span> creating an atom bomb? Is that <span class="Italic">para-upakāra?</span> Of course, it has got its utilization, but it is not for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> is the <span class="Italic">cātur</span> division, that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Cātur-varnyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now in India mostly they are <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> 99.9. They are not interested that <span class="Italic">satya śamo damas titikṣa arjavaḥ, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma svabhāva-jam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Bengali) They are captivated by the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> This, during the British period the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> activities, developing the country by railway, by factory, by bridge-these people are innocent. They thought that "Oh, here is the actual civilization. The Britishers have brought." They lost their own civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is it possible to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> for all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Suppose everyone becomes head. Then where is this supply of hands and legs? We do not say that everyone become brain. The brain is ordering, and who will carry the order? The order-carrier must be there, but they must carry order of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then it will be all right. The brain must be there, and the legs must be there. The legs must move by the dictation of the brain. Then it is perfect. It is not expected also that everyone will become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> Everyone has got his particular qualities. So we have to utilize-what quality does he belong? But at the present moment the difficulty is that they do not care that in the society there must be a class of brain, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That they do not know. They want everyone should become a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> the Communists life, worker, "Work." And therefore they have not been successful. The whole nation is worker, and who will give the brain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The whole nation is worker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Communist country, they want simply worker. But still, they have to create manager. Why manager created? Let everyone become worker. Now, Communist country also, although they say worker, but why they are creating manager?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, you are in need of manager. You are in need of manager. You cannot deny another class of men of manager, so why not make the best manager, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who is truthful, who is equal, <span class="Italic">satya śamaḥ damaḥ,</span> who is control of his senses, <span class="Italic">satya śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣa,</span> who is tolerant? These are the brahminical qualification. <span class="Italic">Satya śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣa.</span> Who is simple, not hypocrite. Everyone is hypocrite. So why there should not be a class who is not hypocrite? All politicians saying something in the mouth and doing something else, because they are <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So this is very scientific. How it not be scientific? It is spoken by God. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varnyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Required. Just like in this institution, I am guru, and if everyone becomes guru, then who will carry out the order of guru? There must be disciple also, who will carry out the order of guru. So it is not required... Just like in your body, it is not that body is made of head only, but head is required. You cannot avoid head, neither you can avoid the leg. So <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> required, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> required, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> required, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> required. And the society should be very nicely managed. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ.</span> Why does He not say one <span class="Italic">varṇa, brāhmaṇa?</span> Naturally there must be division because all men are not of the same quality. You cannot expect. So whatever quality he has got, utilize that. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍha-khañja-nyāya. Aṇḍha-khañja-nyāya.</span> The one man is lame, and one man is blind. So both are useless. So they combine together. The lame man was taken on the shoulder of the blind man. So the lame man has no leg, but he has got eyes. He was directing, "Go this way." So both their business was perfect. Similarly, according to the quality of the work, there must be a class of men less intelligent. They cannot independently work. They must require a master. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> And then the <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> then the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> and the upper man is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He gives the direction to the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> He is ruler.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, (Bengali) ...really classless society. They should not be proud that "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" No. As you are required, as much, the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is also required. It is not that only the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are required. This is a very scientific movement. (Bengali) It is not a bogus sentimental thing. It is a very scientific movement. It is not so-called yogi and swami and everything equal. And where is equality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is a scientific movement?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali) to realize the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Realize the Supreme, that is the first and foremost aim, but at the same time, to keep the whole human society in perfect happiness, according to the direction of God. Just like I told you that Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> If you want to keep the living entities, both men and animal, you must arrange for their nice fooding. Who can deny this philosophy? But they are saying that poverty should be removed, and we must acquire food for the suffering and starving. But what they are doing? They are manufacturing motor tire, the rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) There is no question of <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> First of all we say they must live. That is our proposal. Where is the question of <span class="Italic">dharma? Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Give everyone to eat sufficiently. This is our proposal.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Where is the actual attempt to give everyone sufficient food? Where is that attempt? And here in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is plainly said, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni: [Bg. </span>3.14] if you want to keep happy the animals and the men, then produce food grain. Who is doing that? They simply passing resolution and raising funds and then eating, themself, at the cost of others. And therefore the price is increasing. One who has got money, he can pay more price, artificial. I am poor man. I have no money. You have got money. You purchase before me. Then I starve. But if there is sufficient supply of food grain, then this thing will not happen. You can distribute without any price. That was being done in India. Educated man means unemployment, is it not? So-called education means creating unemployment. They will go with application, "Give me some clerical post, some this post, that post, that post." This is education.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> If you don't take advice from Kṛṣṇa, God, then you are a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> So how he will adjust things? He himself is a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> A <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> means rascal, ass. Therefore our conclusion is that anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious or God conscious, he is a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> He does not know anything. He will not be able to do anything. Therefore this matter was entrusted to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> to give direction. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> means <span class="Italic">brahma jānatīti brāhmaṇaḥ:</span> "One who knows the Supreme, he is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" And he takes advice and gives others direction. (Bengali) Why do they go to the <span class="Italic">bhaṭṭācārya?</span> And he knows what is the action and reaction. That was the system of the society. (Bengali) Nobody is interested. They are simply interested in politics.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) If you want to act as lawyer, you must learn. You must have legal education. (to devotees:) So you take your bath and <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Wherefrom you are coming?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actual flight time was twenty-three hours, but with the time change, about thirty-six hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were in the, thirty-six hours in the plane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we were in the plane about twenty-four hours.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian plane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, an Air India. We came, altogether, ninety-six devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where are they? They have gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are in Māyāpur. They have gone. They have been met by a big bus, three buses, and are going on to Māyāpur.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Where is Gargamuni?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Srutakirti:</span> He's outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Call him, call him. (Bengali) So? Nobody came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, we sent three notices. But five of them are coming to Māyāpur. They called up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. (Bengali) You have got any written statement of our mission?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Mission activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I gave him a <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> and the BBT about your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have already supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I gave him one copy of <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> and that BBT... You have it there? And the BBT catalogue which gives your history and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And catalogue? Where is? This is BBT?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. This tells about your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) ...movement, (Bengali) bogus religious, it is scientific. You can question; I will understand. [break] They do not know what is the meaning of life. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Another blind leader, so-called leader, he is blind himself. He does not know how to lead people. And the followers, followers are also blind. So what will be the result? They are bound up... Suppose if I tightly wrap your eyes, and all of them are done so, then how you will lead them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Blind leaders and blind followers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are controlled by the laws of material nature, and they want to be happy independently. This is rascaldom. If I am controlling you and you want to become happy independently, how it is possible? You must get out of the control first of all. Your eyes should be open. Then you can do something independently. But you are under my control fully, and I have wrapped up your eyes with very thick layer of cloth, and then how you can become independent, work. That they do not know. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, daivī hy eṣā guṇa-mayī mama māyā duratyayā [Bg. </span>7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> this energy, is very, very strong. You cannot get out of it. Then what is the way? <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is so important. If one becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, then immediately he gets out of the control of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is the sign. Otherwise, if I remain a blind man, how can I lead others? Caitanya Mahāprabhu therefore said, <span class="Italic">janma sārthaka kari kāra para-upakāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are very busy doing good to others, but first of all make your life perfect. And otherwise, you rascal, fool, blind, what you will do? So where is the training? Where the politicians are going to take training how to become free from the wrapping, illusion? So they are in illusion, in darkness. What they can do? Futile attempt. Therefore all plans are failure. So many Hitler, so many Gandhi, so many Churchill, they came and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Without being Kṛṣṇa conscious, everyone is blind. Yes, everyone is blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Without being...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Being Kṛṣṇa conscious, everyone is blind. And they are trying to lead other blind men. So what will be the result? All of them will fall down on the ditch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And they attempt to lead others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blind men. Therefore this fact is summarized in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the words,</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuri-bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because they have denied the existence of God, therefore they are blind and they are engaged in sinful activities without knowing what is going to happen next in his life. Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascal. And <span class="Italic">narādhamāḥ. Narādhamāḥ</span> means lowest of the mankind, because in the human form of life one could understand what is God, but he is misusing his intelligence for something else, <span class="Italic">narādhamāḥ.</span> But if you say, "They are educated. They have got so much education. Why do you condemn them?" then the answer is <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> This so-called knowledge they have acquired, that means <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has made them more foolish. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says,</div>
<div class="Verse">jaḍa-vidyā sab, māyāra vaibhava,<br class="calibre2"/>jībake karaye gāḍhā</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He has said like that, that so far advancement of material education means that so-called educated man is becoming more, more, more an ass. Why?</div>
<div class="Verse">anitya soṁsāre, moha janamiyā,</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He is simply getting more attached to this material world, where he will not be allowed to stay. This is his foolishness. Naturally, we are sitting in this room, and if we say that "I can spare only two minutes," then will you be very much eager to decorate the room? So that warning is already there. Everyone knows that "I will not be able to stay here," and they are making skyscraper building. How foolish they are. He knows that "I will not be allowed to stay here," and he is busy whole life how to make fogscraper, skyscraper. The same example. If I say, "You cannot sit here more than few minutes," then will you be engaged how to decorate this room? You'll know naturally that "I am here for two minutes. Why shall I take, waste my time to decorate?" They are doing that actually. So are they not foolish? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Verse">anitya soṁsāre, moha janamiyā,<br class="calibre2"/>jībake karaye gāḍhā</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Unnecessary attachment. Next life he may be not even a human being. The skyscraper building he is doing now with so great labor and enthusiasm, and next life he may be a cat or rat in that building. How can you stop it? The nature's law will act. If you have behaved like cats and dogs and you have attachment for the building, then nature will, "All right, you become a cat and dog according to <span class="Italic">karma</span> and you remain in this building."
