<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is quoted from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Quoted from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, Śrīmad Bhāgavatam,</span> 1.10.11.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> First Canto, Tenth Chapter, Eleventh Verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make note there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have become freed from bad materialistic association can never avoid hearing the glories of the Lord even though they have heard them only once."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So this will protect you from the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Read that again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Sanskrit or translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The intelligent, who have understood the Supreme Lord in association with pure devotees and have become freed..."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "In association with pure devotees." So if you are <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> then where is the..., What is the value of this association? <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga. Sat-saṅga</span> means assembly, discussion. <span class="Italic">Bodhayantaḥ parasparam, tuṣyanti ca ramanti ca.</span> If you are not interested in association, discussion, then you are finished. So... <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are fools and rascals. When you have got this center, it is not that you should be engaged from morning till you go to bed for sense gratification. That is not life. That is <span class="Italic">karmī's</span> life. You have no time for <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> for association. You cannot make any progress by this sort of <span class="Italic">karmī's</span> life. We have to work for organization, but not that whole day and night engaged and no <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> That is a misguided policy, and it will spoil the whole structure. In Los Angeles, they regularly assemble during <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and class. If this regulative principle is lost, then you are <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> They must come back by six o'clock, suspending all other duties, and assemble by seven o'clock. Joint mess program is not good. "You bring some money, you bring some money and spend us jointly for eating, sleeping." That is called joint mess. You know the joint mess? This word? What is that, meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, it means... I thought it had something to do with civil servants, where they all live in a dormitory and eat in a large hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And they all contribute...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...part of their salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you make that association, that will not help you. Joint mess, dormitory. Or joint family. Just like in India. There are five brothers. They're earning. Father and mother is the leader. They're handing over the money, and the father, mother managing. That is Indian system, a joint family. So joint family or joint mess, the same thing. So if you make like that, a center, then it is no good. You must get spiritual strength. <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> strength will not help you. What they are doing in Babar(?) Road, these girls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> They're preparing some <span class="Italic">śṛṅgāra</span> for Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not here? Why go to Babar Road, spend twenty rupees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> According to them, that sometimes they have to go in the center of town.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody has intelligence. It will not, it will not stay. It will be spoiled. Joint mess organization. In Los Angeles, they're also doing business. They're going to sell books. But regulative principle is observed. Huge expenditure they have got. No center is so improved as Los Angeles. We have purchased six houses. And I wanted immediately two lakhs, immediately sent. You cannot pay. You simply want to take. In India, nobody can pay. If I want two lakhs, nobody can pay. But all this money have been taken from U.S.A. I asked Bali Mardana, I asked Karandhara. They paid me for this Bombay affair, sixteen, eighteen lakhs. [break] ...and breathing also does not stop. It goes very slow. Therefore he cannot be immortal. And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> proposes, that is wonderful thing, if you can stop death. And whole spiritual life means how to stop death. That is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata's</span> instruction, "Don't accept guru, don't accept father, don't accept, or don't be father, don't be mother, don't be, if you cannot stop death." Either you don't accept, or don't become. Just like they want guru. So don't accept a guru who cannot stop your death. And from guru's side, it is advised, "Don't become guru if you cannot stop the death of your disciple." This is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam's</span> statement. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to stop death, live eternally with Kṛṣṇa, go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our movement. So our guru gives us this opportunity, no more death. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā...</span> After leaving this body, you don't accept any more material body. And if you don't accept material body, then there is no death. As soon as your spiritual, you remain in spiritual body, there is no death. There is no birth also. Death is concomitant where birth is there. If the death is stopped, then there is no birth. And if there is no birth, there is no disease, there is no old age. This is the process. So birth, death, old age, disease can be stopped only by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So if you don't like to be Kṛṣṇa conscious then what is the use of becoming your disciple, and if the guru, if he cannot stop your death, birth and death, then what is your becoming guru? <span class="Italic">So 'mṛtatvāya kalpate. Yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete puruṣaṁ puruṣarṣabha.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ hi na vyathayanty ete.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Y-a-m?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, y-a-m. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ hi...</span> Get this light on. [break] ...there is birth and death and old age and... That is liberation. That is <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> That is perfection. These rascals are making plans, material plans. Jawaharlal Nehru made plan of this New Delhi. But he is kicked out. "Go out!" And now he has become a dog in Switzerland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> In Sweden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Sweden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He's one of two dogs in Sweden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śrīdhara Mahārāja told me. Some astrologer has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's taken his birth there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they, these so-called leaders are so fools that they... Therefore they don't believe in next life. Because that is very horrible for them. But the next life is there. Just like we, we, we have our next life. We had our previous life, then now another life, another life. So this simple thing they cannot understand. Nature is controlling this, next life, next life. Otherwise why so many varieties of life? So they have no brain. They are simply making plan for the fifty years duration of life. That's all. And even from practical point of view, suppose you are constructing a very nice house, and if you know that next day you'll be kicked out, you'll die, will you do that? But it is a fact. Next day or two days after, you'll die. That's a fact. So first of all, make arrangement that you'll not die, you'll be able to live here. That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Sometimes they take refuge in the idea that: "My family will live on," or "My species..." or "my..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "...children..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...all right. The family will live on not forever. They'll live also, say, for few days. Just we go sometimes in... Just like in England, the castles are there, very old castle, thousand years, two thousand... Even this Westminster Abbey and palace, but which king has lived for there permanently? And now, if you know more, if the king has, by his work, become something else. Not necessarily he'll become a king in that house. He may become a dog there. This science they do not know. And they are proud of their education, culture. Suppose we are constructing the Vṛndāvana temple or Bombay temple. It is also certain we shall not live, but our attempt to construct that temple will be recorded in Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Because he has spent his energy for My service." That will be our gain. Others, they, whatever they are working... <span class="Italic">Ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Ko vā. Ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.</span> This is in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Verse">tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer<br class="calibre2"/>bhajann apakvo 'tha patet tato yadi<br class="calibre2"/>yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.17]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ hareḥ.</span> Just like many of our disciples, as a matter of civilized man they should have remained at home, obedient to the parents, get married and live peacefully with father and mother. Of course, European, American boys, they do not do that. But it is expected that should be like that. Just like yourself. You should have lived with your father. He also. But you did not do this. So take it for granted, out of sentiment, you took to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā sva-dharmam.</span> To live family life, peaceful life, obedient life to the fathers and mothers, this is called <span class="Italic">sva-dharma.</span> So one gives up this <span class="Italic">sva-dharma, tyaktvā sva-dharmam,</span> and takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness gone... Not many, a few. So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">yatra kva vābhadram abhūd amuṣya kim:</span> "What is the wrong there?" Even if he has fallen down, half-way, still there is no wrong. He has gained something. That much service which he has already given to Kṛṣṇa, that is recorded. That is recorded. That is to his credit: "So this living entity has given service." But other men, he's very honestly living as a good citizen, as a good family member and good <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> good <span class="Italic">kṣatriya... </span>So <span class="Italic">ko vārtha āpto 'bhajatāṁ sva-dharmataḥ.</span> He's sticking to his own principle of life, but he's not a Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee. Then what is his gain? He'll simply take the fruits of his material activities and he'll have to accept another body according to that. But here, as it is assured in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">,</span> this man, who took by sentiment Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but could not follow it to the end; by some way or other, he has fallen but he'll be given chance to take birth as a human being, guaranteed, in rich family, or in nice devotee family, yogi family or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. So he'll be given chance. But that man will take only the reaction of his activities. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if he has acted like cats and dogs, he'll get the cats and dogs. But here it is guaranteed, here it is guaranteed that he's going to get another human body and very nice family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Does that guarantee that he'll become a devotee again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he had already practiced. So if he, if he remembers, if he's intelligent, that "I've got this nice position, according to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> because I had some good devotional activities in my past life. Now let me finish. I'll not fall down. I have no economic problem. I have got so much facilities. So let me advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness." If he gets this... He'll get that sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He automatically gets that standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So he must come back to that point again, starting there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you have given. Your children are given the good chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ah yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Sarasvatī's given chance. Now he's, from very childhood, she's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's criticizing: "Mālatī, this old man is smoking." He's getting the <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> from the childhood, as we got it from good father. Yes. So here is a chance. And that will not... It is not childish, Sarasvatī's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In London, she would finish sixteen rounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six. She was... Just see. She has got determination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all the children. So that will not go in vain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never go in vain. This is her... She had executed devotional service in her past life. Therefore from the very beginning of her life, she's in association of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, very beginning. This is the chance. Now it is the duty of the father and mother, and when she grows up it is her duty to finish this business, go to back to home. This is chance. So where is the loss? Even she failed last life, then where is the loss? She's getting another chance, whereas the ordinary <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they'll not get that chance. That is explained. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> One who has forsaken his material occupation to engage in the devotional service of the Lord may sometimes fall down while in an immature stage, yet there is no danger of his being unsuccessful. On the other hand, a nondevotee, though fully engaged in occupational duties, does not gain anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the translation. Purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> "Purport: As far as the duties of mankind are concerned. There are innumerable duties. Every man is duty-bound, not only to his parents, family members, society, country, humanity, other living beings, the demigods, etc., but also to the great philosophers, poets, scientists etc. It is enjoined in the scriptures that one can relinquish all such duties and surrender unto the service of the Lord. So if one does so and becomes successful in the discharge of his devotional service unto the Lord, it is well and good. But it so happens sometimes that one surrenders himself unto the service of the Lord by some temporary sentiment and in the long run, due to so many other reasons, he falls down from the path of service by undesirable association. There are so many instances of this in the histories. Bharata Mahārāja was obliged to take his birth as a stag due to his intimate attachment to a stag. He thought of this stag when he died. As such, in the next birth he became a stag, although he did not forget the incidents of his previous birth. Similarly Citraketu also fell down due to his offense..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we forbid to take to the <span class="Italic">karmī's</span> life. Because at the time of death, if he remains a <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> then he'll have to take birth as a <span class="Italic">karmī.</span> That is the risk. So this regulated life, holding class, chanting, that will not make us fall down. That is essential. It is essential, regulate, to follow the regulative principles, chanting sixteen rounds, holding class. You can do anything, but this will keep us alive to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness platform. If you neglect that, then that is very risky. Even if you get next life birth in a rich man's family, that is not guarantee. Because generally, rich man's sons, they go astray. They get money for nothing and they want to squander it. And material world, if you have got money, so many bad associates will come and help you to squander your money and spoil your life. Because you have got money, then so many friends will come. As soon as you have no money, nobody will come. Even your wife, children will not come. Therefore <span class="Italic">hariṣye tad dhanaṁ śanaiḥ.</span> Kṛṣṇa, first of all, takes away the money, makes him poor so that everyone will neglect him, and because he's Kṛṣṇa conscious, he'll take Kṛṣṇa, "Sir, I have no other alternative. Please give me protection." That is also another Kṛṣṇa's policy, special favor, that "This man wanted Me. Now he's going astray. All right. That's all right. Take everything of his..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Like that man Patrick. Three businesses failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That was my case also. Since my Guru Mahārāja ordered me that "You do this." But I thought that "Let me become first of all rich man. Then I shall do," so He... Every business was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Maybe that is my case also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is special favor. In the beginning I was thinking, "Now my godbrothers, they have taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> They are begging from door to door. Why shall I beg? Let me earn money and start Kṛṣṇa consciousness." But that never happened. So I had to... I was obliged to take the dress of my godbrothers and preach, instead of earning money. Yes. Some astrologer told me that I should have been a man like a Birla. And I got all those chances in the chemical line, to become... Now I am bigger than Birla. That's all right. But even in business field, there were signs that in money things... I got so many good chances. But everything... Dr. Karttika Candra Bose he appreciated my activities, "Very intelligent boy." He certified to my father-in-law. This is the way of becoming rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Why didn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something happened, and everything was finished. That is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Just like something has happened wonderful. So that is also Kṛṣṇa's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> People stopped purchasing...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> People stopped purchasing...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like Dr. Bose's laboratory. So Dr. Bose's laboratory, I was manager. Then I took his agency, very good terms. I was earning money like anything. But the next manager, he became envious. He began to poison Dr. Bose, to cut off our relationship. So it happened. Then, when I was Dr. Bose's agent, I become so much famous that Bengal Chemical, the biggest chemical factory, he, they wanted to give me the agency. If I would have taken that agency, I would have been the richest man in the chemical world. You see. But they made some condition. So I did not accept it. I wanted in my condition. That is the very little... But I was puffed-up, that "I am such a big... And this man is flattering. So I must get my condition fulfilled." So I did not accept it. The Smith Stanstreet gave me agency. Because in my work, in Dr. Bose's laboratory, I did it very creditably. So every other manufacturers, they became attracted to me, how to get me. The Smith Stanstreet Company, Bikepala(?) Company, Bose's, Bengal Chemical Company, they all wanted me. And I thought, "Oh, everyone wants me." So, so I refused. And later on there was a clique between Dr. Bose and me. So I lost everything. Then I started my own laboratory. Somehow or other, there was something, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In Bombay, you were having your own business then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Manufacturing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, that is small manufacturing. So I got very, very good chance. But Kṛṣṇa did not allow it. He wanted me to come to this point. That is my practical experience. And now I'm seeing that it is Kṛṣṇa's so much favor. You see? <span class="Italic">Yasyāham, anugṛhnāmi...</span> It is, it is, actually it is His grace. "What he'll do by becoming Birla, rich man like Birla?" That was Kṛṣṇa's plan. "Come here. Do this work." You see. My Guru Mahārāja ordered. Kṛṣṇa wanted. I was resisting Him. That's all. I was actually very expert businessman in chemical line. I did it very creditably in Bose's laboratory as manager and my own business. And everyone knows... Even in manufacturing also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, with that same experience now you've organized a world-wide society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And that's a big business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Difficult work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just like before coming to India, in Japan, with simply five thousand dollars, you took fifty thousand dollars worth of merchandise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And you brought it, had it sent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And then everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Life members...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And then you devised the program for distributing them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, practically India's, our, whatever we have got, it is starting with that five thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Five thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But it's like you were investing, taking goods on credit, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this membership became successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Then you devised the method for distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This membership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Even the way you went to America in the beginning. You couldn't take money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So you had some books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some books. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Publish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That intelligence gives me, Kṛṣṇa, "You do this." <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam.</span> Yes. And in my materialistic life, He was taking away my intelligence. Just like this Bose, Bengal Chemical agency, I should have accepted immediately. Such a big concern. Simply by sitting, I would have brought ten thousand rupees per month in those days. But there was no good intelligence. I thought, "No, I cannot accept your terms. You must accept..." Because I was at that time young man, puffed-up, no brain, no sober brain. They were so attracted with me. They would have given later on all facilities, but I did not accept. Similarly, Smith Stanstreet, they were also very good company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Smith's...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Smith Stanstreet, an English company. They gave me an agency. So some of my enemy... He was my, he was my employer, but he gave information that I am also manufacturing now, drug and chemical works. So they informed them that "He's pushing his own goods, not your goods." They... He wanted that agency. Yes. In this way, because as soon as you come in the... Even in the spiritual field, my godbrothers are envious. You see? So as soon as you become successful, there will be many enemies. That is natural. That is the sign of success. In your business, if there are many enemies, competitor, that means you are successful. So anyway, Kṛṣṇa has brought me to the right path. So I may not fall down. That's all. (laughter) When I was reading this verse, that <span class="Italic">yasyāham anugṛhnāmi hariṣye tad dhanaṁ śanaiḥ [SB </span>10.88.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> Kṛṣṇa said that "When I show somebody My special favor, I take away all his money," I became shuddered, "So Kṛṣṇa will take my all money? If He's..." And actually that happened. He took my all money, all family, all friends and everything. (laughs) And He asked me, "Go to America. You'll get many money, much money, many friends. You go ahead, Come here." Yes. That was His intention. And I was sticking to limited money, limited friends, limited society. This is special favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So in Bombay you mentioned that Lilavati Munshi... There was one house...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...and you were trying to get that house...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and she took away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...and you were prevented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She took away. Because I was trying to organize a League of Devotees from that house, and Kṛṣṇa wanted, "What is this nonsense? You are stick here, in Jhansi? You come here, in open field." That was Kṛṣṇa's intent. But I thought that "Even Kṛṣṇa took away this?" This Lilavati Munshi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Now her institution is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But my intention was to start this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was simply planning in different way. Therefore Kṛṣṇa's favor. I never deviated from this plan. Since I heard it from my Guru Mahārāja, I've simply planning how to do it successfully. But I thought at that time, that "I'll be able to do it if I get some money. Let me do some business for the time." That I was thinking. But Kṛṣṇa said, "Even if you are pauper, you try; you'll get everything." But I thought, "Without money, how this can be done?" That was difference of opinion with Kṛṣṇa, argument. And I was dreaming also, Guru Mahārāja, asking me, "Come on." So I was going. So I was, "Oh, I have to go? I have to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?"</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You, you dreaming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Guru Mahārāja said, "Come, come with me." I was going. But that... Many things happened before this. Yes. And at last it became, in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Did you tell everyone you were leaving, or you simply disappeared?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I never said. Oh, why shall I? I lost all friends, money, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> I met one gentleman from Allahabad... (Apparently someone comes in)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Get this light. [break] ...to this point, and you have joined. Do it nicely. It is the greatest movement for making the whole human civilization happy. Take it seriously. Don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is Mister S. Domi(?) Singh, he's a... (end)</div>
