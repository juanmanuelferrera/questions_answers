<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I spoke about this cosmic manifestation, where is Vaikuṇṭha, where is... This is a church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Second Church of Christ Scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Was it a Catholic church or..., where you went?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Library Party said that everywhere they go in India, they find that you went there first with your first three volumes of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> Especially in New Delhi, they said. There's one institute which had fifty sets of your original first canto, so now they ordered fifty complete sets to complete the books they had. They said that all the major colleges had your original <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> in India, first edition. So then they could understand that you were distributing books yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They became very enlivened, inspired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> beg, but I did not beg. I sold my <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> books. I got income tax free...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You always gave literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Universalist church. You always gave literature in return for donations you received.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Knowledge..., what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It says "Truth, knowledge, vision."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> State of New York Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is this gentleman on the horse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's one of the former presidents, Theodore Roosevelt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This road is very infamous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Very infamous?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, means notorious. They say that black men, they capture white women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, I've seen it. When I was very young I saw it. I was playing in the park, because I lived next to Central Park, and this, these... We were playing with my friend and his sister, and this black man jumped and grabbed her and raped her right in Central Park. I was only about six years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what was the age of the girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About twelve. So I have personal experience. Especially in the upper part of this park, about Eighty, Ninetieth, Hundredth Street, there it's very dangerous. Where we are on Fifty-ninth street, it's not very dangerous. And on the east side down here it's not that dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see these black men living in such a highly rich country, and civilized men, but their nature is not changed. <span class="Italic">Angara satatau tena(?),</span> but they can be changed only in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No other way. <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā...</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Fifty-ninth Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a good location. This building is for sale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is that Vedic <span class="Italic">om</span> or something like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think so. It says "<span class="Italic">Om</span> eternal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">om</span> word is used in English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Om</span> is very popular in English language for a long time. When they think of mystical things, they think of <span class="Italic">om.</span> The English, originally because they were in India, they thought to imitate some Indian words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many Indian words have been introduced in dictionary. And many English words is also introduced. That is natural. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> ...introduced <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> in the Western world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was in the dictionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But many people had never heard it before you brought it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also the dictionary definition is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The first time I heard <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> was from Allen Ginsberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He went to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> And he learned it from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Generally in the dictionary they say Kṛṣṇa is one of the Hindu trilogy, gods. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">moha janmani.</span>(?) This world is <span class="Italic">anitya</span>; you cannot stay here. That is sure, and still we are attached. We make so many arrangements...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, a man sees that his father has died-everyone is dying-why does he believe that he will not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the wonderful thing. <span class="Italic">Kim āścaryam ataḥ param.</span> Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja said. He was asked, "What is the most wonderful thing in this world?" So he replied, "This is the most wonderful thing, that everyone sees that everyone is dying, he's thinking 'I shall not die.' This is the most wonderful thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But the hedonists, they say that "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you will die."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he knows that he'll die, but still he does not prepare, because he's foolish. <span class="Italic">Pramattaḥ tasya līlānāṁ paśyann api na paśyati. Pramattaḥ,</span> mad, crazy. He sees that everyone dies, "I am also dying," but he does not know what is after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He does not know what to do to prepare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is ignorance. So this education, this civilization is so dangerous that everyone is kept in the darkness. And when he dies, this everything is finished, he's going to accept. Whatever body nature gives him, he has to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes people criticize us that we are talking too much about death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are not fool like you. Because as sure as death. But you are so fool you do not think of it. So we are not rascal like you. This is the difference. We take practical reality, but you are such a fool you don't care for the reality. So we are not so fool like you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But even though you are making so many arrangements to prepare yourself, still you have to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. I'll die, but I am... Just like one has to go somewhere, he'll know everyone has to go. Man..., suppose a building has to be dismantled. So the tenants or the residents, they make arrangement "Where shall I go next?" And the foolish rascal, he doesn't care. And when the times comes for dismantling the house, he becomes busy, oh, he does not know. That is the difference between you and me. I know this house is to be dismantled, so I'm making preparation where to go and stay. But you are such a fool, you are thinking that we'll stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> It's like on the ship they have a drill in case the ship is going to sink, so you know where to go. But they make no preparation where to go after death, which is certain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is dog's life-the dog does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They are two-legged dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there's a popular philosophy now that actually the dog is happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, ignorance is bliss. It is folly to be wise. Fool's paradise. Anyone, like a child is happy. There is danger, but child does not care for it. But therefore it is called foolish. That is the difference between child and the child's father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They may say that he is happy, but he may kill himself at any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say it is impossible for any man to know what will happen to him after death. It is not possible, so why think about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But after all, there is death. So why you are afraid of death? Why you do not die peacefully? Why you protest against death? Huh? If I want to kill you, will you peacefully die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you scream? Why don't you want to die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Give up my life, my body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are so much attached to live? That is the question. Now die, "I'm dying, let me die." Why you protest? That means your nature is that you shall live. But you are being interrupted by death. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The doctors say they have seen death, and it looks very much like a very peaceful sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> My mother told me this. She was a nurse, and she's seen many people die, and they all look very peaceful when they die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody dies peacefully. (laughs) They shall cry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have described it very vividly in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> how horrible it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen one of our relatives, she's dying, and his (her) second son, she's calling, "My dear such and such, I give you in charge, I could not do." Like that. And died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> She was attached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is attached. I have seen one of my nephews, young man. So his young wife and children, when he was... He began to strike his head like that, that "I am dying without any provision for my wife."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is his future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Future means he'll have to come back again, either in the same family or in the dog's family, dog's life. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this way, he'll take birth and die. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> You were saying they take rest for seven months and wake up a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe dog or maybe somebody else; that doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the last, about three years ago or so, there is a new branch of study, it is called biomedical ethics, that deals with the symptom of death: How can one define when a person dies? What are the symptoms? and How can we judge that this man is dead? It is a great controversy in medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They went to the Supreme Court to question when does death occur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what Supreme Court will decide? (laughter) What you nonsense judge know? He's also as good a rascal as the person who put the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Actually they admitted that they could not decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The argument is that by medicine or by injecting some, inserting some apparatus, some machine, they can keep the heart beating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You rascal, he's another rascal. And one who believes in it, he's also a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was reading the other day that at one university they started a course where they take the students through a course of death. They study death and then they try to get them to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it was possible to keep them by medicine, then no rich men would have died. You have got sufficient means to pay for medicine, and he would have kept his relatives, son alive. <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau nṛsiṁha nārtasya cāgadam udanvati majjato nauḥ.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja has said. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are very hopeful that modern medicine can keep them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are hopeful of everything. That is their foolishness. Hope against hope, that's all. The hope will never be fulfilled, still... Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">pramatta. Pramatta</span> means mad, crazy. Their hopefulness means that is a proof that crazy, mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Some of the rich men, they buy a cabinet that their body is put into, and they hope that they will wake up in a thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, hope there must be, otherwise how they are foolish? This is called..., what is called? <span class="Italic">Bakāṇḍo nyāya. Baka,</span> the duck, and <span class="Italic">aṇḍa,</span> the testicle. So the bull, he has a testicle hanging, and the <span class="Italic">baka</span> is thinking it is a fish. (laughter) So he's going, he's... (laughter). This is called <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍo nyāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone knows, this is a common thing in India. You'll see, the <span class="Italic">baka</span> is going on. He's hoping, "This fish will drop and..." (laughter) Therefore they are <span class="Italic">baka. Bokā</span> means rascal, <span class="Italic">bokā</span> means rascal. In India we say any fool, <span class="Italic">bokā</span> or <span class="Italic">baka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Baka</span> is a duck?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means that the duck is a fool. <span class="Italic">Bakāṇḍo nyāya.</span> Very appropriate, this <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍo nyāya.</span> Logic of duck and testicle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You say they are ghostly haunted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ghostly haunted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone, the materialistic man means ghostly haunted. He's talking so many nonsense. The whole grade, philosophy, science and everything, all ghostly talking, that's all. There is no reality. Just like the new science you said, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That new medical science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Biomedical ethics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A big name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it's a nice name. They started with theology also now, in the speculative branch of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in spite of these big, big names and research and everything, man will die. This is <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍo nyāya.</span> He's thinking it will drop. It will never be possible, but they're thinking that by these big, big names we shall find out the way that man will not die. This is <span class="Italic">bakāṇḍo nyāya.</span> Hope against hope. So by that method they want to live? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No. They want to decide when to turn off the machine that is keeping the heart beating, because sometimes the brain stops functioning. The person..., the body is still alive, but there's no consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The coma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also they cut out the hearts when they do these heart transplants. They've been accused of taking out the heart of a living person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The doctors have been accused of taking out the hearts of living persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So how to use it? What they'll use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes if a man is in critical condition he will donate his bodily organs, so they will kill him just to take out his heart so that they can use it for transplanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> When his brain stops, even though the heart is beating, they take it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? (pause) That is the question put by Sanātana Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Ke āmi, kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya.</span> "I want to live, but what is that force that does not allow me to live?" This is the question, this is the question. They are trying to find out so many laws, so many, what is the purpose? They want to live, but there is a force that will not allow you to live. That is the human question. When this question arises, then he is human being; otherwise he's a dog. Dog never inquires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has no control over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has no control over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither he can understand, he has no intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Today is the disappearance day of Sanātana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is also <span class="Italic">guru-pūrṇimā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: :</span>Yes. Is there some special celebration or significance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Guru-pūjā,</span> that you are doing daily. (reads sign) "Model sailboat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the children come here, not only children but adults, and they have some model, toy models which they sail around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is not very deep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. It's a very colorful display. Hundreds of people come, especially on Sundays, sailing their boats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? In this biomedical science, this ethics, there's a problem arising. The person, the family of the person who is suffering, says that "Please don't apply these machines. Let the person die." But the medical doctors say "No, we'll keep him alive as long as we can go on." So this is a problem. So who's right? Is the family right, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Family right. Family is intelligent, that "You are rascal, why you are trying? Let him die peacefully."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say "Let him die in dignity. Why keep him in the machine?" The family says "Let him die in dignity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They keep him in coma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, you cannot protect. Why you give trouble at the time of death? You cannot protect; your foolish attempt will not help him. This is the same philosophy, that the animal is suffering, to kill him. Mercy of killing, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Mercy killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is nonsense. Mercy killing. Killing mercy. (laughs) Just see. The action is killing, and that is his mercy. This is their mercy. All contradictory. Killing by mercy? Mercy is killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's an example that's just going up to the courts now. There's one family, their daughter was being supported by one machine, so one day they went in early and pulled out the plugs. So now they are being taken to court. They stopped the machine because she'd been in a coma for so long, so they just pulled out the plugs and everything, the machine. So that's what they call mercy killing. They don't like the doctors just to keep them there uselessly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But then they want to kill the old people. This mercy killing, they think that "An old man is suffering, so let us kill him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think if someone dies in their sleep, they are very lucky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is dangerous to die here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not as dangerous as in Africa. I saw one movie, and there's one tribe, that when a man becomes very old...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I've heard of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They throw him on the roof, and then eat him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Love feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grandfather feast. Now great-grandfather feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> We're preaching to them, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Trying to change them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Also the Eskimos, when a man gets old, if he is an Eskimo, then he has to go out into the icelands and wait for some animal to kill him. He cannot stay at home and be supported by the family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He eats too much, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Too much burden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Because he's eating, and he is not able to go and hunt, they send them out to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Communists also, they'll do. All old men should be killed. That time is coming. Don't become old. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are teaching us to remain young forever, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> One must become Kṛṣṇa conscious to become young.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many difficulties will come unless there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> if you want to be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's true. If people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, then the origin(?) of these problems like death...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You are instructing us to finish up our business in this life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b></div>

<div class="Purp-para">Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja was put into so many dangerous conditions. He was not afraid. "Hare Kṛṣṇa," he would just chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> All over the entire world we find the Indian community, practically speaking. Is this part of Lord Caitanya's plan to help spread this Vedic culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order, that you speak the Vedic culture. That is India's mission. But these rascals, they are speaking technology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Try to make money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that it is due to this culture that India has been kept down. Because the British taught them that, and now they themselves think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, any Indian who comes to speak about some culture like this, you flock together. Why? Why you go to this Maharishi, this Bal Yogi, and this one. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you expect something from India. They are cheating, that is different thing, but you go there to get something from India. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means you have delivered the real goods, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. They're expecting. I read some articles from India: they're expecting some good message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They are like glowworms, and you are like the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they know that "These people they are wanting something, so let us go and cheat." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They're simply businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I am concerned, I have not come here to cheat you nor to gain. I've come to execute the order of my Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no business to cheat you neither to get something from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, is it possible that a living entity, a <span class="Italic">jīva</span> soul, can have pastimes in relation to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If it's nonsense...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's a crazy boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> One who is to come from India, he should come for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra,</span> for doing welfare to others, not to cheat them. But these people, they come. In the name of <span class="Italic">para-upakāra,</span> they cheat. Which way we have to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> This way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Prabhupāda, you are the only Indian who has taken up this mission, out of six hundred and eighty million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Don't touch that dog. He's wearing a muzzle. Just leave him alone, he won't trouble you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What she said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> She said don't touch the dog, it's wearing a muzzle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> She should wear a muzzle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...come with dog. Dog is not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's her family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> That's her family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Sometimes they say "I treat my dog just like he were my own child."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Dog's mother." Why don't you call in one word, "I am dog's mother." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They keep all kinds of things as pets. My mother knew a woman who kept a pet pig. She used to carry it around like a dog, in her arms, with a little bow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the natural tendency is to get child, but child is killed, and a pig is taken. This is their civilization. Child is killed and pig is taken, dog is taken. This is their civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They are preparing for their next birth as a pig.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Naturally you take child, take it: "No, that kill." And take artificially a pig or dog or cat. Take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> They say animal has no soul, therefore they can kill the cow and eat the meat. But when we say "What if I cut your dog's head off," they become very upset.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> Why upset? It has no soul. Kill it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They cannot explain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was one story that this family came, they were touring the world, and they came to Hong Kong, and they were carrying their pet dog with them also. So they went to one restaurant and they left their dog tied up on a leash outside the restaurant, because that is the custom in America. So they told the man at the door, the doorman, they pointed to the dog, just to take care of the dog. So anyway, then they went in and they had their dinner and they came out, and the dog was gone. They said (laughter) "Where's my dog?" And the man said, "Well, you pointed to him, we have prepared him for you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they do that. He thought that he has pointed out this dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They brought their dinner with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Man cannot understand, but a little child can understand very easily. Just like one of our book distributors, Praghoṣa, when he was a young child they had a pet duck, the family, and one day the father killed the duck and put him on the table. They roasted the duck and put him on the table, but none of the children would eat. They became sick and they left. They would not eat. The father could not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> My father did that with a pet rabbit that I had as well. Came home from school one day and it was gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are eating their own child...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, we come from the lowest of the low. (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the possibility of opening more than one temple in this city? Just like if there's a good building on the East Side, if we can manage, what about the possibility of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can manage, very good. In a city like New York you can have ten, twelve centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I mean the Christians have so many churches in every part of the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Similarly, we can have temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You said that once in Los Angeles to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Juhu temple, Akasganga, you know? Everyone asked me not to go there, "Nobody will go there." I said "It is Bombay city. Wherever you shall go, people will come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The question is whether, if we open another temple, it will increase the total number of people coming, or whether simply the same people will come to two different locations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you have got demand, then you can open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> First let us fill up this place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other words, instead of filling up that building and then just buying a new one, you just buy a second temple. And keep it that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a good building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We shouldn't give it up. Very good facility. Especially once we make all improvements on it, why we should give it up? Better to simply open another one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is advertised means nobody's purchasing at this quarter, it is not very safe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This quarter? No, this is the most prestigious. Fifth Avenue between Seventy-ninth Street and Thirty-fourth Street is the prime location. That's about as far north as you would want to go. Any further north uptown will not be nice, but this area here is very select. The best area is from Fifty-ninth Street to Thirty-fourth Street on Fifth Avenue, where all the shops are, the library. That area is very high class. This is Fifty-seventh Street, Fifty-fifth Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, if the spiritual master has a mission, is it proper for the disciple to think that he can take more than one..., he can take many births to help the mission of the spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the spiritual master goes there, somewhere, his nearest assistants, they automatically go there to assist him. When Kṛṣṇa comes the demigods also come to help Him. That is there in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> All these Yadus, Yadu family, they came from heaven. So before Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, by some trick they were all killed and they returned to their original place. It is nicely described in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Just see, small house, this yellow. Still, in New York City.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, small little house. (end)</div>
