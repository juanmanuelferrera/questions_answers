<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...detached to that, Jain. So he was advertising about that Jain Muni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Susil Kumar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Susil Kumar. He went to San Francisco. He met me there. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So he has come back, so I inquired what is the result of his preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> All glories to Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that he has converted one million persons to be vegetarian. So vegetarian, automatically our disciples, they are automatically vegetarian. There is no separate preaching. And what about the... He was talking about the <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span> And I told that vegetarian does not mean <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span> should be practiced by... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">ahastāni sa-hastānām apadāni catuṣ-padām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Phalgūni tatra mahatām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Phalgūni tatra mahatām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">phalgūni mahatāṁ tatra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahatāṁ tatra jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> This is natural, that one <span class="Italic">jīva</span> is the food for another <span class="Italic">jīva.</span> So how <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span> is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That has been said in <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> by that Matan(?) Muni, you know, Matan Muni who was harboring Saubhari, and then he was killing one elephant and living on the elephant for one year, and all other <span class="Italic">ṛṣis</span> were against him. He was, I mean, not practicing <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span> Then he gave the feast to all those <span class="Italic">ṛṣis,</span> and the <span class="Italic">lāḍu</span> starting moving about. Everywhere there is life, I mean, every grain of the wheat or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore how it is possible? Because, after all, apart from Matan(?) Muni, if this is the rule, that one living entity is the food for another living entity... This is the law of nature. <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> You cannot starve and live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And practically... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are killing the body and not... The soul is inkillable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Don't go to the philosophy. First of all come to the practical. (Dr. Patel laughs) Come to the practical point of view, that after all, you have to eat; otherwise you cannot live. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam.</span> So if you have to live another living entity, then how you can practice this <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span>? Mean on the basic principle, the <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā paramo dharma,</span> where is <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span>? You have to kill. Either you kill vegetable or animal, you have to kill. Then where is the standing of <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span>? That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When you kill purposelessly, without any useful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No interpretation. They say that "no killing." So no killing is not possible. That is my point. Then where is the thesis stands, that "We are for not, no killing"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Every action, sir, is, I mean, entangled in this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then our Vaiṣṇava's philosophy is perfect, because we take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> We don't say vegetables. We are not advocating vegetarianism. We are advocating that "You take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" How perfect it is. We are not so nonsense that "Because we have become vegetarian, we are perfect." The goats are vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughter) And we are indirectly vegetarians if we eat goats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Even if we vegetarian are, then how you become big? The goats are vegetarian. Huh? <span class="Italic">Apadāni catuṣ-padām.</span> This vegetable is meant for the <span class="Italic">catuṣ-padām,</span> for the animals, four-legged animals. If somebody says that "Why shall I take this vegetable? It is meant for the animals. I shall take the animal." That is a good argument. Yes. So to become vegetarian is not <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span> at all. It is a bogus theory. To become a devotee and take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> that is perfect. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So automatically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He does not say, "Give me a, I mean, a (Hindi)."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That. Then there is perfection, if you take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam. Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajāyate.</span> So this vegetarianism is no good position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, the Jains have, I mean, pushed the vegetarians to a very, I mean, to an extent which is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is the benefit? The benefit? The goats are vegetarian. Eh? There are so many animals. They are vegetarian. The monkeys are vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are perfect vegetarian. Perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they live in the forest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But number-one rogue. Each of them keeping one dozen women, at least, and no discrimination between wife or daughter. No discrimination. Just like hogs. That's all. No discrimination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Cows are also vegetarians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatī-nandana:</span> Cows, they are also vegetarians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cows are vegetarian. That's all right. There are many animals, vegetarian. So there is no perfection of life unless we come to the point of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Simply by becoming vegetarian, simply by becoming nonviolent, simply by... These are all theories only. It has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The argument is sometimes put forward that not everyone will be able to embrace Kṛṣṇa consciousness fully. Therefore it may be better for them to accept some portion, like, for example, taking up vegetarianism or even doing <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga,</span> or something like this is better than nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not very essential. Essential is how to think of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> He doesn't say that you become vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That said, <span class="Italic">tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara:</span> "You must do everything for Him, even eating."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is vegetarianism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, then you are... Then automatically he'll become vegetarian. Automatically he'll become vegetarian. If he takes Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then he is vegetarian automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it may seem like these other things are stepping-stones to Kṛṣṇa, but is it necessarily so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No stepping-stone. This is the ultimate, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">,</span> these four things. Unless you come to this point, there is no question of perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. Then you feel that every action of yours is done for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not feel, but actually it's an order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Actually doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arjuna did not feel; he took order to kill. Not that you manufacture your idea. No. That is not. You take order directly and then do it; otherwise you'll be responsible. Therefore the guru is required to act as representative of Kṛṣṇa. If he says, "Yes, it is all right," then it is all right. Otherwise not. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> Otherwise why guru is required? We must take every moment order from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ya bhakti...</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kathitā.</span> You cannot manufacture some ideas that "I am feeling I am doing for Kṛṣṇa." No. That will not be... Direct order. She is going behind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Today is a full moon day, and the full tide came at twelve o'clock by night. So after eight o'clock there is a full reverse of it, what do you call it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Low tide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Low tide. Yes. (Hindi to passerby)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Garuḍa. He is perfect vegetarian. You know what is his food? Snakes. (Dr. Patel laughs) And he is carrying the Lord. It is a devotee, you see? He is not vegetarian. And how powerful he is that one sparrow, a small bird, lost his egg. The <span class="Italic">samudra</span> took it away. And he decided, "I shall dry this <span class="Italic">samudra.</span>" So he began to pick up some water. So Nārada Muni was passing. So he asked, "What you are doing?" And "Sir, yes, the <span class="Italic">samudra</span> has taken my egg, so I shall dry it up." So he said, "But how you can do it? You are so small. You just pray to your head. You are bird, and he is the head of the birds. You just pray to Garuḍa. He can do it." So he prayed Garuḍa, and Garuḍa came and asked <span class="Italic">samudra,</span> "Immediately deliver; otherwise I shall take step." Immediately it was delivered. Such powerful. Yes. And he was not a vegetarian. (Hindi with Dr. Patel) You become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is the... (Hindi with Dr. Patel) (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you very much. <span class="Italic">Namaskāra. Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Real culture is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. (Hindi)...no illicit sex, no gambling, automatically. <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samā...</span> If you simply turn these people to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all good qualities will come automatically. All good qualities. That is wanted. And we are practically seeing that. Simply by becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, lover of Kṛṣṇa, they are becoming qualified. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no good qualification for a nondevotee. He'll simply act on mental speculation, that's all. It has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes people are amazed that we've given up such sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they should be amazed, because they are mental speculators.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean unconditional surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And here are the surrendered souls. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">api cet sudurācāro.</span> "Even they have got some bad symptoms," <span class="Italic">bhajate mām ananya-bhāk,</span> "but if he is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious," <span class="Italic">sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> "he is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>" So if we want to make the whole world <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> perfect human being, then we have to push on this movement without any hesitation. All people will be <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> and then there will be peace and prosperity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean bring about the spiritual communism of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real com... Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. They are stating, "Everything belongs to the state." Why you are limiting? State is limited. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Then it is perfect communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Bible it says, "On earth as it is in heaven," that the life on earth should be also under the domain of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there is no program how to actually do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, program is there. Kṛṣṇa is speaking, "Do this program, execute," <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad...</span> Program is there, but rascal will not take it. There is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Christian prayers are also the self-surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any prayer. If we become God conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is all right. And without God consciousness there is no qualification. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> There cannot be any good qualities. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then His kingdom can come on earth, not otherwise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If one man becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, he can deliver many millions. Not expected... You cannot expect all to become, but if one man is there, Kṛṣṇa conscious, he can deliver. [break] <span class="Italic">Kaścid yatati siddhaye, yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścid... [Bg. 7.3].</span> So it is not so easy thing, but if there is one Kṛṣṇa conscious person, he can deliver many millions. [break] ...<span class="Italic">ti śreṣṭhas ...lokas tad anuvartate.</span> There must be one <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha,</span> ideal man, and then everyone will follow. And there is no <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha.</span> That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Śreṣṭha</span> is only God. <span class="Italic">Śrī iṣṭha</span> means <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha,</span> sir. The <span class="Italic">śrī iṣṭha</span> is only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha,</span> but one who follows Him, he is also <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ [SB </span>5.5.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "By associating with devotees..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgī-saṅgam. Tamo-dvāram,</span> the path of darkness, if they associate with <span class="Italic">yoṣitāṁ saṅgī-saṅgam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga sadācāraṁ nirāvinam.</span>(?)These three qualities come to men, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga</span> means you have to associate with <span class="Italic">sat,</span> devotees. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you associate with <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> then you'll gradually relish Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Just like Nārada Muni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, anyone. Anyone. It is open to everyone. So therefore we are trying to open centers, all parts of the world, to give them chance of <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> so that gradually they will become perfect. And that is happening actually. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never said that you find out some first-class men. No. He said, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa.</span> It is not necessary that you have to find out some qualified person. Anyone. Simply instruct him what Kṛṣṇa has said, that's all. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha.</span> There is no question of selecting. Why selection? All are fallen. The so-called gentleman, he is also fallen.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All of them are <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They, all of them, all the three (indistinct) also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he may say that "I have passed B.A., M.A., Ph.D., D.H.C.," and "Whether you are Kṛṣṇa conscious?" "No, sir." "Then you are a fool, rascal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) The B.A., M.A., are <span class="Italic">māyā</span> degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This preaching is done by Śyāmasundara's little daughter, five years, six years. She goes to a gentleman, "Do you know Kṛṣṇa?" So he says, "No, I do not know." "The Supreme Personality of Godhead." Just see. This is preaching. A child can do this preaching work. She has learned from us, and she is convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and she goes to anyone, "Do you know who is Kṛṣṇa?" He says, "No, I do not know." "The Supreme Personality." This is preaching. Then he is a good preacher. That's all. The rascal does not know Kṛṣṇa. He gets at least some information, "Here is Kṛṣṇa." And on this basis our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara, Ph.D.... You have read that book? It is first class. The scientist, so-called scientist, unless he is insane, he cannot say that there is no God. He has written so nice, from scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the real scientists are also God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right. He is real scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have been unfortunately against them, but think of Albert Einstein. He was totally God conscious throughout his life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is all right, but mostly they say, "What is the use of God? Now science, everything science." They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have been very harsh to the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are misleading. These rascals are misleading. That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was very God conscious when he made the atomic bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How many of us are scientists here? He might help you also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We know real scientist because we know the biggest scientist, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are scientists. Without Him we don't claim to be scientists-fools, rascals. <span class="Italic">Ārādhito yadi haris tapasā tathā kim.</span> He is everything. He doesn't require to. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa, then you become scientist, philosopher. And I was never a scientist, so we challenge the scientists, and I have produced this scientist to challenge them. But I was never a scientist. That book is actually revolutionary amongst the scientists. <span class="Italic">Scientific Basis,</span> you have read that?</div>
