<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. I think this gentleman would like to have some interview with Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like to translate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (translated) ...great spiritual master, kindly present yourself to the listeners to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have already explained what is our mission, what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Already I have explained to some extent and if he wants some particular answer he can ask me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He would like to know who you are, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and how old you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am now seventy-seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (translated) For how long are you at the head of this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the last five years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> Can you please describe the dress in which you are clothed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can ask about some philosophy. Dress, (how) people will benefit knowing about my dress. Instead of wasting time in that way, I can ask you why you are in dress... That's not very important thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Anyone can answer those questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> What do you think of the future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Of the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Future you can guess... (indistinct) ...taking and it is spread all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's asking about your childhood, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's like to know something about your childhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was (indistinct) ...a devotee (indistinct) ...my childhood. My father was a devotee and he trained me....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> Are you happy? (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think? What do you think? I'm happy or unhappy? (indistinct microphone is faulty) ...this wrong conception should be... (indistinct) We should know our real identity. Then everything will be all right. We are going on in the wrong concept of life. Therefore people are not happy. So (indistinct) ...spiritual master... (indistinct) If people accept... (indistinct) They'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> (indistinct) ...history of many masters and many great teachers such as Jesus Christ and many others... (indistinct) ...come to... (indistinct) ...message. (indistinct) ...today on the same level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because from God's side there is always an attempt to make the people right. As soon as they're wrongly directed, some messenger comes like Jesus Christ or Buddha or, before Him, Lord Kṛṣṇa. So what we are preaching that is not new. It is God consciousness. And all the great messiahs they came. But the thing is that people are changing in their different education mentalities. So we have to present things in such a way that intelligent person can accept the old teachings in the western countries. Like Lord Jesus Christ... Either they're not being followed or they're not properly understood because in London I saw hundreds of churches are vacant. That means that it's so practical that people have no more interest in Christianity or the Christian people could not convince them of the spiritual necessity of life. Many churches are for sale. That's not a good sign. That means people have lost interest in spiritual life but fortunately the younger generation, they are taking to this spiritual movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He asks: Lord Jesus Christ, when he came, brought a message of hope, peace and confidence, not only in this life but also the future life, life after death. He asks if Your Divine Grace would like to speak about (indistinct) your speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are giving a message by which everyone can be happy in this life and next life also. Generally all religious sects they do not believe in the next life. Or even they believe they have no clear idea of the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> What is the present hope of the human society even beyond death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Human society is... Human life is an opportunity to stop all the problems of material life. So if he does not do so, if he does not understand or take to this business how to solve all the problems of life, then he's missing the opportunity. We are giving very nice idea what is next life, how we can elevate to the topmost spiritual planet, how we can live eternally, peacefully, with full knowledge. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is for all these purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> In society, the consumer society, (indistinct) miseries, what is the message you can bring people even in this day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By accepting this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement they will be moralists, they will be religionists, they will be first-class (indistinct), first-class politician, everything perfect by accepting Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> We have heard from not such a great master who has (indistinct) ...highest spiritual principles, (indistinct) ...like socialism and spiritual communism, he'd like to know exactly what this means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual communism means that these so-called communists they are concerned with the limited thing. Just like the communists in Russia or China, they are thinking of their country main only. They are not thinking of others. Or they're thinking only they human beings, not of the animals. But our spiritual comm... Communist means that we take care, not only of the human being, but of the animals also. We don't think that the human being is only our own community. We think every living is within the community, center being God. Just like spiritual our communism means... Just like I'm living in this house. I shall have to take care even for one lizard, that is also living entity. I shall have to take care of one rat, one mouse, even one snake, if he's living in one's house. That is spiritual community. The idea is nobody should starve. I have to see whether the leader is also given proper food. Just like people generally save foodstuff from the attack of other animals. But spiritual communism... [break] We ought to make them happy. We want to see everyone is happy. That is our mission. Actually all our students who are presently working with us they are feeling happiness... (indistinct) So everyone will be happy if they take to this movement. We want to see that everyone is happy. That is our mission. We don't want to exploit others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He asks specifically, in the Christian society (indistinct) already has a culture of... (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...that's (indistinct) culture. Nobody's actually Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...he wants to know when you elect someone into a social office... (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our Vedic civilization that their life should be (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...how a man such as yourself, in such a high position and such hierarchy was able to leave all this in order to bring this message to others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It's not to be... Life is divided into four parts: <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> student, <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> householder, <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> retired life and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>. Everyone should follow this principle. First of all, as <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> student he should learn sufficiently what is the value of life. Then, when he's a householder, he should live properly with husband, wife and children-properly. Then, after retired life, giving the responsibility of household life to grown-up children, he should take lessons from saintly persons. (indistinct) Then at the end he should take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Whatever knowledge he has gathered he must distribute by traveling from one place to another. This is Vedic civilization. Everyone should come out. Not that they should remain at home and drink and sleep for the whole life. This is Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Do you think, in a world so much caught up in material way of things... (indistinct) ...be able to penetrate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is penetrating. Just like here in France, in your country, how these young men they are taking part unless it is penetrating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He says thank you very, very much. (indistinct) ...very much trouble before meeting you... (indistinct) Thank you very much for the few minutes you've afforded to us. (indistinct) ...for a long journey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Frenchman:</span> <span class="Italic">Merci.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (end)</div>
