<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kali-yuga. Take little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Kali-yuga means this age. Kali-yuga means the age of quarrel and disagreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Age of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quarrel and disagreement. Because there is no standard idea, so I'll disagree with you, you'll disagree with me, and on slight provocation there will be fight. This is the age called Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you see that nations will fight too? That there will be wars, things like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many difficulties. Even there is no war, the natural disturbance and foolish government will create such situation that people will become mad in hopelessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Very dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very dark, yes. First thing, there will be no rainfall. Due to the sinful activities of the people, from nature the punishment will be, there will be no rainfall. I have seen already in Europe. Everywhere there is scarcity of rainfall. And on account of scarcity of rainfall, food production will be reduced. They will try to eat meat, killing, and maintain themselves. But that is also not very prospective. How long you will...? The animals will also die. Then in Europe they are doing that, that on account of scarcity of rain there is no grass, so they are thinking, "These animals die for want of food. Let us eat them." This is their intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Well, do you see that many people will die because there's not... Many people will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If there is no rainfall, either animal or men, they will die for want of food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> What do you think would be the remedy or solution to the problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Remedy is they should admit that there is God. But they do not admit, especially the so-called scientist rascals and atheist philosophers, politicians. They do not accept the authority of God. They think they will be able to manage things in their own way. And they say clearly, "There is no God." But there is nature. You can say, "I don't care for the government but the government force is there; police is there; military is there. Similarly, you may say, "Defy the control of government," but the agent of God is there, the material nature. That will punish you. There will be no rain, there will be no food production, and the rascal governments will take advantage of it, "food relief." They'll tax, as if by taxing they will be able to combat with nature. So three things we'll have to meet: no rain, no food, and government taxes. Then how people will remain in sane condition? They will become mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> But your teaching, doesn't it offer a way of meeting these problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are teaching people God consciousness. Then everything will be solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> You say that man does not understand nature. The scientist studies nature but yet he doesn't really understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they do not understand it? Why don't you understand that there is control over us? Where is the difficulty? Foolishly we do not try to understand. Do you admit it, that above us there is control? Do you admit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Some people do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why others? That means they are foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes. Well, each person has his own thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that means... He may be rascal, but it is a fact there is control over us. Just like if there is no rain, is it not control over you? Can you produce rain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I would say that there is a universal intelligence guiding everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that means control. How can you deny the control over you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> What do you understand is man's place in nature? Should he invent, let's say, electricity? Should he invent machines? Do you think these are good or should he just leave those alone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, these are good or bad. Suppose if there was no, this comfortable pad. That does not mean that I cannot sit. If there was no electricity, it does not mean we would have died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was lamp. We were doing that. So we don't condemn electricity, but it does not mean because we have got electricity, we shall deny the authority of God. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. You might have improved from the oil lamp to electricity. That does not mean that you have the control over God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes, certainly not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these foolish rascals, because they have improved little, they are denying, "Oh, now there is no need of God. That is opiate." What is that? Opiate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Opiate of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They make the man foolish, God consciousness," and so on, so on. These scientists, they declare, "What is God? This is all superstition."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> But in the world there seem to be many different religions, many different faiths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion you may have. Religion means to try to understand God. Any religion-you take Christian religion or Hindu religion or Mohammedan religion-there is little attempt to understand God. So any religion which gives you knowledge of God and you understand what is relation with God, that is perfect religion. We have no quarrel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think if all men, let's say, all the religions could try to come together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion means to understand God and to follow God's order. That is religion. Just like government and government law. So if the citizen understands what is the law of the government and abides by it, then he's a good citizen. Similarly, any person who understands God and abides by the order of God, then he is religious. Why do you stand? You may be Christian; I may be Hindu; he may be Mohammedan. It doesn't matter. Everyone should understand God and the relationship with God and act accordingly. Then it is perfect religion. And if there is no conception of God, no carrying out order of the God, that is not religion. That is cheating. But generally they do not accept God-still, he is stamping himself that "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian." He has no idea what is God, how to abide by His order, and they are fighting that "I am Christian and you are Hindu. Therefore we must fight." This is going on. Nobody understands what is God. Pseudo religion. Practically there is no religion. If there is no government-you make your law; I make my law-then how there will be peace? That is the position. They do not understand what is God, and "I am Christian" or "Hindu" or "Mohammedan, so let us fight." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think that there is a special way that Hinduism looks upon man's place in the universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Hindu religion is a vague term. It is a vague term. It is not clear. It is not clear. Real term is, it is called, Vedic principle. Vedic principle. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said: Vedic knowledge means to understand God. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So anyone who tries to understand God, he is in the Vedic line. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge, so as you get the stock of knowledge, that is called <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> But as soon as we say <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they think it is Hindu. Mathematics is a science. So any scientific man will accept mathematics. Where is the question of Hindu mathematics? Gold is gold. If it is in the hand of Hindu, it is Hindu gold? Hindu, Muslim gold? Gold is gold. When we give the Vedic knowledge, they think it is Hindu idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Are you saying that this knowledge has appeared in many forms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Does it appear also in, let's say, Christianity, in Muslim, Mohammedanism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I say that every religion, there is an attempt to understand God. Why do they not understand God, what is God? Then everything will be solved. But they are decrying, "There is no God. God is dead," and "There is no need of God, now we have got science." In every step they are trying to kill God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> That's true of certain people, but there are also many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Majority, they do not understand what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> There are many sincere seekers, I think, in Christians and Moslems. At least I have met.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That must be. There must be some sincere men. That can be admitted. But still the sincere man also does not understand clearly what is the meaning of God. "I believe in God." "I believe in God," they say. Just like in America they say, "We trust in God." But what is God, he does not know. So what is the meaning of this, "I trust in God"? That is a phobia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> It probably means many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I say, "What do you mean by God," they cannot give any clear definition. And our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is, "Here is God. Take Him." But they have no knowledge. They will say, "They are presenting some Hindu god," and then they do not accept Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> What do you understand by that word God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God means supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Super?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> The master of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think that this concept is the special insight of the Vedic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You, as a philosopher, you can understand that there is supreme controller. Can you deny it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I would... Only with great difficulty, it seems to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is... You cannot deny. But they foolishly deny it. Therefore they are rascals. So how you can convince the rascals the right way? If you give me a dozen of dogs, can I convince him that what is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Hardly. They have no capacity to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have no capacity. The modern civilization, we are creating dogs and hogs, so how they will understand God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think there will always be a few who understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Unless one... But if there is a class of men, ideal, who understands God, then people will follow. We require one moon. Then the darkness will be dissipated. But if in the millions of stars, what is the use? So they are creating millions of rascals, not one sane man, the modern civilization, the so-called philosophers, so-called scientists. Don't mind. This is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you basically reject the modern civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I say they are being foolishly trained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole education system is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> You see no hope that there will be change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is hope. There is cent percent hope, provided you accept the right way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> But would you say the right way would have to be, let's say, to be a follower of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God means Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> What about...? As I understand, in the <span class="Italic">Gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God... Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. So God must be all-attractive, full controller. Our definition of God is</div>
<div class="Verse">aiśvaryasya samagrasya<br class="calibre2"/>vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva<br class="calibre2"/>sannam iti bhagam itīṅganāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="calibre3">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> 6.5.47)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">All wealth, all power, all intelligence, all beauty, all renunciation. In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> These are new books in French, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> and <span class="Italic">Upadeśāmṛta.</span> This devotee has just brought them from Bhagavān dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Thank you. When you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Two days ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You know French language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes. Yes, I saw a copy earlier today at the... The man who did the translation, I forget his name. He worked on the translation. It's very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes. I forget his name. It's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is French book, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Umāpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes, Umāpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Umāpati. He is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes, I met him this afternoon. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...give the idea of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> To try to teach, to try to help people understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now in India another danger is that so many rascals, they are declaring, "I am God." And this India, people have become so fallen down, they accept all these rascals as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think the same problem is here in India as in other countries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in your country there is no God. That is another problem. There is no God. And here rascals are God. The problem remains the same. You say frankly, "There is no God," but these rascals say, "There is God, but here is my God." And he says, "No, here is my God." No one knows the real God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> How does one distinguish between what is a false God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the formula. Just like <span class="Italic">aiśvaryasya.</span> Now, you have got some money, but you cannot say that "I have got all the money of the world." That you cannot say. You may possess some states, but you cannot say that "I am the owner of all the states." So God is the proprietor. You have got your country. Which country you belong to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> United States. So you have got certain area. But when you go to the seaside, then who is the proprietor of the sea? As philosopher, will you not think it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> There is no proprietor, strictly speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why no proprietor? A small tank if you dig, you immediately claim, "This is my tank," and such a big ocean, and there is no proprietor? As philosopher, how you can think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Well, I think of what is the basis of... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose I go in a park. There is nice tank, reservoir of water, very decorated. And if I think, "There is no proprietor," is it not my foolishness? There must be one proprietor, but I do not know him. That is real sense. Similarly, everything has got proprietor. Why the sea and the land, the so many other things, why there is no proprietor? This is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I don't understand how this relates to distinguishing who are the true teachers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I have already explained. Everyone is foolish now. You cannot distinguish who is thief and who is not thief. (Bengali) If you study everyone you will find everyone is rascal at the present moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> But surely there are some who are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some must be there. There is no doubt about it. But they are so in minority. Who will hear about them? "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." The whole world is rascal. If somebody is intelligent, who cares for him? Just like people laugh at me that I am talking of God. I am not only talking. I am writing so many books. My only endeavor is to understand God, that's all. There is no sectarian. And I am selling my books all over the world. So not that everyone is foolish. They're trying to understand my presentation, big, big scholars, big, big philosophers. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> We have many of them in our library...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So there is knowledge. If people kindly take it everything will be solved. But they have stubbornly denied, "No God." And I am stubbornly fighting, "Yes, there is God." That is the... Now the whole America is combining to fight against me, opposition, that "This man is brainwashing, controlling the mind, and our children are kidnapped." They are bringing these charges against us. Just like you have come. Have I kidnapped you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Oh, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these rascals say that I have kidnapped their children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But judgment has been taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be judgment, but people have become so rascal. So I am trying to convince, although single-handed, that "There is God," and they are bringing opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That is the real philosophy. That is not only Indian philosophy; this is universal philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> God, the almighty powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is not Hindu God, Muslim God, Christian. God is God. Now, when I say, "Here is God. His name is Kṛṣṇa. His father's name is Nanda Mahārāja," now they will laugh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Do you think if a person is to be a real believer in God he has to also worship Kṛṣṇa or speak of Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God means Kṛṣṇa. He has to understand it. Therefore so many books. God has many names, millions, of which Kṛṣṇa name is the most important. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. Then you have to understand the science of God. How Kṛṣṇa is God, that you have to understand. But for that reason we are publishing so many books. We have already published eighty-four books, simply in English language. And they are being translated in German, French, Portuguese, then Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Hindi, Bengali, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> It's a very great effort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we are getting response. Our books are selling like hotcakes. (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> This is about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa, the person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Kṛṣṇa, the person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here it is written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes, the Supreme Personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead." It is written there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes, I saw it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Supreme Personality of Godhead." Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> This is a book of Kṛṣṇa. The complete resume of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tenth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> The person does not want to solve the questions. They want only to get riches. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they don't want simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> And what is the use of becoming rich man? It is all fruitless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rich man you can become but for how long you shall be rich? The nature is so cruel; at any moment he'll take away everything. Then what is the use of becoming? No, you become rich man. There is no... But you should know that "Although I am rich, powerful, everything can be taken by nature at any moment." <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> That is statement of God, that "Any moment... You try to become rich, powerful, and president or minister, that's all right, but any moment, I can take everything from you." So who will protect himself? They have no brain that "Whatever I have created, it can be taken at any moment." So what is that confidence? They have no inquiry even. That this is a fact. Either you become Napoleon, Hitler or Gandhi, or this or that, any moment everything will be taken away. "Get out." Not only that, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> you have to accept another body. And that is no guarantee what body you are going to get because fully under the control of nature. They therefore don't believe in transmigration of the soul. And that is very great botheration. They try to evade. But Kṛṣṇa says, God says, "You cannot evade. It is nature's law." <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Within your body the soul is there. On account of presence of the soul-you were a child; now you are a grown young man-the body has changed. You were a boy; now you are young man. So on account of presence of the soul, the body is changing. So when this body will be finished, the soul will exist. Therefore, naturally you have to conclude, there will be another body.</div>

They're proud that "We have manufactured so many tires, so many wheels." The time will come when there will be no purchaser for tires and wheels, and they'll starve. That is coming. What they will do? If they become hungry there is no food grain. For some time they will eat, killing the cows, and then there will be no food, and what these tire and wheels will do?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I think there is some misunderstanding that many Americans may have about the teaching that you have. Maybe you can clarify it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you clarify it. It is your duty. You are philosopher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Well, that's why I am trying to understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I think it's something like this, that... I've learned it from other of your devotees, or devotees of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got our books. You are philosopher. You can read. You can understand the whole thing. There is no question of "This devotee, that devotee." We are giving in writing. So we cannot deny that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> The question though is that there seems to be an advo..., that you advocate that there be a kind of Vedic society, that you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Vedic means knowledge, intelligent society. Why do you understand Vedic? <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge. <span class="Italic">Vetti veda-vido jñānena.</span> This <span class="Italic">Veda</span> word coming from knowledge. When I say that "Here is a man of knowledge," so what is the objection? Is there any objection? If I say that "Here is Mr. such and such, a man of knowledge," so is there any objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Is there a what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is there any objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Will anybody object?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> It depends on whether the man shows himself to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If I present you that "Here is a man of knowledge," so what is the objection? Everyone welcomes knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Yes, but one has to also show that he has knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is next. First of all, if I say that "Here is a man of knowledge," where is the objection? Now, whether you are man of knowledge, that will be tested next. But if I introduce you that "Here is a man of knowledge..." Similarly if I say, "Here is a man who knows <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span>" so why the objection? Knowledge is for everyone. Why do they take, "Oh, <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> oh, it is Hindu"? Immediately you reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I don't think it's so much a question of rejecting the <span class="Italic">Vedas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> they do not know what is <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> They think it is Hindu. This is the difficulty. As soon as you say, "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>" "Oh, it is Hindu idea."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Well, many, many people do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that means they do not know what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Unnecessarily they put some outside... Just like they are doing now. They do not know what is knowledge, and they are accusing us that we are brainwashing. We are forbidding our devotees, "Don't eat meat." Oh, they are taking it: "It is revolutionary. Eh? How these men, they are stopping?" Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is difficulty. If I say, "Here is a person who knows mathematics," why there should be... Any person who is interested in mathematics will welcome him. So similarly, here is Vedic knowledge. Vedic knowledge means real knowledge. Here is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the knowledge of God, but they misunderstand. They think, "Oh, we have got another God." How God can be another? So people should be sober, that we are giving books. They should understand. And it is accepted by the educated class, big, big professors, big, big philosophers. It is not blind faith. Just like this version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> "As we are changing body even in this duration of life, similarly, when this body is finished, then another body," so where is the difficulty to understand? But they will say, "It is Hindu idea." Fact we are presenting, that "You are changing your body. When you came out of the womb of your mother, the body was so small. And then little bigger body, little bigger body, little bigger body. Now you are full grown young man." So the body is changing, everyone can understand, but I can understand also that "I had so big..., small body and this body." Then body is changing; I am existing. Then where is the difficulty of the transmigration of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Many people do accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But as soon as we say, "Oh, this is Hindu idea"-reject immediately. This is science, and they are taking "Hindu idea."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The problem is that identification only. Otherwise it is universal philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is universal, but they are taking it as Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> In order to identify that, Vedic, let's say Indian, actually that is not Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever it may be. Knowledge is knowledge. It may be Indian or American. It doesn't matter. Just like university. Some student from India go to university in America to study higher knowledge. So that means that because he has gone to America, that is American knowledge. Knowledge is knowledge. So they should take on this background, but they are thinking that we are spoiling their children, brainwashing, controlling the mind, because against their principle, against their uncivilized way of life: meat-eating, illicit sex, intoxication. This is uncivilized life. Why a man, civilized man, shall eat meat? He can prepare so many nice things. He has learned how to produce food, food grains. When they are uncivilized-there is no food; they do not know how to grow food-they can eat animal in the jungle. But if after becoming civilized, if you are eating the same thing, then what is the difference between civilization and not civilization? You have learned. And especially in your America you can get all nice foodstuff. You have got sufficient grains, sufficient fruits, sufficient vegetables, sufficient... Everything sufficient. Why you should eat meat? This is uncivilized life. They could not give up the uncivilized way of life. And when you teach that "You become civilized. Give up this all nonsense. Don't eat." "Oh, it is brainwashing." You see? We are teaching them to become civilized, and they are taking it brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Is that a teaching of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that one should not eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not... Meat-eating is third-class man's eating. It is not denied. <span class="Italic">Amedhya.</span> But to give us our life, don't kill cows, because it gives you milk, very substantial food. If you want to eat meat, you can eat the hogs and dogs. But don't kill the cows. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is special. It is not forbidding meat-eating, but don't eat cows' flesh. That is loss. It is a great loss to the human society. If they do not have sufficient milk production, then their brain will be dull. They will not be able to understand subtle things. Therefore it is better to avoid it. But if you cannot avoid, you can eat some inferior, useless animals. But don't touch the cows. This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> He never says, "Pig <span class="Italic">rakṣya.</span>" You can eat pig. You can eat the goats, the lambs. There are so many small useless animals. They are eating dogs also. The Chinese people, they eat dogs. So you can eat dogs, hogs, so many other animals. But don't touch the cows. This is God's instruction. And they are advertising that "These Hindus, they are so fool, they are worshiping an animal, a cow." They do not know what is the economic value of this cow. In the beginning of your life you want milk immediately in the morning. And you are killing the mother? You are civilized? Do you think? You take milk up to the point of death. In South Africa, before killing the cows, they drag out milk and then send it. Milk is important, but because they are uncivilized, they do this. You take milk. Instead of killing, you prepare so many nice things from milk which is good for brain, good for intelligence. But they do not know because uncivilized. Foolish fourth-class men. So we are trying to bring them to become first-class men, and they are accusing of brainwash. "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." We are teaching that "These boys, they are becoming first-class." Anyone will worship them. How nice they look, how behavior, how their character. We are creating this, and they are accusing, "Oh, they are kidnapping our children." Why you are going? Eh? Why you are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> So this is our position. Now you are philosophers. You try to understand the whole philosophy and combine together. People have become all fourth-class, tenth-class, uncivilized men. They should be given the idea of God consciousness. I don't say only in Western country. Everywhere this is the problem, all fourth-class men. So there is possibility to bring the fourth-class men to the first-class. That is educational. It can be done. There is no difficulty. So this is the education, how to make fourth-class men or fifth-class men to come to the first-class standard. What is that? Which verse I wanted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminates in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, suppose you are a well known philosopher. If you say, "There is God," so many people will hear: "Oh, here is a big philosopher." Therefore your studies of philosophy will be perfect when you establish, "Yes, there is God." Otherwise it is useless because you will waste your time and you'll waste... Already they are Godless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> How does one establish clearly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That requires thinking. That requires knowledge. Therefore we are giving so many books. You can study. You can present the case nicely with argument, philosophy. That is your duty. <span class="Italic">Avicyutaḥ arthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānu...</span> When you are able to describe God very philosophically, scientifically, mathematically, then your education is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Are there any books particularly that focus on all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every... There are so many books. There are so many books. The primary book is the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> yes, as it is, if you take it as it is. If you amend it to your whimsical way, then it is gone. Therefore we are presenting. This word we have added, "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span>" Don't try to amend it. Then it will be foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I wanted to know if <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> you'd have to read Sanskrit, wouldn't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have this English translation. This is in French translation, in German translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> How does one decide... There are so many translations. How does one decide...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on your philosophy. You are reading so many books. How do you select, "This is nice." That depends on your philosophy. But if you accept it that it is spoken by God, then there is no argument. But why should you accept it, spoken by God? You read it, whether how much logical, how much full of knowledge. Then you can say. The same thing. Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> "Within this body there is the soul, and because the soul is there, therefore body is changing." So anyone can... Any layman can understand. Things are there like that. So there is no difficulty. If we take, "Oh, this description, the transmigration of the soul-Hindu idea." Why Hindu idea? It is science. As soon as we consider it "Hindu," then it becomes sectarian. Then you will say, "I have got my Christian idea. Why shall I take your Hindu idea?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> What is your view towards Christianity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christianity is to some extent, but you have got different edition of Christianity. So far I know, as soon as they say, "Christian," immediately the question is, "To which Christian party you belong?" What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Christians, yeah, Protestants, Methodists, Catholics...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So which is correct Christianity we do not know. But we have no such thing. There is no party. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there cannot be any party. If anyone makes any party, he is immediately cancelled. But at least we believe in the Ten Commandments. Now, Lord Jesus Christ said, "Thou shall not kill." But why all the Christians are simply busy in killing? That is my first question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Not all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 99%, they are maintaining all big, big slaughterhouse, all Christians. And Lord Jesus Christ ordered, "Thou shall not kill," but they are killing. What kind of Christian he is? Disobedience to the order of Christ? And still he is Christian? These things are going on. Then again party, this ism, that ism, that ism. First of all, all of them are disobeying the Ten Commandments, and then there are parties. So which one you'll accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> There's no such diversity of interpretation of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, apart from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> I am talking of Christianity. How you can disobey the orders of Christ and you become Christian at the same time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> There's always people falling short of what their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That means they are all useless. If you are Christian, how you can defy the order of Christ? You will disobey the orders of Christ; still you are Christian? Just like in India they are all denying the Vedic culture, and still they are Hindu? All these rascals. So therefore, I say, the whole world is full of rascals. If the Christians accept this word, that Lord says, "Thou shall not kill." Why shall we kill? Welcome. Never mind whether Christian or Hindu. Welcome. Similarly, in India, if they accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> welcome. But everyone is rascal, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Nobody cares for God, nobody cares for God's messenger. All rascals. This is the position. They are creating God. They are creating religion. They are creating sect. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Even though they are sincere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be educated from the very beginning. Therefore we are opening <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> sane brain. Otherwise their brain is spoiled by so-called bad education. I inquired from your state secretary that "You write on the bills, 'In God We Trust,' so why not spread this God consciousness-what is God? You blindly say, 'God in Trust,' but what is God? Do you know? So why not spread this science?" I received no reply up to date. They might have said, "Here is a crazy fellow. Nobody has inquired like this." That's all. They do not like to enter into the controversy. Actually they do not believe in God, but they write, "In God We Trust," is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> That's what they write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but they don't believe in God. Hypocrisy. Because if they trust in God, then they could not cheat that "I am paying you one thousand dollars by some papers." This is cheating. And promise, "In God I Trust." Is that money? So this cheating is begun from the government. Now, how the people will be honest? Everywhere, in all government, they are giving you some papers and you accept it as money. This is not brainwash. Just see. They are educating people that "I promise to pay. This is money," but actually he's receiving some papers. This is not brainwash. And we are talking of God, that is brainwash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Perhaps when people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this is the present situation. When people will be honest, that is future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> But I mean now, when they make these confrontations and give you these difficulties, perhaps it will give your people a chance to teach them and clarify...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that we are doing, but this is the opposition. That our boys are trained up. They are trying to meet the opposition. But my point is that such a nice thing we are giving. Why they should oppose? That means uncivilized. Why good thing should be opposed? They say, "In God We Trust," and we are speaking of God only. We have no other business, and they are opposing. And they write, "In God We Trust." Hypocrisy. "If we believe in God, we trust in God, all right, they are talking of God. Let us hear." That is sense. That Patrick? Patrick? He kidnaps our devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ted Patrick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And by force trying to give him meat. So now, if educated men of your country, they come forward, understand this philosophy, then combined effort... My philosophy is that American and Indian, American money and Indian culture, combine together; the whole world will be changed. That is my philosophy. It is coming to some extent... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> "...International Society for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The two should cooperate. The blind man should carry his lame companion, and the lame man should give guidance to his blind friend. In this way both will benefit. Similarly, the wealthier Western countries should assist the materially exploited East, and the East, particularly India, should help the spiritually blind West to understand scientifically the actual higher purpose of human life. To offer India's transcendental science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the West, Prabhupāda sailed from Bombay to New York City in 1965. After a year of great personal struggle, he established the first center of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness. In the next few years he attracted hundreds of sincere disciples and opened centers in dozens of American and European cities. He also established <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> schools and farming communities based on the ancient Indian patterns. In 1970 Prabhupāda returned to India and with the assistance of many Indian gentleman and some of his disciples, he established ISKCON centers in Bombay, Delhi, Calcutta, Madras, and the rural holy spots of Vṛndāvana, Lord Kṛṣṇa's place, and Māyāpura, West Bengal, the birth place of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Soon he attracted many Indian disciples as well, who opened centers in Hyderabad, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, and in several rural areas. Today ISKCON has about one hundred <span class="Italic">āśramas, gurukula</span> schools, temples and farming communities around the world. But according to Prabhupāda, his books are his most important contribution. In the last ten years he has published over eighty volumes in sixteen languages. Scholars in India and abroad have praised Prabhupāda's books as classics, scholarly and authoritative. Literally crores of his literatures are sold annually, and this figure is almost doubling every year. How is it possible to sell so many books about Kṛṣṇa? Girirāja, president of the ISKCON center in Bombay, answers, 'People all over the world are looking to India for transcendental knowledge. They know that India's ancient Sanskrit literature speaks of lasting happiness beyond the frustration of material life. They are eager to buy our books because they know that we are presenting the genuine Vedic culture. In fact, many Westerners come here to discover the real India for themselves, (indistinct) life experience. For this reason we are building a model Vedic community at our Juhu center in Bombay, providing all the modern amenities for scholars, students, and sophisticated inquirers from abroad as well as from India who can study the original Indian culture and practice. The center will include a Vedic library, theater, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> restaurant, <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> school, an international guesthouse, as well as a temple and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span>' ISKCON is also building a model Vedic community in Māyāpura near Calcutta based on cottage industry and agriculture.

On twenty-five acres of agricultural land in Māyāpura, ISKCON is developing and demonstrating scientific farming procedures such as crop rotation, organic fertilization, and using improved strains. ISKCON is also cross-breeding cattle from Canada and Australia with Indian cows to increase milk production. Thus the community provides (indistinct) daily needs, acts as an agricultural development and demonstration center, and additionally feeds thousands of people twice every week.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> Fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Expecting fifty thousand. The real (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's what we're trying to bring together here in this city. (indistinct-conversation going on) and then all around, the different communities, <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> community, the merchant community (indistinct), their own communities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Kneupper:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> According to the Vedic system (indistinct-more than one person speaking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "(indistinct) which developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By culture of such knowledge the human society can attain perfection of life. This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">śruti</span> therefore directs that those who are actually advanced in should aspire to the service of Lord Viṣṇu. Unfortunately, persons who are enamored by the external beauty of <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā</span> do not understand that the culmination of perfection or self realization depends on Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-māyā</span> means sense enjoyment, which is transient and miserable. Those who are attracted by <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā</span> utilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. Śrī Nārada Muni has explained that all paraphernalia of the cosmic universe is but an emanation of the Lord or His different energies because the Lord has set in motion by His inconceivable energy, actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They have come to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation they merge into Him. Nothing is therefore different from Him, but at the same time the Lord is always is different from them. When advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord the whole process becomes absolute. The Personality of Godhead, His transcendental name, fame, glory, etc., are all nondifferent from Him. Therefore all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, and all the branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc., may be used in glorifying the Lord. The (indistinct), writers, poets, and celebrated literature are generally engaged in writing sensuous subjects, but if they turn (indistinct) the service of the Lord, they can describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Vālmīki was a great poet, and similarly Vyāsadeva is a great writer and both of them have absolutely engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord and by doing so they become immortal. Similarly science and philosophy also should be applied to the service of the Lord. There is no use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. Philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced people are eager to understand the Absolute Truth through the medium of science and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, philosophical speculations should be utilized to establish the Supreme Truth as sentient and all-powerful. Similarly all other branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also the same is affirmed. All knowledge not engaged in the service of the Lord is but nescience. Real utilization of advanced knowledge is to establish the glory of the Lord. And that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged in the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factual <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana,</span> for the glorification of the Lord."</div>
