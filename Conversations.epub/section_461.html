<div class="After-Verse">"Gradually people will become dwarf, will die very soon, mostly unfortunate, eating too much, and very much sexually agitated, no money, and independent, and the women, all unchaste." Just see. Everything's coming true. <span class="Italic">Rājan,</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"The cities will be full of rogues and thieves." Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That's Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere. In Calcutta it was dangerous to go out because the next... You do not know whether you'll come back. People are so afraid. He's going to work in the office. It will be God's grace if he returns back. It is such a city. Actually so happened. We were sitting, I was at that time in a... I was guest in our life member's. Sitting in morning, afternoon, o'clock (?). "Oh, that gentleman is killed." He was very important businessman. He went to the temple, a Marwari, and on his coming back, he was killed from the backside. Life is still so, but it is little diminished. [break] ...about so-called saintly persons, they are: <span class="Italic">tapasvino grāma-vāsāḥ.</span> "The so-called yogis, they'll live in the town." Actually, the yogis have no business in the town. They should go to a secluded place. But they will live in... Just like the other... He's living in Paris City, and he's a yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This is all from the Twelfth Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Foretold, five thousand years ago. Here said, <span class="Italic">tapasvino grāma-vāsā nyāsino 'tyartha-lolupāḥ:</span> "And the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they'll be too much greedy about money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just see.</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Patiṁ tyakṣyanti nirdravyaṁ bhṛtyā apy akhilottamam.</span> "The natural tendency will be to give up, divorce, husband, especially when he has no sufficient money." The wife will divorce. Or the husband has no sex power. The wife... The divorce case takes place in two: when the sex indulgence is not very good, and when the husband has no money. Here it is:</div>
<div class="Verse">vāso 'nna-pāna-śayana-<br class="calibre2"/>vyavāya-snāna-bhūṣaṇaiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>hīnāḥ piśāca-sandarśā<br class="calibre2"/>bhaviṣyanti kalau prajāḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"In the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> the general public, having no residence, <span class="Italic">vāsa,</span>" you see. I was surprised when I saw in the beginning that they are lying down on the street in the Bowery. They have no place. They pay one dollar, and the Lion's... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Salvation Army.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. The Lions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Lion's Club?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lion's Range, or something. They give shelter at night. They pay one dollar and lie down. And morning, they go away. There I have seen many signboards in Bowery Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They call them "Flophouses".</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway. So <span class="Italic">vāsaḥ anna.</span> Food. <span class="Italic">Vāsaḥ anna. Vāsa</span> means residence. <span class="Italic">Anna</span> means food. <span class="Italic">Pāna</span> means drinking, milk or water or whatever. You require something drinking. And <span class="Italic">śayana,</span> sleeping or lying down on bed. <span class="Italic">Vāsa, anna, pāna, śayana,</span> and <span class="Italic">vyavāya,</span> sex. Sex also required. <span class="Italic">Vyavāya, snāna.</span> I have seen in New York. They have no... In a humbug, they have no place for taking bath. They have to go elsewhere. Sometimes some friends come to take bath. The, our students, they were coming to take bath in my bathroom. So <span class="Italic">snāna.</span> So these things, nil. "When these things will be nil," <span class="Italic">vāsa, anna, pāna, śayana, vyavāya, snāna, bhūṣaṇaiḥ,</span> "and dress," <span class="Italic">hīnāḥ,</span> "being devoid of all these things," <span class="Italic">piśāca-sandarśā bhaviṣyanti,</span> "they will be just like, what is called, urchins."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Piśācī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These hippies, they are exactly this. They have no place to sleep, no nothing of the sort and looking like big, big hair. <span class="Italic">Piśācī. Piśāca.</span> What is the English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Ghost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ghost, yes. Ghost, yes. Ghost-like. <span class="Italic">Hīnāḥ piśāca-sandarśā bhaviṣyanti kalau prajāḥ:</span> "In the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> the <span class="Italic">prajāḥ,</span> people in general, devoid of residence and proper food, then proper drinking, resting place or sex or bathing and dress, they'll look like ghost." Then?</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"In the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> for a cent, for the matter of taking a cent only he'll give up his friendship with others. And even his own man, family man, relative, he'll kill him to take that two cent or five cents." <span class="Italic">Na rakṣiṣyanti manujāḥ sthavirau pitarāv api.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The guests are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> There are many guests here to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. "Even they'll not give protection old parents."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> To old parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Old parents. (guests come in) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī (translator):</span> So I'd like to introduce you to these gentlemen and these ladies. He is... He's called Pere Canivez. Pere Canivez, here, and he is the Secretary of the Bishops of France, and he would like to come and discuss with you. Here is the Pere Fransad. He's a Christian priest also who, that I knew and so by his help Pere Canivez came. And he'd like to come with this lady who's come, Madame Siaude. She's living in India usually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you live in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Siaude:</span> Yeah, in the French part of, far eastern state, in Pondicherry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pondicherry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Siaude:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Aurobindo's place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Siaude:</span> Yes, I have been there a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> And she was studying with M. Laconde, this gentleman who came yesterday. She's very much studying Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava</span> philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava</span> philosophy. And we'd like to invite also M. Misraki. He's a compositor of music, but he also wrote book on life after death and many different things. So he was interested to come also. So they all came together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are all nice gentlemen and ladies. It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> And very interesting too, that the first question, one of the first questions that Pere Fransad asked me, was: "Do you believe in love of God, and that God is a person? Some people say that God is not a person, and we say God is a person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So you can translate in French so that they can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least Christians cannot believe in impersonal God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christians, they cannot say that God is impersonal. (French) Because, because Christ is son of God. So the son is person. How the Father can be imperson? And in the Bible it is said, "There was word in the beginning." That is God's word. So if one has a word, then He's a person. Word comes from the tongue and mouth. As soon as there is word, background is tongue and mouth. And then... The Christians pray in the church, "Oh, God, give us our daily bread." So God has got ear so that He will hear and supply. But His personality, His word, His hearing, they're all transcendental, nonmaterial. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he says he agrees on this point. As you say, God is... We have a personal relationship with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, God is person. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> Absolute Truth is realized from three angles of vision, Brahman, Paramātmā and Bhagavān. Bhagavān is person, and Paramātmā, all-pervading, localized, and Brahman, impersonal. Just like the sunshine is impersonal the sun globe, localized, and the sun-god person. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He says he's accepting some of the things you are saying, but he's doesn't think that he's obliged to accept everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. Everything is emanation from God. That is our <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra. Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Whatever things are there... In the Bible, also there is... "Everything comes from Him, what is made." Yesterday, we were reading? Yes. So whatever is created, that is made out of God. And the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma:</span> "Everything is Brahman, the Supreme Brahman." So the impersonal feature is an expansion of God's energy. Just like the sunshine is expansion of the energy of sun, so the sunshine is resting on the bodily rays of the sun-god. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">brahmaṇaḥ ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā.</span> The resting place of the impersonal Brahman is God, Kṛṣṇa. Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">brahmaṇaḥ ahaṁ pratiṣṭhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇaḥ aham...</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham<br class="calibre2"/>amṛtasyāvyayasya ca<br class="calibre2"/>śaśvatasya ca dharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>sukhasyaikāntikasya ca</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I am the basis of the impersonal Brahman, which is the constitutional position of ultimate happiness, and which is immortal, imperishable and eternal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> "The constitution of Brahman..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, oh. You have to explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll get another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In the meantime, we can translate from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He's asking when, how old are the oldest of the Vedic scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He's asking how old are the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> How old are the <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> These Vedic scriptures, we are reading, how are old are they, he's asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are from the creation. <span class="Italic">Tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ<br class="calibre2"/>tene brahma hṛdā ya ādi-kavaye muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ yathā vinimayo yatra tri-sargo 'mṛṣā<br class="calibre2"/>dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.1.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now who will translate? You, one by one, line, the translation you speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> O.K. "I offer my obeisances unto Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vāsudeva, who is the Supreme, All-pervading Personality of Godhead. I meditate upon Him, the transcendent reality, who is the primeval cause of all causes, from whom all manifested universes arise, in whom they dwell, and by whom they are destroyed. I meditate upon that eternally effulgent Lord who is directly and indirectly conscious of all manifestations and yet is beyond them. It is He only who first imparted the Vedic knowledge into the heart of Brahmā."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> "Who is the first created living being."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You read another verse, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Aham ādir hi devānām.</span> (loud noise in background) Never mind, never mind. Don't bother. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Oh, from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā? Aham...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām.</span> In the Bible it is said, "There was word." That is Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānāṁ maharṣīṇāṁ ca sarvaśaḥ:</span> "Neither the hosts of demigods nor the sages know My origin for in every respect, I am the source of the demigods and the sages."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You said also in the Bible it is said, "There is the word."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That word, sound, is the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So before creation, <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> were there. So you cannot find out the history of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> You find out the history where the creation began. Then, before that, <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> were there. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He (the Bishop) says that he finds many things agreeable in this Vedic tradition, but he says that he thinks it might be a mistake to say that the Bible is exactly the same thing as the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He says there are still distinctions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, then, distinction, then it is to be considered which is perfect, the later edition or the original. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> They are saying that according to their understanding, God revealed Himself little by little, and then at certain moment, He revealed Himself in His totality. But in the Vedic literature, there it is said that the whole knowledge was given at the beginning. Everything together. He said that he's very much respecting your research, and that he's asking that we should not say that these two research in Christianism and the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the scriptures, are the same. They are two different things. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, for example, the verse you read yesterday, that was similar to what is taught in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but if we take the rest of that chapter from the Bible, we find some discrepancies, differences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> For example, in that chapter, it also says that the word of God became flesh and that flesh was the son of God, Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that means Jesus Christ is transcendental, not of this material world. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They say... They accept... They think that Lord Jesus, however, was a human being. He was spiritual, but also he was part of this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, material world is part of Jesus Christ, but Jesus Christ is not part of material world. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that they had a human body, he had a material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That human body appears like that, but he had no this material flesh and blood. A material body, how there can be resurrection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If it was material body, how is it possible for him to be resurrected? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> They said it is by the <span class="Italic">acintya</span> power of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These, these rascals, they thought that "Jesus had a material body. Let us kill him." So Jesus Christ bewildered them more, to remain rascal, that they will continue to think that Jesus had a material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> Bewildered them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, he bewildered them more by saying: "All right, go on thinking like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their punishment. They remain always in darkness that Jesus had a material body. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So he's saying that he respects your explanation, but that the Christians, they have another explanation, and that if we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we must come to the reason before giving explanation. You cannot explain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What is the reason for his incarnation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot explain whimsically. You cannot explain whimsically. If Jesus Christ is son of God, he has... That means he has got spiritual body. You...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> Yes, we accept that he got the has got spiritual body, but we say that he assumed also a material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, then, then, another thing is: you accept Jesus Christ the only son of God, is it not? So when you pray in the church, you address God, "Oh Father." Then why "only son"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> We say that the son is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then everyone is son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> Yes, we say that this is the same God, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I address God, "My father," then I am his son. So why there should be "only son"? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> Yes, we say that we are adopted sons. (laughter) (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> They say that they are sons, that all living beings are sons, but by adoption.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Adopted son. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore these sons' body and Jesus's body cannot be equal. So adopted son has got material body, not the real son. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Their idea is that: Yes, of course, Lord Jesus, being the son of God, his body is spiritual, but because he wanted to take part in the life of the human beings on earth, he actually accepted a material body just to live among men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he should accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> But we have a vesper that says that he was died, that he was suffering, and things which show that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But his death... You think that he was died, but he resurrected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> But the gospel says that he had died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> You cannot... We accept the totality of the word, as you accept your word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no. "Died" means that is similar death. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyam [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like Christ take birth from the womb of Mary. It appears like that, but actually that is not. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> No, it is very important that the death of Christ is a real death. For us, it is the center of our faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They say that the central point of their philosophy is that Lord Jesus actually died. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, according to Vedic conception, even ordinary living being, he does not die. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> You understand Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> No, I don't understand it by hearing it. You have to read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na hanyate,</span> does not die, <span class="Italic">hanyamāne śarīre,</span> apparently, the body being dead, the soul is never dead. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So... Shall I explain that one? What the good Pastor-are they called Pastor?-describes is that in order for there to be a dialogue, we have to respect each others' positions, not that we will try to convert the other. He says just as we respect you have an absolute faith in the Vedic philosophy, so also there must be respect that the Christian interpretation of the life of Lord Jesus and his death...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I think I have better respect than him to Jesus Christ. I say he does not die. He says he dies. (French) So far respect is concerned, I have more respect than them. They want to see Jesus Christ dead. I don't want to see him dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> No. Death and resurrection after, Jesus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's a resurrection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Excuse me. Perhaps at this time we can introduce Madame, Madame Devi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So we'd like to introduce Mrs. Devi, who came here also to meet you. She's a very wonderful lady. She's writing a dictionary of mysticism, and she did the whole first part on Western religions, and now she wants to do the following part on the Eastern religions. So she would like very much to talk in this book about ourselves, about the movement of Hare Kṛṣṇa which is a big part of the Oriental religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Recently, there was a historical excavation that Jesus Christ did not die, and he, after crucification, he was taken to Kashmir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Kashmir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Where was this? In a newspaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In paper I saw. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> But we are not under historical literally. We try to speak of mystical experience. This is exactly the subject of, that we did. We cannot discuss history because everybody has his own documentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I was very much pleased because I was very sorry that Jesus Christ was crucified. But when I heard this historical discovery, I was very satisfied. But one thing is that... Here, at least, in London, I have seen. There are so many churches vacant. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says he was at your conference, last night and he was there when you described how human life is meant for knowing God. So now he wishes to ask you a question: What is our process for coming to know God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very simple. It is not at all difficult. Just like in your body, you are, the soul, important active principle... (to Jyotirmayī:) Explain. (French) Similarly, this huge, gigantic, cosmic manifestation must have some active principle. That is God. So where is the difficulty to understand God? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> For example, in our prayers, in our studies, what is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now first of all, let us understand what is God. Then prayer. If you do not understand God, then what you'll prayer? If we understand that there is the active principle, then the prayer we have already described, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ anvayāt itarataś cārtheṣu abhijñaḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "I pray to the Supreme Personality of Godhead Vāsudeva who is the origin of all creation." This is the active principle. There is. So... And how He is working? (To Jyotirmayī:) You have to explain. (French) In the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> I offering the prayer. So the process is that I offer my all respect to the Absolute Truth, Supreme Truth, from whom the creation has taken place, everything is resting, working nicely, and after annihilation, it will go there. And when you study what is the nature of the original source, it is said, <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ,</span> cognizant. He knows everything. Just like I am the owner of this body, I, the soul, but still, I do not know how the body is working. I am eating, but I do not know how my eatables transformed into secretion, then goes to the heart, then... Of course, they have discovered something, but not fully. So I do not know what is going in within my body. I do not know how many hairs are there. But God knows everything, nook and corner of the whole universe. But if we compare ourself with God, that is impossible, because naturally we get knowledge from others, we may question, "Wherefrom God got knowledge?" Therefore it is stated there, <span class="Italic">svarāṭ.</span> He hasn't got to take knowledge from anyone else. He's independently full of knowledge. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That would be impersonal. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the other hand, he imparted knowledge to Brahmā, the first creation of this universe. That knowledge is called Vedic knowledge. That means Vedic knowledge is coming from God. And it is being distributed through Brahmā. And he's so mysterious that even learned scholars become bewildered to understand Him. And this material world, although it is temporary, it appears to be fact on account of energy, being energy of God. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She says that God is known as <span class="Italic">antaryāmī,</span> the witness in the heart. Does that mean that we can have a direct experience of God without going through the scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the practice of yoga. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> I guess if you have the idea of <span class="Italic">prapatti,</span> of surrender...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> ...this is a way to God directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is... That is the real process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> But it is not yoga. It is different from yoga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> <span class="Italic">Prapatti</span> is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prapatti</span> is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Woman:</span> You take it in <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Prapatti</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Just like I can surrender unto you when I have got full faith and devotion unto you. Otherwise, I cannot. That is wanted. If we simply surrender to God, then everything is complete. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the <span class="Italic">prapati</span> is described, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> this word: "After many, many births of philosophical speculation or personal endeavor to understand what is God, when he's actually wise, he surrenders unto Me." And it is said next line, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ: [Bg. </span>7.19] "Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything." When he understands this, then his knowledge is perfect. But such kind of <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> great soul, is very rare to be seen." (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So she said that in..., it is also explained that those who are not intelligent enough to study, or who are out of caste, so they cannot, they don't have the right to study, then it is said that they can attain God directly by surrendering unto God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly. It does not require education, knowledge or anything. If he agrees to surrender to the lotus feet of God, then his life is perfect. That is stated in the Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">naradita yadi hari sthapasata tat kim</span> (?). "If one has surrendered himself to the lotus feet of God and worshiped Him, there is no more need of austerity and penances." And <span class="Italic">naradita yadi hari sthapasata tat kim</span> (?). "If one has not learned how to surrender to God and worship Him, then all his austerities, knowledge, are useless." <span class="Italic">Antar-bahiḥ yadi hari sthapasata tat kim</span> (?), "If one can see God within and outside, then where is the necessity of austerity?" And <span class="Italic">naradita..., nan tad yadi bahi hari sthapasata tat</span> (?), "If one has not learned to see God within and without, then where is the value of his austerity and penances?" Therefore God realization is the only business of the human being. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> So they agree totally with what you said. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (Translating) Well, first you said that, first we must learn about God and then we will know how to pray to God, but now you say that if one surrenders to God, one has no need to learn about Him first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But unless one... We say, "Unless you have learned what is God." That means you have to learn God. Then religion... Religion means... What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says, "But God reveals Himself to us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is fact. If you are actually devotee, then God will reveal. That is... That is stated in the Vedic language, <span class="Italic">ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234] "You cannot understand the form, name, attributes, pastimes of God by these blunt senses." These senses, present (the ten) senses, cannot realize. <span class="Italic">Ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ. Indriya</span> means sense. Then how to realize? <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span> When you begin service with your tongue, then gradually God reveals. So tongue means you can do two business with the tongue. One is talking, and one is eating. So if you engage your tongue in glorifying God, and if you eat God's <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then you realize God. Therefore these young boys and girls from Europe and America, they have been, they are being taught, "Use the tongue for Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and eat Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" And as practical result, although they are very young, still, they have realized God, Kṛṣṇa, far advanced than anyone else. They have forgotten all material things: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, gambling. They are simply devoted in the service of Kṛṣṇa. So because they have engaged their tongue in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> they have forgotten all kinds of intoxication, meat-eating. The American Government spent millions of dollars to stop their LSD habit. They could not stop even one man. But as soon as they come to Kṛṣṇa conscious, immediately give up. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> They say they are very glad for all of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. So let us join together and push on this movement. (French) Chanting the holy name of God. You don't... I don't say that you take Kṛṣṇa, the name of... If you have got any other name, you can chant. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So he says, therefore, as you are glorifying God, we hope you will think of us just as when we glorify God, we will think of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He was very sad yesterday when there was some people making noises.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the difficulty. They are... Gradually, the population of the world are becoming urchins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Urchins. Very degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was discussing from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> how people will degrade in this age. And this is due to lack of God consciousness. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says your lecture yesterday evening was very objectionable to many of the young people who made so much disruption. They found many of the things you were discussing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the young people gradually degrading. They do not acknowledge authority. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes. When they saw how much we were speaking authoritative, they rejected it. They reacted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is their degradation, due to degradation. They cannot accept any authority. And knowledge cannot advance without authority. (French) But one thing I may say that the disobedience to the authority has begun from their fathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> From?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From their fathers. Yes. Because in the Bible it is said, "Thou shalt not kill," and their fathers indulge in killing business. So naturally their generation has degraded. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He said whether there was much discussion after the meeting last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes. There was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, they stayed until midnight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The total attendance yesterday was close to two thousand people. And at least one thousand people stayed until twelve o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> Twelve o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes. The manager of the hall was pleading with us to ask them to leave. He wanted to go home. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says that's very good that so many stayed to find out more information, to ask, to discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, any reasonable man will find subject matter interesting. There is a statement of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-dayā karaha vicāra:</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 8.15] "Just consider and then give your judgement after studying the mercy of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu." It is never recommended to take it blindly. <span class="Italic">Karaha vicāra:</span> "Just judge with reason and argument." And <span class="Italic">vicāra karile citte pābe camatkāra:</span> "If you consider it with logic and judgement, then you'll find it is sublime." (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So an interpretation of a scripture, whether it be Bible or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> cannot simply be an opinion, but it must be based on logic and reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like in the Bible it is said, "There was only word in the beginning." So in the beginning, there was word. That means that word is not the word of this material creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just like these Guru Maharajis. They say you cannot chant the name Kṛṣṇa because it's simply a material sound. They say the name is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. The rascal does not understand what is this sound. He does not see that there was word before creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Also in Revelation in the Bible it states that in the spiritual world there is no need for sun and moon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because the body of God is giving off light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the residents also, they are bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in the sun planet, all the inhabitants, they are fiery body. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> They said that they told me before they came that they could stay only one hour, so now they to take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> One hour we have passed? Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Distribute this flower. Come on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Bring the chair so that she can sit. (some guests leave)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American man:</span> I would like to ask you what you think of the Hebraic <span class="Italic">Kabbalaḥ.</span> I would like to ask you what you think of the Hebraic <span class="Italic">Kabbalaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He asked, "Do you have an opinion on the Hebrew scripture, the <span class="Italic">Kabbalaḥ?"</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have neither read it, I do not know it. I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Oh, Madame Devi doesn't have much time. Perhaps she had some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She'd like to know about the problem of death, what's happening at the time of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So as you prepare yourself... Because... Just like in dream we think what we have actually performed, similarly, the mental condition at the time of death will be prepared as we are doing in our usual life. Do you understand English? (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I'm American.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She believes that the thoughts are more important than the acts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Thoughts. She asks, she says, "Perhaps thoughts are more important than actions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thoughts are the subtle action. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She says, "Compared to the problem of the Bayonne, what's happened in Bayonne, the thoughts are more important than the action because the thoughts..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> "The thoughts begin the action."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "The thoughts begin the action, determine the actions."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore we give thoughts beyond your present thoughts from the authoritative Vedic scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Do you think that in the future all religions and all these spiritual groups will come together and form one group."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "all religion." There is only one religion. One who deviates, he creates another religion. Religion means there is God and we should be obedient to God. This is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> She says, "Therefore is not necessary to go by one's special path?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no special path. There is only one path, that "God is there, God is great, and we are all subordinate to God." That's all. No, if you... They accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I think that each man finds his own way, and that some people, because of the blood they have and because of who they have been before, can go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, do you accept this principle, that "God is great, and we are all subordinate to Him"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> My principle is the light, that there is only the light. If some people wish to call it God, they can call it God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> If they wish to call it Jesus Christ, they can call it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we, we, we also say that. We are all life, and God is the supreme life. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> God, for me, is a word. It's a word which no one can understand, which no one can say what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply you understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I understand the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you understand. You say, "God is word." That means you understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you say, "God is word"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I say God cannot be explained with words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why do you say? If you do not know God, how do you say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Because I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you do not know the subject matter... You say that "God is not knowable," then how can you speak of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I do not speak of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are speaking that "God is word." You say, "God is word."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> No, I say God is only a word, and that's why I cannot speak of God, because it's a word and it cannot explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have got this word. Why you speak all these contradictory things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> No. I say that I cannot speak of God because it is a word...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you do not know what is God. First of all accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> It is light. I speak of the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, then you know God. You say either way, that you know... Sometimes you say you do not know; sometimes you say you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Sometimes you say you know the light. That means you know God. For you, God is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> If you wish to call it "God..." No, no, no, no. I say it once. I will say it once and once only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, now, you say that God is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> So we'll understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you say, "God is light"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you know God. Then why do you say, "God cannot be known"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I say that "God" is a word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say, "light" or "word." What is the... What is the definite...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I believe in what I feel right here, and that is God for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you feel sometimes something else. That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I feel the light here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere you feel, the first of all let us know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I feel the light here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, anywhere. Light is here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> And that's all there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That is all right. Light is here also, not only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Light is here. Light is this table.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Light is this floor. Light is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that's all right. Then why do you say that you do not know God? You know God is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Because for me, God is merely a word. How can you explain God with a word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> I think you've been defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> No, no, I don't think I've been defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> And I'm not warring. I'm not making war with you. I simply want to understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you... You fix up one thing. You say, "God is light." That word light is God? Or that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I do not say God is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I say there is only light. I say there is only light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I do not speak of God; I speak of light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you do not know God. You accept one position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I say there is light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But you do not know whether light is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> What is God? Explain to me what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Talk with him. He'll simply waste my time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> If you can explain to me what is God, I would appreciate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just go and take him. You go and he'll explain to you, please.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> He cannot explain to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you go away. Please. What can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> It's as you wish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot waste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> If you cannot explain to me what is God... I speak of light, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you know everything. What can I explain? You know everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> I speak of light. I don't say I know everything, but I speak of light, that's all. That's all I said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> You're wasting our spiritual master's time. What is the point in coming here if you're just going to talk nonsense? Please come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">American Man:</span> Oh, I'll come. (leaves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Why was he brought in in the first place. Anyway, we can continue, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Is there some, any qualities, in the sense that some people have more receptivity towards the divine than other people?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I explained, <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.</span> Those who are in <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> they can understand easily. Those who are in <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa,</span> they have got difficulty. And those who are in <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> they cannot. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> "Is this degree of covering, whether they are in goodness, in passion or in ignorance, is that a question of their physical body? Is it a question of their hormones or chemical state? Is it a chemical state that some people are more covered than others by the modes of nature?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Covered means with some dirty things. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> By past <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sun is covered with the cloud. That list is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She asks if by repeating the <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> the name of God, it has more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You become purified. Purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You give the example all the time of the more you polish the mirror, the more the light can shine. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She says, "Therefore we have to repeat a lot of times the name of God every day."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She is very happy to meet you and she thanks you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Tell her also that at the time of death one who fixes the mind on the name of God will go back to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madame Devi:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So it's time for Śrīla Prabhupāda's massage. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In old age he'll be crippled like that. Then he said that "I am also going to be like that? No. What is the value?" Then he began meditation, how to stop old age. Then he gradually became very great, saintly person, and studied <span class="Italic">Veda, karma,</span> and by bad <span class="Italic">karma,</span> one becomes subjected with material tribulation, and the most of the bad <span class="Italic">karma,</span> he thought, was killing of animals, so he wanted to stop this. That is Buddha's... "Stop animal killing." <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's not <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva.</span> He's <span class="Italic">jīva-tattva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Śaktyāveśāvatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Did you say three? One or three?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When you offer something... You once said in Delhi, "Either one or three."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is neck bead. No. Yes. Yes, not... Yes, yes. <span class="Italic">Ārati. Ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, Śrutakīrti had offered my son two cookies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And I think you said, "Either one or three."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Two or four?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two or four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is there some reason behind this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Three is offered to the enemy. If I offer something, three, that means "You are my enemy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So how many sticks of incense? Two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no such...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Now, one thing is that we accept Buddha as incarnation of Kṛṣṇa on reference from <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but Buddha denied the value of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... When we pray, offer pray, it is stated that that is his, one of the qualifications. <span class="Italic">Sada... Nindasi. Nindasi yajña-vidher.</span> The animal sacrifice is recommended... Some of the sacrifices or all of them... So that animal sacrifice was not meant for eating. Just to give them new, rejuvenated life by the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras,</span> to test that whether Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are being chanted properly. And because at the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> there is no such expert <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> all sacrifices are forbidden. So later on, as they deteriorated, they began to offer sacrifices, and if anyone wants to stop it, they will say, "Oh, it is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>" Just like these rascals, Christian: "Oh, Christ ate fish. Therefore we must maintain slaughterhouse." Just see how rascal they are. Supposing Christ ate somewhere fish. Therefore they would maintain regularly slaughterhouse of cows. This is their brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> When you were here last year, there was a meeting at the Indian Tourist Bureau, a press meeting, and there was a man who came to meet you at that time who is president of the court of Paris. And he was supposed to be a Buddhist. Do you remember this gentleman? He said to you that "Meat-eating... We must eat meat in the West. Maybe in India, because of the climate, you can get away with that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom, another rascaldom. He's a first-class rascal. That was the support by Vivekananda. He was eating everything. All the Ramakrishna Mission, they say like that, "Oh, without meat-eating, without drinking, you cannot stay." All rascals. Therefore, the conclusion is, all rascals, the religious, social, all rascal. If they want to be saved from their rascal position, this is the only, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If they don't want to be saved, if they want to go to hell, who can check? <span class="Italic">Ātma-han. Ātma-han</span> means "self-suicide." Suicide, yes. If you cut your throat yourself, who can save you? So they are all these like, all, all these Buddhists, Christian. We may not speak very strongly. They will be our enemies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's other guests here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shortly. But this is the position. They're all rascals. But we don't hate anyone. We want to raise them. Actually they're all rascals. Do you accept this philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that they are all rascals? Hare Kṛṣṇa. Let them come forward. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Please come. Sit. Please come sit. (end)</div>
