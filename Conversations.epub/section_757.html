<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Indian 6:35.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...fire, explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, because people can't see life in fire, they think there's no life in it, so therefore there's no life in the sun. But it's just like the Tata factory. When you see it from a distance there's many planes and fires, but inside there's many people who are working. Therefore just because you can't see life in fire doesn't mean it's not there. We see life in the earth, we see life in the water, we see life in the air, so why not in the fire? Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now question, answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, one question is that the people in the Tata factory are not actually in the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are also not in the fire. I say even if it is in the fire, there is no harm because the living soul is not burned to fire. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Adāhyo 'yam. Dāhya. Dāhya</span> means burned. It is not burned. These are wrong conception. Because they have no conception of the soul, they think <span class="Italic">bhaṣmi bhūtasya dehasya:</span> "When the body is burned, then the soul is also burned." If the soul is burned, then where is the question of <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span>? How? In the Hindu system they burn the body. So if the soul is also burned, then where is <span class="Italic">punar janma</span>? You?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can accept that the soul is not burned, but what about the body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body is burned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So how can any body live in the sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are.... No, if.... They have got fiery body. As your body is made of earth, the fish body is made of water, and the so many others, different elements, so similarly, there the body is made of earth..., er, fire, fiery body. The so-called scientist, educationist, they.... Everything they conclude according to his own position. Therefore <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> They think Kṛṣṇa also "like me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The fish is in the water, but the fish is not water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, fish is not water, but he has got a body suitable for the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So the people on the sun have earthly bodies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...who can tolerate heat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no heat. They live.... Just like.... They are not suffocated. They don't feel any inconvenience. They enjoy. Against the waves they enjoy. You cannot go against the waves. They can go, even small fish. You'll find within this there are so many animals, so many. How they are living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Also science cannot explain how it is burning. Where is the fuel supply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And there is no smoke, no waste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. They are all.... Therefore we say simply "rascals." We have given this title to them everlastingly. All rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> How Kṛṣṇa is working, they do not know. This is Bay of Bengal. Other side is Burma. [break] ...are so strong, it will never be drowned. Eh? (Hindi) The scientist says there is no life. Just disagree with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists, yes, they say there is no life in the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they say in every planet there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, only the earth planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, they have to qualify. They say, "life as we know it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They say, "There is no life as we know it," but there's some forms of life that they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, but no, no. "As we know," but what do you know? You are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are trying by radio waves to reach people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Sarva-ga,</span> this word is. <span class="Italic">Sarva-ga. Jivātmā</span> (Hindi)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> [break] ...sending radio signals to faraway galaxies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of their radios? Do you think that their radios are perfect? Do you think so? What, Acyutānanda Mahārāja? Radio perfect? It is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And I think the demigods and higher beings, they can disturb all their radio attempts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Because they don't want trespassers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...how you can accept their radio machine are perfect? Because it is made by imperfect person, so how it can be perfect? If the manufacturer is imperfect, how he can make perfect machine? Nothing is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Actually the United States government has a whole agency for unidentified flying objects that people have seen that they keep secret so as not to frighten the whole America thinking that visitors from other planets will come. But there are many incidents of pilots who fly around in airplanes, who see other strange-looking objects coming at them, flying at them, or people from the ground have seen many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One guy testified that he was picked up and taken away for four days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they are? They are police? No. Mounted police?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, mounted police.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A mounted police here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Saber. Sword.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, it's a stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh, yes, <span class="Italic">lāṭhī,</span> made like a stick. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Why they are guarding here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I think for the horses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're exercising the horse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] ...house in Bengali. Is this where Swami Vivekananda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. After coming back from foreign countries, he made his position here in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Beautiful building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In Calcutta we have a life member, Veni Śaṅkara Sharma? You stayed at his house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So he wrote a book called <span class="Italic">An Unknown Chapter of the Life of Swami Vivekananda.</span> And in there he openly says that he smoked a hookah and ate meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is known to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Was he praising that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It was.... You know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> In Hyderabad there is a cook who used to cook for the Rāmakrishna Mission, and he said they used to cook any kind of meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I said, "Did you ever cook human meat?" He said, "If they told me, I would have done that also." There was nothing beyond their diet. "Anything they told me to cook..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This building belongs to Vivekananda's society, no? Vivekananda house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That's Bengali. "The house of Vivekananda."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They say Swami Vivekananda walked barefoot all over India at some stage of his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That.... This statue here is his life as a wandering <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>? Then question is, who is a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>? Who is a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>? You cannot say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> One who is Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Api cet sudarācaro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless one is cent percent Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is not a <span class="Italic">sādhu.

<div class="Purp-para">This is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This is the vehicle in which we travel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This vehicle is the vehicle in which we travel to all the different cities for making the life members and arranging all the programs in South India, this vehicle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is your own?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> We are renting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I was in South Africa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Johannesburg. This beach reminds me of that beach. You were with me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All statues are crying here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> This is Annie Besant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">avatāra</span> here, and she also came from Ireland to become <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I heard how she became interested in the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> She was Christian, and her infant died. So she asked priests, "Where will this soul go, to heaven or hell? And why? Because he hasn't done anything." So she was never satisfied with their answers. So then she heard that there is transmigration of the soul. Then she became interested in the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So did she understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, only up to transmigration of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She admits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was open? If there are any doubt. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> ...all practical things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> ...political things. Two and two will always be four. But we people don't agree so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You want five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (laughter) We want five, correct. Four to make it five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a story that a grocer's son was doing business, and when he was given a five-rupees' note, so he was giving four rupees. So the customer said, "Why you are giving me four rupees?" "No, I do not know what is the exchange." "No, it is six rupees." So "No, father will be angry." (laughter) Means he knows perfectly well what is five rupees, but he is innocent when he was giving four rupees. And when the customer wanted six rupees, he, "No, my father will be angry." [break] ...created a havoc by misinterpreting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> all people. According to their wish, "Five-rupees note means four rupees," by imagination. They have created havoc all over the world. Otherwise everything is there. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> If we take Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then whole world becomes immediately happy. But they will not take it. They will manufacture their own, two plus two equal to five or three, not exactly the four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> So all anxiety and <span class="Italic">duḥkha</span> have been created by the man himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Nobody else is doing for him, but he created himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> And then he said, "I am in misery. I am in trouble." Trouble is created by you. Nobody has created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that mind is the enemy and mind is the friend. So we created our mind, enemy or friend, and we suffer for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Mind is very, very powerful. How to make use of that? Actually mind is using the man; man is not using his mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.</span> In another line...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhakta?</span></div>

No, <span class="Italic">mano-rathena:</span> "He is hovering over the mind." <span class="Italic">Asāto dhāvato bahiḥ:</span> "He will stick to this <span class="Italic">asat.</span>" But the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">asato mā sad gamaya.</span> He cannot go to the real platform of life. <span class="Italic">Asato bahiḥ.</span> They do not understand that this godless civilization is the root cause of all calamities in the world. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.</span> The Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.</span> Twenty-four hours you have to do that.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahamsa:</span> Many people were purchasing books. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prominent place. (Hindi) Keep in prominent place so that others can see. And any book which is not in stock, you can note down his order so that you can send him later on.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian men:</span> Yes. (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> ...sleep on the streets. They've arranged this housing, it is very minimal. So what many of these slumdwellers do when people are living on the streets is they come here, and they go back and live on the streets, but they rent out the apartment that the government has given them and they keep the money. They go back and live on the streets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> This houses? This is all rented by the government and given free of charge to the poor to clear the slums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says,</div>
