<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He thinks that he's going to win. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ... that these rascal leaders, they cannot give us any comfort. All over the world. Here in the Gujarat, the students have insulted the leader, you know? So horribly, they have dragged the prime minister, chief minister, dragged him and set up and seated on an ass's back. In this way he was insulted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Prime Minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This was in Jerusalem?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Gujarat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The next province. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...speaking all the words that he has learned from him. Very good. Very nicely he's presenting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He's an elderly gentleman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, only twenty-five. [break] ...all these culprits, the burglars, the thieves, they should be punished exemplary. (chuckles) Yes, that should be done. [break] One telegram: "Come immediately Bombay. Everything is all right, Kṛṣṇa has blessed you." [break] I mean to say intelligent in their part, they'll at least give a chance to him. Yes. [break] ...doing all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said he didn't feel well, he was not going to take a walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said he felt too...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he thinks always, not to take walk, but when he takes, then it's good. [break] ...<span class="Italic">dharma,</span> what is <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I was not there yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you were not there. So what arrangement is made now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I got all the bus tickets for the devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...and for the plane tickets there was a little difficulty. I don't know how many plane tickets are available yet, but I definitely got minimum two. I don't know if I'll be able to get four, but I'm trying. I'm first on the waiting list, so... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...our nice program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, I told him to send a telegram in any case, but he has not sent, but if the..., if the program was not nice, then he would have definitely have sent some message to cancel the program. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...get help from them by his bogus program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vishva Hindu Parishad. What is this nonsense Vishva Hindu...? (chuckles) He does not know what is the meaning of Hindu. And his <span class="Italic">jñāna-yajña. Gītā jñāna yajña.</span> He does not understand even a word of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> and this rascal is preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This is going on. And he has made some name, people after him. People means if you flatter him, that "Whatever you are doing, it is all right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they will be very much pleased. And as soon as you criticize, that "You are doing this wrong, you will suffer." "Oh, yes, this Swamiji is not (indistinct)." That is going on everywhere. In the name of religion you do all nonsense rascaldom, and the leader approves, "Yes, you can do." Vivekananda did it. "Yes, there is no difference between eating meat and not eating eat in terms of religion system." He preached this, and all the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> of the Ramakrishna Mission they eat meat, they drink, they have woman secretary, everything. This Chinmayananda is also like that. I know his whole mischief. Unless one is purely Kṛṣṇa conscious, one cannot give up all these bad habits. This is the test. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anyatra caiṣa [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> One... Unless one is substantially advanced in <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> they cannot give up this material attachment-illicit sex, meat eating-they cannot. It is impossible. So even in the name of swami or big, big yogis... They are doing all these things. Especially those who go in foreign countries... In USA illicit sex is very cheap. Everything is very cheap. Yes. Intoxication very cheap, meat-eating very cheap, gambling, very cheap, so when they get this cheap amenities, they forget their so-called spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> One of our friends went to hear Chinmayananda, and he came back to the temple and he said, "Oh, he was speaking very nicely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So Mahāṁśa Swami said, "What did he say?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> "I do not know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Hariprasad's sons. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Rai Krishan (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They just speak very big words so that the language looks very nice, but people don't understand a word what they are saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Prabhupāda talks meaningless words, imitating the rascals; devotees laugh) They go on speaking like this. And people, "Oh, how amazing!" Simply give some grammatical form and talk all nonsense, people will appreciate. Jugglery. This is called jugglery. The Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> also do that. All the Māyāvādīs are against me, because I am talking about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and they screw their own meaning by jugglery of words. So they are all enemies. The Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs, smārta-paṇḍitas,</span> all of them. [break] ...has constructed a <span class="Italic">śiva-liṅga</span> temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga.</span> You have seen <span class="Italic">Śiva-liṅga</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A temple of... There are so many hundreds and thousands of Śiva temples, but nobody has exhibited <span class="Italic">śiva-liṅga,</span> big <span class="Italic">śiva-liṅga</span> on the head of the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Where is that, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bombay. And he's speaking on <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān<span class="Italic"></span></i>. <i class="calibre3">Gītār Gān</i> means to construct a big <span class="Italic">śiva-liṅga</span> temple. He's proving himself a rascal by his activities. He's a rascal number one. He has gone many times to foreign countries, but not a single foreign student he has got. [break] ...from atheistic fools who are not prepared to follow any rules and regulations, they are after him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That Sai Baba too...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Many of those young boys and girls, they are potential devotees. They are just in it for a bit of fun. A bit of fashion or fun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly Rajneesh. [break] ...very good intelligence, Lieberman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he's speaking very nicely. He's fit for that position. Similarly our, what is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Balavanta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balavanta. He's also very nice. If we get some important votes in the government, then our mission will be successful. This, our philosophy is being properly ventilated, it is coming in the papers, isn't it? On account of this political leadership. And I see that his statements are published profusely. Not with other contemporaries. And what they'll speak? They have no sense, they have no leadership idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Some devotees express the fear that after some time all these bogus groups, they will start running political men, too, and then the field may be ruined, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Soon, they say, especially the Bala-yogi, he always follows whatever we do, when we go out and distribute books, they do, when we have <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they do. So there's the fear that soon they'll all be running for office, all these bogus men, because we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot say anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have... This, the followers of the Bala-yogi they're simply rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They'll just be more exposed... They'll have to study your books (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot even speak... Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They'll have to study your books to find out what to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like our, what is this? Sai, Sai, Siddha-svarūpa. He also tried to imitate ourself, and by reading, reading, he became my disciple. Although he has the same mentality, still, still he does not find any better solution than our philosophy. The Karandhara, he went away (chuckles) and does not find any solution. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "I find no alternative to Kṛṣṇa's service," he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the final. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is final. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...start all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we'll be successful in America, then all over, everywhere it will be followed. [break] (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Today one very big minister is going to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He was a minister. His name is Channa Reddy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He used to be running for the chief ministership. He's very, very popular, but there was some mischief he did, for which he was taken to court and exposed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that mischief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I don't remember exactly, but he was taken to court and exposed and he was expelled from entering into any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...any elections for five years. So now his period is finishing, his five years is finishing, and he is going to stand again, and seems that he's very, very popular, he has a good chance. And he's our Life Member...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he's a Life Member?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He studies our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh, yes, he has taken our books and he especially asked that "I am reading these books and please give me." And he attended all the three days of the exhibition grounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> You maybe remember, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Channa Reddy. He's very nice. He'll be coming today at ten o'clock. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the modern politicians. Here at the present moment their philosophy is that one must be very cunning diplomat, then he's successful politician. This is their philosophy. The most crooked man, like Cāṇakya. But our philosophy is that the political head should be like Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, Lord Rāmacandra, that is difference. Here Churchill or Hitler or similar man, crooked man... Without being crooked one cannot become politician. Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister, he said that "Consistency in politics is the qualification of an ass." Consistency. You must change. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> You should never trust a politician, so if you cannot trust a politician, why we elect him as a leader, why should he be a leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, "Do not trust" means you are also not trustworthy, nobody trusts you, and you should also not. That is their philosophy. All these big, big politicians, just like United Nations. The same philosophy is going on. Nobody trusts anyone, but they speak big, big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Did he mean because the politician will degrade... (end)</div>
