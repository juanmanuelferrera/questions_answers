<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Death is an artifact. There is no death. That is what Arjuna thought, and now, still, sir, you say they are dead. What is death? There is no death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arjuna's thought is different. That is Arjuna's thought. I mean these people, these materialists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam akledyo aśoṣya eva ca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they are actually dying and they are flying also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who is dying? The body. The body is nothing but the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no such conclusions. We have got, that is a different thing, but they are trying to kill the mosquitoes to save themselves, but they cannot save. That is my point. They cannot save. When the "death mosquito" will come, he has to accept it. That he cannot manu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He, after all, is what we call ego. When the ego dies, then, sir, there is no he or she or mosquito or man or anything, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he is not that man. He is trying to kill the mosquito to save himself from death. But that he cannot. That is my proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. He could at least save the American government from catastrophe, how to drain before finishing this Panama Canal. The Panama Canal is an engineering feat, sir. The two sides, seas, are uneven, and they have made locks in the.... You must have seen that. No? They have locks. One side, sea is higher than the other, and they allow the ships to get to the middle lock, then pump in water and then bring on that side. Engineers must be knowing, you know. We had to study all these things, medical history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many medicines, vitamin D, vitamin C...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All medicines, sir, vitamins, and all even hormones...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why not discover something that you will save from death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But what is death, after all? Our forefathers found it out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are trying to live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We want to make you live in a good way so that you can think well and solve your life. That is what we are doing. We don't want to keep your, this body going on for all the time. Who says, sir? I do not think that is the aim of the medical profession, to keep...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have to accept because they cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We give you health, sir, from the disease. We don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot give health. Why he is dying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Dying is not health. We talk of health and disease, not of the death and life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Unless there is some disease you do not die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, what is disease? Disease is something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again you are coming to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...that is not physiological. The end of physiology is death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are trying to cure it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We don't try to cure it. We.... According to our whim, we try to help nature's natural process. Who knows? We may be going against nature, for all that. We don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is the value of your health if you do not save him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The value of the health is being found out the whole over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, I am asking you. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You know it better. Why ask me? Modern science is especially to give chemistry and biology. They have learned so much. I mean, practically they have really reached that position which the <span class="Italic">vaiśeṣika śāstra</span> reached in past. Vaiśeṣika is one of the six <span class="Italic">darśanas.</span> They also tried to prove the existence of God and God creation by that method, because they also believed in <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> We are also trying to do the same thing by our own way. And real modern scientists have found out that nothing can happen without God. But you.... In your time, when you were a student, scientists were atheists. Now scientists are not atheists, sir. So I beseech you to remove that idea from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Well, impersonal philosophers are more dangerous than the atheist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That you think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Caitanya Mahāprabhu says. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Let's not discuss about this, not go into it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, <span class="Italic">veda na maniyā bauddha haila nāstika. Vedāśraya bauddha-vāda nāstika ke adhika.</span> We accept atheist, one who does not believe in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Therefore we have rejected the Buddha philosophy. They could not exist in India. But those who are preaching atheism through <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> impersonal, they are more dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That impersonal preaching is not atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> For example?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone impersonalist-"God has no form." There are so many rascals. So he has got form to speak against God, and God has no form. This is going on all over the world. He speaks against the God, that "God is not a person." So he is person, and God is not person. Just see their foolishness. He is made by God, and he is a person, and who made him, he is not a person. This is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, there's a good sense in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.... But therefore they are senseless, that "I am person, my father is person..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, my father is not my person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is understood that I am person, my father is person, his father is person, and the supreme father is not a person. Just see. If the supreme father is not a person, then wherefrom these personal fathers came here? <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. "Mām"</span>-this is person. The <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> cannot understand that the supreme father is a person. Therefore Arjuna, at the, when he understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he declared that "It is very, very difficult..." (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. "...to understand Your personality. It is very, very difficult." Arjuna has said. And he has accepted Him as person, <span class="Italic">puruṣaṁ śāśvatam:</span> "You are eternally person." <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramam, puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādyam</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there. The real understanding is there. And he said, "This is.... This is accepted by Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Devala." <span class="Italic">Svayaṁ caiva:</span> "And You are also speaking." Then where is the question of imperson? Hare Kṛṣṇa. And therefore He, Kṛṣṇa, says <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānvān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> "You are person; I surrender unto You"-this knowledge comes after many, many births of this impersonalist. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> "That great <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is very rare." So one who believes and accepts the Supreme as person, he immediately becomes a <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> Otherwise he remains <span class="Italic">durātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Small <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> He's a <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> He's a small <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Who believe in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Believe not. Not only believe, but convinced, "Yes, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]." Then he is <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything is Vāsudeva. There is nothing excepting God. In that way there is no <span class="Italic">māyā</span> because <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is also a part of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> you surrender. Then you get the <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> After <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> you get the <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> (Hindi) We <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> we go on argument, but unless and until we <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> are convinced, we will remain <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> We can't help it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are big <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> who are never convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Like me. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, listen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I will argue with you instead of.... Mahārāja, you see, I have.... Again we had a very great altercation within myself. I was a.... [break] I may tell you, I have studied the Vaiṣṇava's philosophy from various angles. The last two years I have been making a very deep study of it, and I am a student of this theologian philosophy. I think he is absolutely right, that complete surrendering to God by <span class="Italic">bhakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...you get complete <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was.... Before I thought it was not so, but it is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But as you are convinced, but I am not convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Therefore you read like me and you will be convinced. You study like me, go to temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are still a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, I am still a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> According to you, I am a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> But according to me, though I am <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> but I don't feel that I am <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> "The man who knows not but who knows not that he knows not, he's a first-class fool." Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the great problem of the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> that he is <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> but he is thinking, "I am not <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, that is the point. Everybody knows it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, you see, impersonal and personal God, I am talking. I.... Perhaps you may not like. You know, the people.... You see, impersonal God is nothing but the emanation of God. As he said, the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> or what as he once gave me that example, that sun and its rays, if you put a sort of mirror, you see the same sun there through the rays. Don't you? In the same way, you may see God everywhere that way, but real God is sun. Like that, God is there, but His emanation is Brahman. Parabrahman is God; Brahman is <span class="Italic">jyoti</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Am I right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you go to Brahman but not to Parabrahman. When you try to realize Parabrahman, that is personal God; Brahman is impersonal God. Right, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And He says, <span class="Italic">brahmaṇo 'haṁ pratiṣṭhā: "Brahmajyoti</span> is emanating from Me." <span class="Italic">Brahmajyoti,</span> although impersonal, it is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I will one day preach in your place. (laughs) I will.... (Hindi) I was a professor in college, and I have got a knack of explaining everything. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So, all right. I will be your <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then you become his <span class="Italic">śiṣya,</span> that's all, indirect <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> For the last two year I have been only reading all the great writings of Vaiṣṇava saints and Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> because I read a lot of Śaṅkarācārya and others, and even, even post-what do you call-Buddhist philosophy, different lines, half a dozen of them. When I read the Vaiṣṇavas' teaching I think that.... Personally, you see, there are so many children, but your own son, you say, "This is my son." The personal relationship, when established, takes you far ahead psychologically. Am I right, sir? That is how personal God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you take care of your own son, nobody will criticize you that "Why are you taking care of your own son, not others? Nobody will.... That is natural. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad.... Samo 'haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9</span>.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is equal to everyone. But one who is a devotee, "I take special care."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "He is in Me, and I am in him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why all the great <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> all the great, I mean, say, Narsi Meta(?) or Mirabai, they have worshiped personal God and merged in personal God <span class="Italic">in toto.</span> Their, that what we call that ego is washed away by the sacred, I mean, this thing of God. Our impersonal philosophers are there, but they are not so well known. That is why he said that personal God and, I mean, worshiping personal God, you are immediately raised to that status from where you will be able to get <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] There was one teacher in my school, he used to say that "One who is slow to understand, he is slow to forget also."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, that's a fact. It's really a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And one who understands quickly and he forgets quickly. So Dr. Patel has understood slowly. So he'll never forget it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Actually that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have been very critical within myself. All my.... All my studies, medical, otherwise, I have been always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes, critical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have studied even geology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Critical student, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Out of just fun, what it is about. I am a student all round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi) [break] It is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. Paripraśna</span> is required, but after <span class="Italic">praṇipāta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Surrendering yourself. In school also they say if you develop a sort of a liking for your teacher, a sort of a reverence is developed in you, and then you get knowledge much quicker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If you take your teacher to be a servant of yours, then you won't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vedic principle. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he'll get knowledge. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is fact. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu also says, <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-krpā:</span> "By the mercy of guru and Kṛṣṇa."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He holds your hand and gives that hand to God. That is guru. That is what I think. Am I right in a way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Transparent medium. [break] (Hindi) ...realization.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">tato bhāvaḥ sādhakānām ayam premnaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ.</span> [break] Vaiṣṇava doesn't make any discrimination that "He is Hindu," "He is Muslim," "He is this and that." He takes everyone as servant of Kṛṣṇa. [break] In India the caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> criticize me that "Swami Bhaktivedanta is putting Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma</span> ruin." Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> never.... I think <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not by birth <span class="Italic">vibhāgaśaḥ.</span></div>

It is not that "Such and such caste can come here." No, anyone, if you are qualified, that's all. They are accusing me that I am ruining Hinduism, but they have ruined the Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You say, sir, "The Bengalis have ruined Hinduism; I am salvaging it." Another Bengali is salvaging the ruined Hinduism.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu converted many Pathans to become Vaiṣṇava. He changed the name. One Pathan was named Rāmadāsa. Just like I have changed Ramjan into Rāma-rañjana, Attar into Atreya Ṛṣi.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. If the dictator, executive officer, is very nice, religious, then there is no need of this election.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, she goes to the temples, all right. (laughs) (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. She has got the tendency of spiritual life and she requires improvement. That's all. She has spoken in Chandigarh that "Now we require spiritualism." Hm?</div>
