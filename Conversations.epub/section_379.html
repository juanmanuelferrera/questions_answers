<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you should call learned. <span class="Italic">Arcye viṣṇau śilā-dhīr guruṣu nara-matir vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> You take it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...this quotation from <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa,</span> and distribute it by transcribing to all our devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That's the verse that says that one is a resident of hell...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Nārakī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> ...if he considers the Deity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nārakī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Arcye viṣṇau...</span> [break] ...when it will teach military art, with <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> soldiers will, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa..." (laughter) We want that. Marching with military band, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." You maintain this idea. Is it not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there will be military march of Kṛṣṇa conscious soldiers. Anyone who does not believe in Kṛṣṇa, "Blam!" (laughter) Yes. The same process as the Mohammedans did, with sword and Koran, we'll have to do that. "Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa or not?" "No, sir." "Blam!" Finished. (laughter, Prabhupāda laughs) What do you think, Madhudviṣa Mahārāja? Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) What these communists can do? We can do better than them. We can kill many communists like that. (laughter) Then it will be counteraction of communist movement. And you think like that. "Why you are sitting idly, no employment? Come on to the field! Take this plow! Take this bull. Go on working. Why you are sitting idly?" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nobody should be allowed to sit down and sleep. They must find out some employment, either work as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> Why there should be unemployment? The same example. Just like I am, this body is working. The leg is working, hand is working, brain is working, belly is working. Why there should be unemployment? You just stop this unemployment, you will see the whole world is peaceful. There is no complaint. And they'll very happily chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hm? Nobody's working in this field. They're all drawn to the cities to work in the factory. Condemned civilization. That communist emblem, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hammer and sickle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Yeah, good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But no hammer. Only this... What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Sickle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No hammer. That will be our emblem. Only sickle. Not hammer. The hammer has hammered the whole human civilization. So just make a counter-emblem. The communists will appreciate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sickle and <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> A sickle, and then a <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is good idea. Guptajī? Come here. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> (Hindi for few sentences)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal civilization, rascal government. And people are transferred into rascals. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Without <span class="Italic">anna,</span> how they can live? There is no arrangement for <span class="Italic">anna.</span> They're simply passing resolution, legislative laws. And no <span class="Italic">anna.</span> Just see what kind of wretched government it is. Everywhere. There is no <span class="Italic">anna. Annād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> The first duty of government is to see that everyone is happy, without any anxiety. These preliminary necessities of life, <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithunam,</span> there must be sufficient arrangement for these preliminary necessities of life. One must eat sumptuously. Not over-eating, indulgence. No. But he must have sufficient food to keep up the health. Similarly, he must have place to sleep. We, we are prepared to offer everything. And be Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is our mission. Not by eating and sleeping, become rogues and thieves and rascals. That we will not allow. That is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> (Hindi conversation for a few sentences) Why unemployment? There is no scarcity (of) water. Just have a big well. Electricity pump water. Oh, immediately, it will be all green. Immediately. (Hindi for a while) <span class="Italic">Jayo!</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! [break] ...all round, for the benefit of the human society. You'll be honored everywhere. Everywhere, any part of the world. And automatically these bogus <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> incarnations, God, and yogis and swamis will be all doomed. You see? These rascal society, <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> "Bhagavān," incarnations, yogis, these rascals will be doomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> These (indistinct) ought to be finished. They cannot remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No! (Hindi) ...that glowworm. Glowworm (Hindi) beautiful (Hindi) darkness <span class="Italic">hai.</span> (Hindi) So long people were in darkness, they were beautiful. Now there is sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda is the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] ...the anxiety of Prahlāda Mahārāja, "How these rascals, who have made a plan for happiness of a few men, gorgeous plan." And they're... For happiness of the government servant. That's all. You know in Delhi there is Planning Commission? What is that plan? That people may starve, and Indira Gandhi and company may flourish. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> I think, Mahārāja, they are coming to the office at twelve and going back at one, doing nothing, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what they have got to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> They are not doing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I have seen in London the Parliament. When they had some so-called empire... Now the Parliament is useless, useless. The Parliament members and the Lords, House of Lords, House of Commons, they are now useless. They have got some old books only. In Parliament. I have seen. Some old books. Old books means all the speeches are recorded in books. And who is going to read them? Almiras, so many... I have seen in Parliament. Hundreds and thousands of speeches recorded and bound up very nicely. Who is going to read them? Simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> They are increasing the load like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Donkey's load. Go on increasing, increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore this example is given: ass. For nothing, not for himself. He'll be given a little grass. The grass is available here. But still, he's engaged. Employment. Ass will reap, eat little grass. Grass is available everywhere. But still, he'll work for others, loading, overloading. This is ass. He has no sense, "So why I have taken so much overload? I can get grass anywhere. Let me remain free." But he has no such sense. Neither he will be allowed. (laughs) This is ass. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... [break] ...there are many <span class="Italic">bābājīs.</span> They are collecting <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> and smoking <span class="Italic">bidi,</span> and have one or two women. That's all. It is going on. So they should be drawn: "Come on! Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take the plough." Not that you become Rūpa Gosvāmī simply by smoking. They are thinking they have become Rūpa Gosvāmī. Rūpa Gosvāmī lived like that. So they think by changing the cloth, loincloth, they have become Rūpa Gosvāmī. And whatever nonsense they like, they can do. [break] ...taken and all these <span class="Italic">bābājīs</span> should be employed, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and draw plough." Then it will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In America too, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In America too, the big intellectuals and professors, they can also be... We can have ploughs for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they're wasting time. Better produce some food. At least, your food. You are living at the cost of others. What is the value of your philosophy? That... To... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: etaj jñānam, tad ajñānaṁ yad anyathā.</span> To search out the Absolute Truth, that is <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> knowledge, philosophy. Anything else, that is <span class="Italic">ajñānam.</span> [break] ...I think it is so that if you cannot use your plot of land, then it will go to the government. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, if the government cannot utilize, it comes to us. We shall work. Is it not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be some law like that. The government has taken from the public because it is not being worked out. Now we shall work. Give us this land. (Hindi) "You have taken from the public. Why should you not give us?" So that there will be no question, even government does not, we shall go and occupy, occupy, and go on tilling. What the government will...? Public will support us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Again it is being distributed to their relations, those who are in the power, and then they do not work again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Then it remains...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then whatever field is not being worked, we occupy them, and begin to work. And invite all the unemployed, "Come and join us. We shall give you food, shelter, everything." [break] ...how Kṛṣṇa is setting example. Kṛṣṇa is saying that "I have already arranged the result of this fighting. Everyone will be killed." <span class="Italic">Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin.</span> But still, He is inducing Arjuna to work. Not that He's already (indistinct), "I am your friend, Kṛṣṇa. Everything will be done." "It will be done, but you have to work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Maybe a friend or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is philosophy. Not that "Because I am friend, I will do, and you will sleep and get dysentery." No. You have to work. Everything is already arranged, but you must work. That is wanted. Otherwise, why Arjuna was induced to fight. Kṛṣṇa has already arranged. And Arjuna also: "Yes." <span class="Italic">Kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Whatever you say..." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break] ...politician, Balavanta? He's not here. So let him preach that "We shall, if you take our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, there will be no unemployment." He can at least give this manifesto to the..., "There will be no more unemployment." People will be very nice, very glad to hear. Now this machine, this machine nonsense means unemployment. One machine will work for hundred men. So hundred men becomes unemployed, and one technician, he gets all the salaries. To work on the computer, com...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Computer, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Machine. And he's very expert. He'll take three thousand dollars. And others will be unemployed. This is going on. And they are thinking: "Advancement of civilization." Advancement of civilization means "Exploit others and you become happy." This is advancement of civilization. "Others may die for such, out of starvation, and one man takes all the money and spends it for wine and women and motor car." That's all. This is advancement of civilization. <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhino bhavantu.</span> This is Vedic civilization. "Let everyone be happy." That is Vedic civilization. And the demonic civilization, they're: "Let everyone suffer; I become happy. That's all." And Vaiṣṇava is thinking, "For my salvation it is already guaranteed." But he is thinking, "How these poor people will be saved?" <span class="Italic">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja. This is Vaiṣṇava's position. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span> He's unhappy by seeing others unhappy. For himself, he has no unhappiness. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī. Kṛpāmbudhir yas tam ahaṁ prapadye</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. Vaiṣṇava shall work hard, undergo all tribulation, for others. He has no problem. A Vaiṣṇava has no problem. Because he has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, he has no problem. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa also gives guarantee, "Anyone who has taken shelter of My..., he is saved. I will give him protection." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ mokṣayiṣyāmi sarva...</span> Everything is there. For Vaiṣṇava there is no suffering, personally. But he is very much anxious: "How these rascals will be happy?" That is his business. "These rascals are misled. They are going astray, unhappy. So how they should be happy?" So that is Vaiṣṇava's business. So the Vaiṣṇava, therefore, will have no politics. Politics means planning for one's own happiness. That is politics. So in our society there should be no diplomacy, no politics. Everyone should be eager how to do good to others. That is Vaiṣṇava. If he's planning something, that "I shall be leader," "I shall be doing something," that is not Vaiṣṇavism. That politics is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It seems that people are so attached to sense gratification, if we tell them we want to stop all these facilities for drinking, cinema, women, like that, they become angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, that is natural. If you give good instruction to a rascal, he'll be angry. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śamayati</span> (?). <span class="Italic">Mūrkha,</span> a rascal, if you give him good instruction... But give him practical. "Come here. Sit down. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. And help me by doing this." In this way you have to... Just like a child. Child does not want to go to school, but some, by... Find out some means so that he'll be induced. That is intelligence. He'll be angry, naturally. He's a rascal. He'll be angry. That is not unnatural. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopayati na śamayati</span> (?). Just like a snake. You feed the snake with milk. It will increase the poison. That's all. Practically attract. Practically attract. That is the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement will practically attract the people. If the world affairs are adjusted according to our Kṛṣṇa conscious plan, there will be no difficulty for all the nations, all the countries. They will be happy. So we have to educate people gradually. And by our example, living example, we'll have to attract. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Local people:</span> (calling out in distance) Harilāljī! Harilāljī!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> At least they are remembering Harilāljī by seeing us. So much benefit was in that. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> When we pass, people say "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the test of Vaiṣṇava. If one is actually Vaiṣṇava, then by seeing him one will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This has been created all over the world. Yes. Wherever we go, they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Even at midnight in Athens. Yes. That we have experienced. This is the definition given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Prabhupāda, if Kṛṣṇa had already done all the work at Kurukṣetra, so why was He so eager to have Arjuna work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Because He'd already done the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Why did He want Arjuna to work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to show example, that "Don't sit idly, rascal. Work." Kṛṣṇa has already done, but you must work. This is the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> People will argue that "Why should we work? If we can make an arrangement for being idle..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> People argue that "If we can make an arrangement to be idle, then it's nice. We've worked so hard. Now we can be idle. That's nice."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, that, if you become idle, you'll be diseased. You'll have dysentery. That's all. That will not help you. You'll have to suffer. That, that, that stage has already come. Because so many rascals are idle, now there is so many things want. So you'll suffer. If you don't work, then you'll suffer. (end)</div>
