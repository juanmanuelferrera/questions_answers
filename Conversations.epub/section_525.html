<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So you can begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (Speaking in German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She makes a suggestion that we should do two things: one, to ask questions about Māyāpur as a significant holy place, not only for the devotees, but for the people, <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> who have never even heard of Māyāpur... (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And she says the second aspect of her questioning will be the practical side of it, like feeding the people here, like feeding the people here, what we are actually doing, like building this house, feeding the people in the neighboring towns, or teaching them English or teaching them how to cultivate the land, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our... You take answer one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not put all the questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So you can begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our ideal is that we have got this body, and there are some bodily necessities. That is the prime necessities. So we do not neglect these necessities of the body. But our culture is spiritual culture. Generally, people, being disturbed by the bodily necessities, they do not inquire about the spiritual identity. Actually this is the distinction between human life and animal life. (Hindi) [break] Our real purpose of this mission is to educate people about his spiritual identity. All people, they are misguided by the idea-(aside:) Don't do-that he is this body, everyone, all over the world, especially in the Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because rascal fools, they have no knowledge, just like cats and dogs, animals. Do you admit this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everybody's thinking that "I am this body." That is rascaldom. They have not even this primary knowledge of spiritual identity that he is not this body, although he has got very practical experience that a child is getting another body as a boy, the boy is getting another body as young man. Suppose I am... I know I had a body of a child. I still remember, when I was a child, six months old. I remember how I was lying down on the lap of my eldest sister. She was knitting, and I was seeing. Very vividly I remember. Now, where is that body? Tell me. Where is that body? Now sometimes I think that "I was jumping as a boy. And now I have to take this stick." So where is that, my jumping body? Tell me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> The body is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That body is no longer existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> I must change my body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Change. So the body has changed. But I remember that I had such a body. Therefore I am different from the body. I wish to possess again that body, to jump, but I cannot. This is the condition of my life. By nature's law I am getting one body and I am changing to another body. This is going on. So as in this life I have got this experience, that I have changed my body, similarly, the greatest authority, Kṛṣṇa, says that "When this body will be finished, you'll get another body," very simple thing. But these rascals do not understand. All these rascals, they do not understand. There is practical experience, and there is authoritative statement, and still, they do not know, and still, they are big, big professors, big, big learned scholars, doctor, scientist, philosophers. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> No knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> No knowledge</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> No knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That is the... That means everyone is in ignorance, and they are passing on as doctors, philosophers, scientists. This is the condition of the present civilization. Fools and rascals are passing on as doctor of philosophy, doctor of knowledge. First of all, you have to judge this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> But there are many gurus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> They think... What is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says there are many gurus and many people go there because it has become popular. So what do <span class="Italic">they</span> say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not bring in any guru. We are talking between ourselves. Don't bring any guru. Just talk as common men. So whether you agree to this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of guru. It is a question of common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very simple thing, that "I am changing my body, and similarly, I'll change this body." This should be understood by my present circumstances of life, and it is confirmed by the greatest authority, Kṛṣṇa. Knowledge by authority and knowledge by experience, both things are there. And still, the rascals do not understand. Knowledge is gathered by experience, and knowledge is gathered from the authority. Just like I ask my father, "What is this?" Father says, "This is bell." So this is knowledge. I get it from my father. And by experience, when I push it, it is ringing. So understand, "This is bell." So two sources of knowledge: by practical experience and by authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> I must believe what my father says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I have to. I have to take knowledge from my mother, from my father. That is the beginning of knowledge. Intelligent boy asks father, "What is this?" And father explains. Mother gives the knowledge, "Here is your father." So it is from authority. Otherwise, how you can experience who is your father? How do you get? Can you experiment who is your father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Yes. I ask my mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That is authority. That is not experiment. That is authority. Therefore knowledge by authority and knowledge by experience... So I am changing my body. You experience "I was child, I was boy, I was young man. I was middle-aged. Now I am old man." This is experience. And the authority says, "As you have changed this body, similarly, you change this body and get another body." This is authority. Then where is the lack of knowledge? So knowledge is already there in two ways: by experience and by authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> This life means that I must take a better body in this life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What is the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> No, not a question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, we have to understand that we... There are many sources of knowledge, but the summary is that knowledge gathered by experience and knowledge gathered by, through authority. So both knowledge is helping me about the change of body. So how can you deny it? And still, if you remain ignorant, then you are foolish. How you can say there is no life after death? I am giving you evidence by experience and by authority. Then mostly, perhaps you have got experience of the... In the, especially in the Western countries... Here, if you ask ordinary cultivator, he'll believe: "Yes, there is life." They they are philosopher. "Yes, in my past life I did something wrong. Therefore I am suffering. And if I do wrong, I'll suffer in my next life." You'll get this knowledge even from the cultivator. This is India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> India has the knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyone who is born in India, he has got immediately this knowledge. He immediately knows there is God. That is the advantage of taking birth in India. What it will take hundreds of years to understand, they understand it by the birth. You have seen, so many thousands of people came. So the... Apart from this, the whole world, they do not believe that there is soul and after annihilation of this body, we shall get another body, another chapter of life. They do not believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Then, she says, why do the philosophers not study in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Then again, the same question. Because they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are rascals, they are speculating. They do not understand how knowledge is gathered. This is our charge. You refute it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Just one sentence, Prabhupāda. Another thing is they know they are taking body again and again. They are taking the body again and again after birth. Why they are committing again and again sins and which mode of nature...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they do not know how to stop this process. That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You can stop this. But these... Again rascals. They'll not take the method. Kṛṣṇa said that "If you simply try to understand Me," <span class="Italic">janma,</span> "why I appear and why I come here and work," <span class="Italic">karma...,</span> "they are divine." The divine nature of Kṛṣṇa's appearance, disappearance and activities, if one can understand, then immediately he becomes free from this process. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> But the rascals will not do that. They'll misunderstand Kṛṣṇa. They'll misdescribe Kṛṣṇa. They'll think, "Kṛṣṇa is ordinary man." Gandhi will say that "I don't think there was any person living as Kṛṣṇa." And he is <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> These things are going on. <span class="Italic">Mahātmā</span> is proving himself as the greatest rascal. This is your <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> and what to speak of the <span class="Italic">durātmā.</span> So you are being guided by these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A lot of people in... Before I came to your temple in Toronto, in our family nobody is eating any meat. When I went West, I got it some, this point, and I was misguided by the different philosophies. So lot of misguiding and misled...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my rascaldom. Why I shall be misguided? I must know who is the right person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They are fallen from. A lot of people in India, they have all misguided and misleading, their own adjusted, their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have to gather knowledge from my superior. (Bengali) You came last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Ah, no, last evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, last evening? What is your...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He told to come at nine o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. What do you want to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I like, I like to join in the special (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You are welcome. You stay here with the devotees and learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I stayed in Madras for a month also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are staying here now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'd like to take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, stay. Make arrangement that he can stay. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You can stay. You can stay with us and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As other devotees are staying, you can stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But, er...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Akṣayānanda (?) Swami told me to come to Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go to Madras. Whatever you like. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says, "Therefore does it mean that the solution has to come from India?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Solution has to come from Kṛṣṇa. The book is there, solution, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you take it and practice it, the solution of all problems is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you take any problem and find out the solution from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says in the beginning it appears a little difficult to give up everything, but day by day, it becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the question of everything, giving up? It is to understand. First of all understand that what you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (to girl) Understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you have to understand that you are not this body. You are something beyond this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says we do not require as much as we like to believe we do. We do not require the things that we believe we require.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It means, it means apartment, furniture, money, family, and so many things. She says... She means that we don't require all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't say that. I have never said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But only for furniture and apartment, if you forget yourself and act in such a way, then next life you become a dog and lie on the street, then what is the use of your furniture? You are getting next life. First of all, you understand that, that "This is not the end of my life. I am eternal. I am changing my body." So it is described as dress. Now you may be dressed like a royal king. And next dress may be different. "May be" means it must be. And for the examples of the dresses-so many living entities. So you must be cautious that "What kind of dress I am going to have next?" [break] Where is that science? Where is that school, college? If you remain only confident that "I'll go on with this dress perpetually," that is not the fact. You'll have to change your dress. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> But we have no knowledge that "What kind of dress I am going to have?" It is a fact. I have already changed dress. I had a child dress. I had a boy's dress. I had a young man dress. Now I have got old man's dress. Now, Kṛṣṇa says that, "This also, you'll have to change." So why I am not inquiring "What kind of dress I am going to have?" and "How I am changing this dress?" So young man doesn't want to become old man. That is a fact. But if a young man says, "No, no, I don't want old man's dress," will it be accepted? Nature will say, "No, you must accept." Where is the remedy for this? Why these rascals do not understand that "I am fully under the control of nature's law, and I am declaring free. I am becoming philosopher"? He's fully under the control of nature's law. You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmaṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are fully under the control of the laws of nature, and still you are thinking "I am independent. There is no superior controller." What is this nonsense? Hm? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not foolish? You appreciate that you are under the control of material nature, and still, you are thinking independent. What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? I am in the prison house, and the prison superintendent is controlling me fully, and if I say, "I don't care for anyone," what is this nonsense? Even in ordinary life, if somebody says, "I don't care for government laws. I shall do whatever I like," is it very good sense? Similarly, you are fully under the control of material nature, and you are declaring independence. You should, rather, consider that "Why I have been put under the control of material nature? I don't want it. I don't want to be diseased. But why disease is forced upon me? I don't want to become old man. Why it is forced upon me? I don't want to die. Why death is forced upon me?" These should be the proper questions. But instead of questioning this, he's thinking, "I am independent." How much foolish he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So, she says, so the solution for the world is Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. Therefore we are pushing on this movement, to make the rascals intelligent. That's all. The whole world is full of rascals, and we want to make them intelligent. This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Ja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we call them rascals, they become angry. And actually they are rascals. They do not know the problems of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So she... Her next question is that in the last few days, approximately five hundred devotees have assembled here from all over the world. She says that she knows that this is the birthplace of Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So therefore they have come. She knows that it is a holy place. She wants to know that even before Lord Caitanya's time, was it also considered to be a holy place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is perpetually holy place, but it is known since the birthday of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Just wait one... [break] ...the cat's and dog's body. The cats and dogs, they cannot understand that, that life is beyond this body. But in the human form of life one can understand. He has got such consciousness. So by nature's law, by evolution, we come to the human form of body to understand this. And if we do not utilize this knowledge for understanding our real identity, then we remain cats and dogs, and we become again cats and dogs. By nature's law, I have been given this chance. If I do not utilize it properly, then again I become what I was before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> One has to be sincere. One has to be sincere to understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of sincerity; it is the question of ignorance. If, if the father, mother, teacher, government does not know that how the people should be raised, then they remain in ignorance. Just like a... If the child... Child is ignorant, but if he's not given the education...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says now in this movement a new generation is being raised up, the children that we have in our schools and in our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There... Therefore we are educating children even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> For the future</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, future generation. Because the so-called educational institutions, they have produced only fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says you cannot change the society? We want to produce a new society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No new society. A new status of consciousness. We don't want to change anything. We want to change the consciousness because they are in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says it is a great service or a help for the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says she has noticed here that if a new person comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he can understand what he can actually do. For example, she was very impressed by the dance troupe last night, and on the night before, the devotees. She's realized that they are dancing. She did not realize before that one can do just about anything for Kṛṣṇa. And she says this place immediately gives that impression, that anyone, in any station, he can be engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Oh. (Laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can engage anyone to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It does not depend on particular education, status of life. It doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Ahaitukī.</span> The exact Sanskrit word is <span class="Italic">ahaituky apratihatā. Ahaitukī</span> means without any cause and without being checked. If anyone wants to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, there is no impediment in the whole world which can check him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. She says if a person wants to give the best of himself, it is probably best to give that which he has learned throughout his life, to do it for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says, now, to your books, that, er... I can answer this question for her later, if she wants to know. How many books are already finished, and how much is more to come in the future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In fu... There is no limit. But I wish to write at least sixty books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German) More?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have already finished...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Four cantos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four cantos. And there are eight cantos more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says that... She says she wants to know if you think it would be worthwhile for her to write a book, something similar to the one that was written in America. It was called <span class="Italic">"The Strange World of the Hare Krishna People.</span>" You've heard of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But she says serious, not in the way it was written by her, because she is a journalist, and this is her natural inclination, and she has been here now since the beginning, and she is noting everything. So it is her natural tendency. Whether you think it is worthwhile for her to write a little book for the public?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is... It will be great service, provided you write nicely the right things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> To help you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People are in ignorance, ninety-nine percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Entire, whole world. They are going on. They are fighting on this bodily concept of life. So, apart from fighting... Of course, you cannot stop fighting. But at least a section of men must be in right knowledge. So what I say, that in the Western countries, they, even the very high, topmost educationists, they also do not believe that there is life after death, is it not? Am I right or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She understands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So just see how much ignorance is prevailing. So if you can dissipate this ignorance, darkness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So that... She says, yes, if one thinks in this way, then life has no sense, that there's no sense to it, if one does not believe in a life beyond this life. It is senseless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German) Then it's no life, no life after death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says therefore, therefore they feel anything can be done in this life because in next life there is nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. That I talked with big professors. They say. They say like that. Here also, the so-called Indian leaders, they are also thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says she has heard that in the universities in America it is being taught about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In some of the universities Kṛṣṇa consciousness is being taught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> It's a beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Just like Temple University, they have got this <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span> And many universities, they are studying <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> They are gradually accepting. At least the professors, teaching staff, they are accepting. They are studying as one side of views, not seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They speculate still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says it appears that one has to become again as a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She means... She says that it appears to understand this teaching one has to become again as a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If he does not forget what he has learned, then it will be difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says... She asks whether it will come to a fight with the demons and the devotees like Arjuna, or is this question, in the future, she means, or is this question not important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The fight is already going on. You cannot stop fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German) We must chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> We must chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the simplest way. That is the simplest way. If one sincerely chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, he becomes enlightened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> She says this is the main thing that Lord Caitanya has given the people in this age, a simple process to approach God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the highest perfection, to reach the highest perfection, that is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's special gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> As a conclusive question, she asks what can we do to help the, (German), the whole movement to continue to expand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What, what she can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Your, these Western countrymen, they are intelligent. So intelligently enlighten them. By intelligent statements, make a peaceful revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Right. Yeah. O.K.?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As these boys are changing their habits and their ideas, so similarly, it can be done to the mass of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> <span class="Italic">Ja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (aside:) Stop that also. [break] <span class="Italic">...kṛpana bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ, yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life is a concession for sex life. Otherwise, there is no need of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life. But everything can be used to make the best use of a bad bargain. That is another thing. Actually, to become free from all responsibility and anxieties, if one remains a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> that is very good. That is the recommendation of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> But if you cannot... Because the material world is going on under sex impulse, by nature the sex impulse is there. He will agitate you. But if you can control by becoming a rigid <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> that is better. But it is difficult. Therefore this concession is given. But what is this concession? The concession is sex life. That's all. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi sukhaṁ hi tuccham kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> It is an itching sensation. And after satisfying the itching sensation, there are so many responsibilities and trouble. But <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpanāḥ.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">kṛpanāḥ,</span> does not know how to utilize this life... So once I have taken to sex life and I am suffering so many after... Of course, now to stop the suffering, the have invented this contraceptive method. He knows there is suffering, but they, in order to avoid this suffering, they're taking this contraceptive method. And that is also suffering. That he does not know. <span class="Italic">Bhrun hatyā.</span> Contraceptive method means killing the embryo. So that is also another sinful. He's taking so much responsibilities. So either you take contraceptive method or do not take contraceptive method... If you do not take, then the child is born. Then you have to take responsibility. Now they're killing the child, in this way becoming implicated. But if one is trained up to remain a rigid <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> there is no trouble. Therefore it is said,</div>
<div class="Verse">tṛpyanti neha kṛpanā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kaṇḍutivān manasi yaḥ viṣayeta dhīraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.9.45]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">I know if I satisfy this itching sensation, I'll be put into so much trouble after it, so if one is <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> little sober, he'll better suffer this itching sensation than to take the responsibility. This is the <span class="Italic">sastric</span> injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this (indistinct) In the world I have come to know mostly, I have never seen any, except the word is a true couple. They are married means sex life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Except devotees, which after contacting, I haven't seen any (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the whole world is going on. Married life means legalized prostitution. That is their philosophy. So therefore they are, in the Western world, they do not like to marry. And this is also prostitution; that is also prostitution. So let us go on with our illegal prostitution. Why legal prostitution? This is the philosophy. And that is the Freud philosophy. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Even Indians, the same. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Indians, European, doesn't matter. The whole human society is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> His idea is why should we make this sex life so cumbersome by marriage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Avoid it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's a natural thing just to have sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You are following your principles, the four principles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Avoid it. They are regularly advertising. I have seen in Dallas, "topless, bottomless," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know.

"Never mind, we shall be punished." You'll become dog. "Oh what is the wrong if I become a dog?" They say like that, "What is the wrong?" He thinks that "I'll get good facilities for sex. There will be no need of apartment. I'll save the rent. To become a dog and have sex life on the street, it is good facility." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I have some few questions which I have come here to ask. Permit me to ask, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that question? Who can answer.</div>
