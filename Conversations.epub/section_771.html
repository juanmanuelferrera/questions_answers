<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We should give the... We have two life members there. I've done this before. Give the price for one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of bricks in advance and we get twenty rupees off. That way they'll give you the full supply. So in one month we can get all the bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they want advance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Because then they get the twenty rupees off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Per thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> They want advance because they have so many expenses for labors and they just started producing. It's helps them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty rupees per thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> That means over two and a half thousand you save five thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to advance two and a half thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No. We have to advance about thirty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To save five thousand you have to advance thirty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> You get all the supply within one month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Then they have no money. They want to manufacture with our money. Is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Well, then they'll supply at full price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if they cannot supply, why shall I give advance? You take... You give us supply and take money. [break] ...take. Advance you take. Whatever he will be able to supply, say, within a week, you take one-fourth advance. Then take payment immediately as you supply. [break] ...of this?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Would you like to see the <span class="Italic">gośālā</span> or the boat today, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which side is boat? Straight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Boat is at Hulor Ghat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Boat is worth seeing. (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He's the only one who gives out fish <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Even the <span class="Italic">ricksaw</span> drivers don't take his <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> They say it is unclean. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lady?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> In this house here. There's one lady lives here. One of the devotees was walking. He said she hears the <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> at night. One widow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Books also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Doesn't it get wet down there, though, Jayapatāka?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> There's another floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And also up front, behind Bhavānanda Mahārāja, is also another storage which goes all the way up to the front of the ship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These seats go folding down also when not in use. They can go up or down.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The <span class="Italic">maji</span> who we purchased the boat from said it can go to Indonesia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No, he said... He went to Purī first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that <span class="Italic">maji</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> He went to Orissa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is the <span class="Italic">maji</span>? He went?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It was another man in Diamond Harbor who said they would go to Indonesia. <span class="Italic">Maji</span>... They have been to Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He went to Orissa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> His father owned the boat. We bought from him. His son was the <span class="Italic">maji,</span> so we kept him as the <span class="Italic">maji.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) So let us go. Which way? This way or that way? The same way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Same way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> This will take about two, three more days to finish painting. Then it will be ready. The Deities will be going just here on one platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Up? People can also sit up. So it will be very nice to sit up on the top. We're making one special stair for all that. [break] ...cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...men you are going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That boat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Twelve, fifteen men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that can be easily accommodated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Oh, yes. We could accommodate even twenty men. But that will be easy to accommodate, just twelve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Don't take many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> You want to walk back the same way or a different way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different? There is different way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> There's one path this way. But that's longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Longer. No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] ...should like to install the Deities for the program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? If I am here, I can do. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">...kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This land belonged to Śrīdhara Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> It belonged to Śrīdhara Mahārāja. I think he sold it off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...not doing anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No money, probably. [break] ...crane comes here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For the big temple, big crane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will immediately silence them. Big crane rolling in that can be seen. The crane will be bigger than any other temple that's already built here. [break] ...engineer from Larson and Tubro who came to meet you in Bombay? He says that they've built one building now, the tallest building in India. It's a thirty-five-story building. It's over three hundred foot high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Where is that? Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Air India building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe that's the one. What is the size of the Caitanya Matha? That's the biggest one here? The biggest in Bengal? The Caitanya Matha temple, a hundred and ten foot, is the biggest temple in Bengal. There's not many big temples here... But that church is bigger in Chowringhee. I think that church that the British built...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chowringhee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Near Victoria Memorial, that church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. St. Paul's Cathedral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that's higher than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Oh, yes, that's big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Also in Krishnanagar, big Catholic church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Five minutes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> ...festival devotees will pay one rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Such a short walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? They should come by walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, unless someone is carrying something heavy or is invalid, they shouldn't ride.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They should pass that rule, you know, Jayapatāka? If they're told they can't, then they won't do it, if they're told they shouldn't. One reason might be that it becomes a little hot at that time of the year, so the heat of the day, maybe it's too much for them. Actually, there was a suggestion made by a number of GBC men that they wanted to request you that in future years that the festival could be held ending on Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's appearance day rather than beginning, the reason being that in America the months of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is system here also. The festival begins before the birthday and ends on the birthday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their suggestion wanted to be that the entire festival, including Vṛndāvana and everything, should precede this because in America beginning about mid-March, especially April, is the best months for preaching in colleges and other places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So you can arrange like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And furthermore, here it gets a little hot. This would give us the coolest months, February.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And February is the worst time for book distribution in the West, whereas March, April is a good time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them... So they may come in February.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In future years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will be very much appreciated by everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not too cold in Vṛndāvana? I don't think so. End of February is not cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeṣa:</span> For Westerners it's not cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Westerners are accustomed to that. They'll like it. They'll prefer it. They won't mind. They can't take the heat. Vṛndāvana is very cold in mid-February, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not. Vṛndāvana is very cold December-January.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeṣa:</span> At night. At night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are accustomed to it. They can tolerate it. The hot part is more intolerable for Americans. It's really a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeṣa:</span> It's colder than sixty degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The college preaching in the month of April is the very best. [break] Do you think something could be written on this wall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> pavilion wall...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...used for fuel. This crust, this, that can be used for burning. Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] When dismantling will begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When will the dismantling begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This gentleman, he will do that. He can do it immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda said it can begin immediately. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...are standing properly? These walls, they are standing in right angle? This wall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I think so, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have measured?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Standing up properly on the boundary of the land, you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Vertically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I saw the masons measuring when they bricked it, but I never measured myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What do you think might be wrong, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, in due course of time, it'll fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee (1):</span> You mean the foundation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No the wall, if it is like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> If it is leaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have not tested it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> I have seen while they were laying the bricks they were testing all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeṣa:</span> It seems to be leaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> In the future I'll pers...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> From this corner we can see. [break] ...stores. You suggest <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> from one of the stores.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> How is the best way to do that? Like in Jag... They are doing? A small...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Like Jagannātha Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, small basis, you can begin. All these rooms are being utilized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> These are cement godown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If this walk is lined with those bottle plums, as you suggested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It'll be very attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Nellore, that house we were staying at had that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So bottle plums can be purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not do? [break]...ing in their health?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. (<span class="Italic">Gurukula kīrtana</span> party, chanting, meets Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...like they are doing in so many other places?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You spend it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Just like the Tirupati temple. They have got crores and crores of rupees in the bank, so government has borrowed twenty crores of rupees for improving the worship (?) If we spend the money as soon as it's made, then they won't take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The reason the government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That was the purpose of my Trust making: fifty percent immediately spent for printing, fifty percent building-no money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bank balance, zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is my program. You get money: you spend money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Make one million and the next day be with nil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Brahminical qualification. Whatever he gets, he spends. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Those in ISKCON who (?) haven't spent money, they got in trouble. Like, in Germany they stored money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, storing is not good. Some money may be, few <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> stored for emergency. Otherwise the principle should be to get money and spend money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually in Tirupati, one of the reasons the government took over is that the trustees themselves were squandering the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is everywhere.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> There was one question in class this morning about Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, and in your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> you say that this is the smallest universe. So I questioned whether if this is the smallest universe, and Jayapatāka said that in other universes there's more volumes of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Would that mean that Kṛṣṇa manifests more pastimes in the higher universes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is unlimited. Why do you limit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So is the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> compiled in the same way in other universes? Vyāsadeva compiles it like he does in this universe as well?</div>

So, similarly other planet, other, other...There are unlimited fields. You cannot count. Why you try to count it, "How many universes? How many devotees?" That is foolishness. It is not possible. Wherever you start, everything is unlimited. Can you count how many atoms are there, atomic? That is your limitation. Therefore I say "frog philosophy." The limited wants to study the unlimited. That is frog philosophy. The frog is thinking, "Eh? Three feet. All right, four feet. All right, five feet." He cannot think unlimited because he is frog. So don't imitate the frog. Take it as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Then it is all right. So what we are getting from this banana garden?</div>
