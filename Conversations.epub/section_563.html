<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...the history of Sunday, Monday, Tuesday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not Monday first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> God created the earth, in the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> God started on a Monday. He created the earth. It says in the Bible in the <span class="Italic">Old Testament</span> that it took Him seven days, or six days, and on the seventh day He rested. But still there is some dispute whether He started on a Sunday or a Monday. So the Jewish, the Hebrews, they hold the Sabbath on a Saturday, and the Christians and the Catholics they have the Sabbath on the Sunday. But on the seventh day God rested after creating the heavens and the earths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It was always very bad to engage in any type of work on the Sabbath day. It was used only to glorify the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> For fishing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Not any more. Now the post office is closed on Saturday and open all day on Sunday in Perth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. They are open on the Sabbath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is: if the moon is the first planet nearer, why they did not start Monday? If the sun is after, then Sunday. This is the proof that first sun, then moon, not that first moon and then sun. Hm? That is the description in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> One after another, one after another. Sixteen thousand, sixteen hundred thousand miles apart. First of all sun, then moon, then, what is called? Mars. You have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Mars is above the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But the scientists wouldn't even agree that the sun is the first created thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is accepting them as scientists? You can accept them. Why Sunday first? Wherefrom they have gotten?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That was gotten from Greek mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then Greek, where they got it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Some of the days are named after different demigods. Wednesday is named after a god named Woden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where they got these demigods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> From Greek mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Greek mythology, that's all right. But where they got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they say they made it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But all knowledge comes from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Greek history is about three thousand years. [break] ...During the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣit's grandson. Mahārāja Parīkṣit was the grandson of Yudhiṣṭhira, and Yudhiṣṭhira ruled over five thousand years ago. So the Yayāti... Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's grandson is Parīkṣit. His son is Janamejaya. And his son is Yayāti. And his son started Greek and Roman Empire. So therefore the Greek history is not more than three thousand years. Mahārāja Yayāti banished his two sons to the European quarters. <span class="Italic">Mleccha-yavana.</span> Later on they became <span class="Italic">yavana,</span> from Vedic culture deviated. This is the history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He sent them there for conquering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No. He gave him, that "You take that place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh. "This is your kingdom."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Every, all world was emperor, the Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira and the family. <span class="Italic">Sa-sāgara. Sa-sāgara</span> means "including all the oceans." That means the whole world. There was one flag only during the time of Mahārāja Parīkṣit. And he first saw the cow-killing maybe in Africa or in Arabia. One black man was trying to kill a cow, and Mahārāja Parīkṣit was on tour, and immediately he punished him. That is Kali. The black man means Africa. Or where other place, black men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Some of the, there are some natives in Asia also, southeast Asia, that are black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arabia? No. Arabians are not black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Not... Generally they're not so black. Indonesians are black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Africa is about the only place other than some islands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Africa is black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Aborigines here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They have black natives here also, Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all descendant of the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Did the Greek civilization follow the Vedic culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They were worshiping demigods from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But they didn't have a very high standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These, these Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> there is mention of so many demigods, how they were born. You do not know the meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No, we are just chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How, one after another, how one is born out of the... That is... How the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> were there, <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> were there-everything in Vedic... These Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> means the history of human society. And the origin is God, Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa. There are other <span class="Italic">mantras</span> wherein it is stated, <span class="Italic">eko nārāyaṇa āsīt.</span> "Only Nārāyaṇa was there." Neither Lord Śiva nor Brahmā. Later on, they came. When he first cites the <span class="Italic">mantra, vande mahā-puruṣa te caraṇāravindam, śiva-viriñci-nutam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 11.5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span> Śiva means Lord Śiva, and <span class="Italic">viriñci</span> means Brahmā. All of them offer respect to Nārāyaṇa. Indian astrology was taken by the Arabians first. The one, two, three, four, five, six, these figures were taken from India, up to nine, then zero. Then you make all mathematical, arithmetical calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The Arabic numerals came from India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all they took the one, two, three, four, five, six, seven...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The Romans had a very complicated system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) If you write 1975 it will become so big. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yeah. Some twenty letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This "Sunday, Monday," means first sun, then moon. Where they are going? They are going to hell, not in the moon. This Vedic description is right. Because first study, Sunday... That, we offer <span class="Italic">gāyatrī</span> to the sun. So the moon is after the sun-this is the proof, first Sunday, then Monday. So if their calculation is 93,000,000 miles from here, and moon is (sic:) one million, six thousand still farther, then where they are going? If they simply follow strictly this moon expedition and they admit they have not gone, then the whole civilization will change. All wrong conclusion. But they will have to admit now. Now they are serious, and they will have to say that they've never gone to the moon. And they will have to continue this. Otherwise they will be farce before the world. They will have to continue it. Now they are in such a position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They can't just stop and say, "OK, now we..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they stop, then they are failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah. And then everyone will complain, "Oh, you wasted billions of dollars."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if they go, then they will have the right information. But they will never be able to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like Rāvaṇa could not reach the heavenly planets just by building the staircase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was his only demonic proposal, that "We make staircase." He said that "Why you are undergoing so much austerities to go to the heavenly planets? I shall make a staircase. You will go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> How high did he make it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He never attempted. He simply bluffed, that's all. So demons' proposals are like that. Therefore it is a common say in, hearsay in the, in India, that <span class="Italic">rāvaṇe sarge sini</span>(?): "The proposal is just like Rāvaṇa proposed to make a staircase to the heavenly planets." He was also very much advanced materially, very prosperous materially. Gold was very common thing. He brought gold from Brazil through the subway. His brother was king there, in southern America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Kumbhakarṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Mahīrāvaṇa. <span class="Italic">Mahī, mahī</span> means the earth. He used to go through the subway, through the earth. So other side there was another Rāvaṇa. That is Mahīrāvaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He built the subway?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The subway is still there, Brazil. Somebody said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they found some parts of a subway there, some big tunnel. But they don't know where it goes, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That is from Ceylon to Brazil, subway. And Rāvaṇa's civilization, Rāmacandra's fight, some millions of years ago. That is in the Tretā-yuga. The duration of Kali-yuga<span class="Italic"> </span>is about, say, four <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of years. And Dvāpara-yuga, eight <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of years. And then Tretā-yuga, twelve <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> About two millions years ago, Tretā-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, why? Twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span>, ah, two million, yes. Two millions of years ago the Rāvaṇa's civilization was there, and he was so prosperous. He had airplane. The zeplin, zeplin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Jet plane?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not jet, zeplin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, with the air and gas inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His son's name was Meghadūta. He was flying above the cloud. Therefore his name was Megha. <span class="Italic">Megha</span> means cloud. They were so much advanced in civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What kind of civilization was in South America at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same like. Therefore these Mexicans, South American, they resemble therefore almost Indian body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They also eat food... They eat a food similar to the <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Tortillas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi,</span> in Middle East also they eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, in Lebanon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Tehran we saw those big <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Six feet long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so big. One <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi</span> is sufficient for the whole family. They are sold in market, purchased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Very cheaply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Only three or four cents apiece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't make much profit. That is the oriental culture. They make little profit; they are satisfied. Still in India you will find many hotel, very cheap, very cheap. Especially Mohammedan hotels. Still, by paying eight annas, you can get full meal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> When Rāvaṇa was on the earth, was the whole earth populated, like Brazil and also the other parts of the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere population. This is a new theory of the rascals that there was no civilization before three thousand years. This is wrong theory. Everything was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So when Mahārāja Yayāti banished his sons to those kingdoms, they were already populated there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They seem to be pretty much <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> races.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And during Kurukṣetra fight, all different kings joined, either to this party or that party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, from all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was first-grade world war, Kurukṣetra. There is the one king, Śaibya, he came from Śibiya. Where is Śibiya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Siberia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śibiya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, Śibiya? That's Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, maybe there. There were... All the kings of the world, they joined, either this party or that party. Friends, friendly countries, they joined. Just like Kṛṣṇa. He personally joined Arjuna, but He gave His soldiers to Duryodhana. It was family war. So the friends divided, "I will join you." It was sporting. For the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> fighting is sporting. They have football match. They did not take it as enmities. Just in the evening they are friends. This party goes to that party, that party goes to... It is a decision, who will be king, that's all. Test of strength. Actually it was not enmity. "Let us fight, and who is strong he will be king, that's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And the losers will go to the heavenly planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyone who dies in such fight, he goes to heavenly planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So they were not afraid of dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? They knew. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am not going to die after the annihilation of this body." It was a common understanding. Not that such a man, big man, director, he says, "No, no, I don't believe in the soul." (chuckles) Therefore I said the fourth-class man. In India still, even a common man, uneducated farmer, he believes. He believes. He believes in God. He believes in transmigration. He believes in his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> These things which will take thousands of years to be learned by the Westerners, even the common man knows still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And all Kṛṣṇa's soldiers were killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> So Kṛṣṇa fought against His own soldiers also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa did not fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But He led the fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was chariot driver at the risk of being killed. The other party may kill the chariot driver to stop the progress of the enemy. They kill. They kill the horses, they kill the charioteer, then the person. So Kṛṣṇa took the risk of being killed. Bhīṣma attacked Him. He pierced His body with arrows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think the tribes in South America, the Aztecs, they were also worshipers of the sun-god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They had very much gold. And the Spanish, they came and plundered the gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The aborigines here, they have got any religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here in Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, they mostly worship ghosts and spirits, I think. Trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūtejyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is religion. <span class="Italic">Yānti bhūtāni bhūtejyā.</span> What is this "UJV"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That is the license plate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. What is the... Generally, the city's name are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, it usually has a U before the initials. I don't know why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Generally, they make them all-each one is a little bit different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Was Mahīrāvaṇa also a demon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What happened to him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was killed by Rāmacandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He was called by his brother, wasn't he...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> ...to Ceylon in the battle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he made a plan to kill Rāmacandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Rāmacandra made a plan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Mahīrāvaṇa. And in that plan he was killed. [break] That is Indo-European civilization. The kings came from India, and he developed. Therefore it is called Indo-European civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The scientists and the archaeologists are very amazed to find the structures, the buildings that they had in their civilization. They can't understand how they were built, such huge pillars and gigantic stones. They don't know how they were put into place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, the Jagannātha temple is also like that. They suggest that they manufacture, and then they surround with sand, then further manufacture. And when it is complete the sand is taken away. Otherwise how it is put into...? The sand is stacked just like this. The temple is being manufactured, and the sand is thrown all side, and when it is finished, the sand is taken away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The temple is manufactured in the sand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, as usual. Just like they dig well. They dig well. They begin immediately, and then you dig the earth, and the structure goes down. Then again, then again, like that. They were experts, they were experts, to construct... Labor is cheap. That time, practically there was no labor cost. At the present moment, on account of factories, the labor cost has increased. Otherwise the laborers, they were, they have no sufficient employment. So two annas, four annas. I was paying labor, four annas, say, in 1930s. Four annas. In Allahabad I was paying four annas. He would work whole day. In Bombay eight annas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They also have the big structures in Egypt, the pyramids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Perhaps they used sand also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The Greeks say that they built their buildings... They hired some very big men called cyclopses, big giants. And they came and built all the buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And such stories are in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> also. The demons were engaged, giants and demons, for construction. Yes. And they were very good artist, how to do it. Now we employ the first-class men, so-called first-class engineering, but they were meant for the demons and giants. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, that explains how they built such fantastic temples and palaces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Some people say, "Why don't we see any giants any more today?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the Africa, there were many giants, very high, very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span>. Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Africa some of the natives, very big, eight feet tall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very tall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In South America also, they used to have the Amazons, a big race.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Didn't one demon construct a big parliament house for Kṛṣṇa? That demon Māyā? For King Yudhiṣṭhira?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Umm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Aṣṭa-siddhi dāsa, when he came back from Fiji he told us a story that the local people say that Kāliya snake, after he ran away, he lives in Fiji in a big lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> On top of a mountain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was driven away from Vṛndāvana. (pause) They are all going to the downtown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. To the factory areas also, in Freemantle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Where is the factory area?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> About ten miles down the coast. They have very big factories, very bad pollution. Big factories down south, in one place called Freemantle. It's a little way down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three miles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten miles. How long it will take to go and come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> To the factory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It takes about one hour to go down there. Three quarters of an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One hour? For ten miles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's a lot of traffic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What factories they have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Big, big steel factories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Steel factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. Also aluminium factories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aluminium. And still, there is problem. That man said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. He said the bauxite mineral, the multinational or international companies are exploiting, interested in exploiting the bauxite minerals to make much aluminium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now aluminium is in great demand for manufacturing airplane. They are all manufactured from aluminium. (someone shouts in distance) What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I think he was barking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just a <span class="Italic">rākṣasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> When we walk in the city in Perth the young people, many people, they say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." They say, "Oh, there is Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a newspaper clipping in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Oh, yes, that is mine. It was about three years ago, three or four years ago. They put one article. Amogha was supposed to come over from Sydney. I was not even a devotee then, but still, they put this article that there were three devotees in Perth chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That was because I was going to Indonesia and I stopped here on the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Many people in Perth, they have the books. About one and a half years ago we were over here and we were distributing the big <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> books and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are not distributing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, we are still distributing, only around Christmas in Perth. During the rest of the time of the year, it is not very crowded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> When we came over here, we stayed in a hotel before we found the house about ten days ago. And when we came to the motel, the lady said, "Oh, someone has left this book here." And she gave us a <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> (pause) Yesterday the United States attacked and sank three Cambodian boats. They are fighting because the Cambodian Communists, the new government, captured one United States freighter. So now they are beginning to try to take it back. (pause) The bus is empty again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A very good bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Practically every one of these cars only has one person in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So actually, they have not advanced technologically from the civilizations of Rāvaṇa's time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not civilization. Technological advancement is not civilization. It is the advancement of <span class="Italic">ugra</span> knowledge. Real civilization is to advance in Brahman knowledge. If there are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> that is advancement. This is not advancement because they do not know what is advancement. They have no knowledge that "I have to die, and I have to accept another body after death." They do not know it. So long this body is there, they are trying to have very comfortable position. But they do not know that after this body, he has to accept another body. So how this technology will help him? If, in this life, by technological advancement you live very comfortably, and next life you become a dog, then where is the advancement? That they do not know. Suppose... We have got visa for two weeks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three weeks. Now, if in Perth I begin one big skyscraper building and then after three weeks I am kicked out, then is that very good intelligence? I know that I shall remain here for three weeks, and if I begin one skyscraper building, and then, during the time of constructing or, say, after the construction is finished, I am kicked out, then where is that intelligence? Just like Napoleon. He wanted to construct that arch. You have not seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he could not finish it. So this is his intelligence. Such a big man, Napoleon, that is his intelligence. And what to speak of others. Everyone knows that "I will have to die," and when death will come, nobody knows. At any moment it may come. So he will not be able to enjoy what he is doing, but still, he is doing. And his real business is forgotten. His real business is to stop his birth and death process and go back to home, back to Godhead. That is his real business. He does not know the real... Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">mūḍhas. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it is a civilization of the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> fourth-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Should the devotees think that "Any moment, I can die"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a fact. Why they will think? It is a fact. There is English proverb, "There is many dangers between the cups and the lips." You are going to drink tea. The distance is: here is cup and here is lip. There may be many dangers. So suppose in drinking tea there is some choking within the throat, and coughing, you may die immediately. You are so much under the control of nature. Little mistake will cause your death, little mistake. And conditioned life means we commit mistake, we are illusioned, we cheat, and our knowledge is imperfect. This is conditioned life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I telephoned that geographer yesterday to talk to him, and he said that "What Swamiji said was true, but how can...?" He said, "It will be very difficult to apply because most people, they are not interested." But he says it was very... He could understand that was true, what you were saying. He may also come again to talk more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let him come. Let him come. People may take or not take, but he is inquisitive gentleman. Let him understand. People... We are preaching. Who is taking? Mass of people, they are not taking it. But still, we are doing that. That is our duty. People may take or not take, but a God's servant must speak the truth. Just like Jesus Christ. He was crucified. Nobody took his words. But he did it. If people would have accepted his philosophy, then why he was crucified by the judges? It was done by the judges, Roman judges. So this is the position of the world. Socrates was killed because he said that there is soul. This is the defect of Western civilization. They want <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> What is that <span class="Italic">vox populi</span>? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Bauxite?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vox populi.</span> You know this word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yeah, Latin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Latin, yes. People's vote. The people may be asses, but still, their votes will be taken, the <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> The fourth-class, fifth-class men, and they are giving vote. And the mistake is detected. Just like this Nixon was voted and the mistake was detected. But still, they follow the same process, <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> What is the value of the votes of the fourth-class, fifth-class men? Better one intelligent man, if he knows things, if he is liberated, if he says, "This is right," that should be taken. That is Vedic civilization. We are accepting Kṛṣṇa. We are not accepting the <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> One person, the Supreme, that's all. This is our process. We don't accept <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> All these Vedic literature are accepted not on the people's vote, but who is presenting? Vyāsadeva is presenting, Kṛṣṇa is presenting. Parāśara Muni is presenting. Therefore they are accepted. You cannot expect the mass of people very intelligent. That is not possible. So what is the value of their votes if they are not intelligent?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">But in the Western countries this is the disease, <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> Socrates said there is soul, and he was killed because <span class="Italic">vox populi</span> was against. Christ was killed because <span class="Italic">vox populi</span> was against. This is the defect of the Western civilization. During the lifetime of Christ, nobody accepted. When he was killed, or crucified, then the other saintly persons, they gave their experience, what they learned from Jesus Christ. Christ could not give any words. Some sporadic words were there, and the Bible was made on that basis. Actually, the Bible is not the word, directly words of Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That must be why it says... It says, "The Gospel according to John," "The Gospel according to Mark."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Even his disciples denounced him when they were going to crucify him. They said, "Oh, I do not know Jesus."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...they are after zeros. Caitanya Mahāprabhu sa..., <span class="Italic">śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me. Śūnyāyitam</span> means zero. [break] Advancement of civilization is zero. If you add many thousands of zero, does the value increases?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It remains zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Big zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be one. Then it will increase the value. That one, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, will make this material civilization hundred times important. And without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are all zeros. [break] ...next life, supposing hypothetically I am going to be a dog, then what is this civilization? But that you cannot say, "No, I am not going to be dog," because you do not know. You are under the, completely under the grip of material nature. And there are cats and dogs. How you can guarantee that you are not going to be a dog? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> You will get another body. So how you can say that "No, I am not going to be a dog"? You cannot say; you are not independent. You cannot make your choice. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> By your work, it will be decided by higher authorities. Then how you can say, "No, no, I am not... There is no life, there is no..." It is all nonsense. Therefore without this knowledge, all this material opulence, it is all zero. It may be some fact for fifty or sixty years, but the world is not for fifty or sixty years, for millions and millions of years. (end)</div>
