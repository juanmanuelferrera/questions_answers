<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Nārada, but still they are sinful. Such a great personality like Nārada, they had seen, but still they are sinful. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "As such, the great sage Nārada considered that because the demigods Nalakūvara and Maṇigrīva were so infatuated by false prestige, they should be put in a condition of life devoid of opulence." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...bench, standing. The small children, they are punished, "Stand up on the bench." It is like that.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything, there are three qualities, everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> More <span class="Italic">rajas</span> is in monkeys because they are more active. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are researching for something which is useless. Therefore <span class="Italic">tamas. Rajas-tamo-bhavaḥ kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye [SB </span>1.2.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the effect of <span class="Italic">rajas tamas: kāma</span> and <span class="Italic">lobha,</span> greedy and always hankering after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sometimes real scientists speak out the truth. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Generally it is seen that one who has risen from a poverty-stricken life and becomes wealthy creates some charitable institution at the end of his life..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...goes to market and gets some of this... What is called, <span class="Italic">bhūta bhūta?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why I say that <span class="Italic">rasanā</span> (tongue) is not so strong as <span class="Italic">śiṣṇa</span> (genital).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you do not allow <span class="Italic">rasanā</span> to enjoy much, <span class="Italic">śiṣṇa</span> will be subdued.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But still, I mean personally, for myself, I don't have any taste for any food. In fact I have been taking all the food together just like the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and I don't have any taste. But still I have from within me I don't find that form of sex carrying out even though I am a scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to say that "Sex life is so strong that even if I see one wooden female form I become excited."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I feel the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is not unnatural. Caitanya Mahāprabhu tells this because this cannot be avoided. But by knowledge it can be avoided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We were talking the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by knowledge. Yes. But "Because I am excited, therefore I have to do this," that is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then I found out the solution for this. As soon as you feel excitement... [break] Then you have nothing to do with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That I have started practicing this for some time. And I feel a great solace in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has been recommended by Śaṅkarācārya, that "Why you are attracted by these forms? It is only a combination of flesh and marrow. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but who is attracted? The <span class="Italic">indriya</span> is attracted. I am beyond <span class="Italic">indriya.</span> That also you think. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long we are associated... The example I have given many times, that I am sitting on a car, and the car there is accident. I am not car. Still, I am excited, "Oh, my car is lost. Why you have struck my car?" There is so much quarrel. But it is a fact, he knows that "I am not the car." That is called <span class="Italic">abhiniveśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Wrong orientation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">matṛvat para-dareṣu:</span> "Always think of other's wife as mother."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...also have to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We die, don't mind, but we want others to die as Muslims. We want to die them as Hindus. [break] ...Supersonic sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supersonic, what is that? Any circumstance, the ruling power is nature. He cannot avoid that. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...more their senses are turbulent. This is also... Therefore there is one <span class="Italic">tapasā brahmacāryena [SB </span>6.1.13] and the word <span class="Italic">anaśana, anaśana,</span> "not eating." Eating should be reduced.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...not very turbulent, he cannot become violent." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...yuktāhāra.</span> Not to eat more, not to eat less. That is required. [break] ...when I was alone in Baroda, I was making my customers for <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> So I entered one gentleman's house and from the porch he was, "Don't come! Don't come! Don't come!" (laughs) Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Baroda was a very small place then. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...if I go to place, <span class="Italic">jataji bhikṣā dijiye,</span> so everyone will be compassionate. And it is our duty, at least in Vedic civilization, that when a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> comes he is received. <span class="Italic">Aiye, mahārāja, betiye.</span> Still. Still in the villages they do that. Just like it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> should be taken as the sons of the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Poona, even today in Poona... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trained like that, very good. [break] It is compulsory that every man should become a mendicant for some time.</div>

They become <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> for one month. There are hundreds and thousands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is called "one month <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" That is not mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> but it has come into custom.
