<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They eat even stool. Just like hogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also a human being does. You know in concentration camp in second war they had to eat their stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the British army had a regulation that they could drink urine but not stool. They cannot eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may make regulation, but necessity has no regulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I.... because I happen to be.... I, I was holding the honorary position of a colonel in the army...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, "I am making law: you can drink urine." Just see what is the position. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In difficulty if there is no water, you can drink your own urine, but you cannot eat your stool. It is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I drink urine, still I will have to be punished. By the law. I'm drinking urine, and because I have violated law, I will have to be punished. This is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is, sir, one matter in <span class="Italic">Ayurvedas, svayāmbu cikitsā,</span> wherein people are drinking their own urine, because urine is not only water and waste products but there are certain broken, I mean what you call important articles, of body maintainence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those.... You are advising your patients to go and drink...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I don't say. But that is not so bad, because it contains those hormones.... (Prabhupāda breaks in laughing) It does contain the hormones, I mean it has been analyzed like that, scientifically. It is not to be joked about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is analyzed. And stool is full of hydrophosphites. Yes, that is another.... Stool is full of hydrophosphites.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi to another man) They are bringing.... There is a matter in <span class="Italic">cikitsā</span> in <span class="Italic">Ayurveda. Svayāmbu. </span>What is that called? So, Mr.... our er, Mr. Desai. Morarji...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And look at him. He's so, I mean, so absolutely healthy. I mean it is, we should not laugh about it, but there is something right in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I don't laugh; I am surprised! (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, we are surprised. I also, I also was surprised first, but then it is not so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa! Thank you very much (to passerby) Who is your devotee daughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Janice. Jani! (calling to passing man) His mother was so much great devotee, she died only at the age of ninety-eight years. When she was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> His mother. She was dying, and she said, "I don't want to see anybody; bring only Kṛṣṇa's photo before me." (Hindi to other man) No, no. His mother-Mr. Jani's. And then looking at the photograph of Kṛṣṇa, she breathed her last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw in Delhi one old man, just a few minutes before his death he asked his son to bring Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa picture, and it was put before him, and he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And my father died saying <span class="Italic">oṁ tat sat śrī-kṛṣṇāya namaḥ,</span> and then he stopped it, breathing, in the morning at six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> Morning, that is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, six o'clock. And my wife was daily saying <span class="Italic">bhaja govindam, bhaja govindam</span> before she died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (to devotees) Just see: <span class="Italic">govindam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Hm. That <span class="Italic">bhaja govindam</span> she was very fond of. Śaṅkarācārya's <span class="Italic">bhaja govindaṁ, bhaja govindaṁ...</span> When I used to talk about Sanskrit literature, she said "Why do I want to know grammar? <span class="Italic">Bhaja govindam</span> is all right for me." She said. Hm? <span class="Italic">...Stubhyāṁ bhagavate vāsudevaya</span> I don't know how many thousands of times, for the whole day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My father never did any work in all his life. Never. He had some estate, and then he lost it also. We are big <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> and he lost all the land and property in various forms of business. And after that he only was sitting in the temple all the day and saying <span class="Italic">hari-nāma.</span> All his life, from the age of forty years till he died at age of eighty, he did that. My mother died when he was thirty-two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very early. And he never married again, and I was the only son and no other daughter or son. Many people requested him to marry, but he said no, he would not marry, because one son is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">putradi (?) bhāgya. Putra,</span> when there is <span class="Italic">putra,</span> what is the use of marriage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was five years old when my mother died. In that big, pandemic of influenza in 1918, that..., that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, war influenza, after war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> After war. The whole world was (indistinct). [break] What you do for the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not remember God, he remembered his son. But God is so kind, because he uttered God's name, He took it seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That Mr. Shah had gone to the States and came back from there, some three months back, and he praised the Americans, that no man on Sunday is in the street. All of them are in the churches, and you hear on the radio only those hymns. Is it a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is American. (indicates Harikeśa)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but nobody listens to the radio.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He says that at least government does it. Here government is giving all the cinema. And there the churches are overflowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In London I have seen almost all the churches are vacant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> On Sundays? I don't know now. When I was a student I used to see them full, overflowing practically. Because they were beaten down by war very recently, they did not forget God then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> On Sundays they're pretty full. For a couple of hours they're pretty full.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then in the afternoon they're vacant. That's when they get their big collection, big collection on Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, everywhere it is the church which has actually distorted the message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is the church which has distorted the message. You see the Christ's message is distorted by the church; our Kṛṣṇa's message is distorted by our temples, sort of a thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why temples? Even your big, big political leaders, they distort. By do you blame the temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But Christianity is distorted by the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...those popes. However, Christ taught <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma,</span> absolute <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> It is this creation of the church, really to my mind, that the Christ is forgotten by the Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is remembering your Kṛṣṇa in this country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There are a few people. I, we are not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bombay, there are so many roads, "Vivekananda road." But there is no Kṛṣṇa Road. Hm? Who is remembering Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is Kṛṣṇa Art Gallery, in market. Kṛṣṇa Art Gallery. (laughing) (Hindi conversation with man about Kṛṣṇa's name) Ajāmila spoke "Nārāyaṇa." You may speak in the name of your father, that his called name. Heḥ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a chance; that is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> Now the Air India's plane, they have <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-līlā</span> pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> In Air India plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sense enjoyment. Only Rādhārāṇī and Kṛṣṇa. And when Kṛṣṇa is killing Kaṁsa, that picture is.... Killing Kaṁsa, that picture you won't find. Kṛṣṇa is embracing <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> "Ah, that is very nice!" (laughter) Because "We are doing the same thing, we are following Kṛṣṇa." That is their purpose. They are very much fond of Kṛṣṇa's mixing with the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> because they get a support, that "What we are doing..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "We are following Kṛṣṇa!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These rascals, they have taken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But this, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will never paint any picture of Kṛṣṇa is killing Pūtāna, Aghasura, Bakasura, Kaṁsa-so many killing process from the very childhood. That picture you won't find. Because he knows he is Aghasura. He'll be killed. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We see pictures of Giridhārī, like that. Now we see even Giridhārī picture. Sir, it is the education. The disturb the education of this country after Neccola (?). That is the cause of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naḥ, Necolla(?) has gone long, long ago. What you are doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Necolla(?) have made it sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can change it. That Necolla(?) has conquered you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. They did conquer us. These priests even are not tending even the system of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravaṇānanda:</span> At the Ramakrishna Mission school in Madras near a football field, there is one slogan on the arch that says, "The playing of football will bring one closer to heaven than the study of the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Has Neccolla(?) carved this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravaṇānanda:</span> He said, "Tear up all the big <span class="Italic">tulasīs...</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Is it a fact? We don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a fact if he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravaṇānanda:</span> Yes. It is written right there, it's written right there. They say the playing of football will bring one closer to heaven than the study of the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Vivekananda taught this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravaṇānanda:</span> He said "Pull out the <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> and plant <span class="Italic">brinjal.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he advised, better water what is called, eggplant tree, than <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> tree. It will bring some fruit. What is the use of watering <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Tulasi</span> has got great medicinal properties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he is not even prepared to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He must not be knowing. Those rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And "Why you are searching out God here and there? There are so many Gods loitering in the street." This is the Vivekananda's statement. And therefore everyone is God. Everyone is thinking, "I am God." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravaṇānanda:</span> When we went to try to arrange a lecture at their football field for a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> program, they said all the people coming would ruin the turf for cricket season. So they didn't have time for spiritual training, they said, only for the physical training. It caused too much damage on the field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In my school, sir, where I was educated, in the entrance there is a statue of Sarasvatī, and nearby there is a photograph of Kṛṣṇa. I don't know how it came, that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All are not like that. In my school where I was educated, secondary school, in the entrance there was a statue of Sarasvatī, and near that was Kṛṣṇa's photo. (pause) (someone shouts Hare Kṛṣṇa)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In good health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He always runs like this. All the time. He is so much frightened of his wife in the house that he cannot speak a word. Still he is in the house. That is why he makes good of the things when he comes out. (laughs) He behaves so naughtily like that. (Hindi with one man) Sir, shall we go this way, if you don't mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Mr. Punja is staying? From Fiji? He has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, no, he hasn't come back yet. He had two days' business, he said. He said he would come after that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...doing there, these slums?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This was, they wanted to, er, have a officer of customs. The public, I mean, objected to, because they are imposing upon them, the way of the public walking. So they stopped it, but they are not taking away all these walls. Otherwise where the poor fellows will make the hutments?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is what they are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) The municipality has no objection. (Hindi with other man) Therefore Gandhi says that he does not give away these poor people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they are in the hands of the empire lost? Why they lost their empire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they were shortsighted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how they knew?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they knew how to govern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is not government, if you lose after all. What is this government? You must govern in such a way that you will never lose it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, sir, we also had an empire, India, and we have lost it, haven't we? And we, all the eastern country, Malaya, Java, Sumatra, and all those things. Why we lost it? <span class="Italic">Kālena!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kālena</span> of course. So when you lose your culture, then you lose everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. Because they did not see with the same eye all people. They were the rascals. (indistinct) ...a very good race. After all, we are Aryans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aryans means to follow Vedic instructions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have forgotten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Aryans. So they are now the same thing. A person born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, he is claiming "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" Similarly, even though born in Aryan family, without any culture they are claiming "I am Aryan." Kṛṣṇa observed it in Arjuna, and therefore He chastised him, "This kind of proposal is <span class="Italic">anārya-juṣṭam.</span> Under the non-Aryans, you're forgetting your duty." That is the beginning of loss of culture. A small beginning, it creates havoc. Kṛṣṇa warned this, <span class="Italic">anārya-juṣṭam. Kṣatriya's</span> description is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata: yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam,</span> not to go behind. They must fight. That is Aryan culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are doing strategical fight. Strategically great. They should not repeat, but our army is doing strategical fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a Bengali saying-<span class="Italic">palabanata boineki(?):</span> "Am I afraid of you, that I shall not go away?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I must go away. That is my independence!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Kṛṣṇa says specifically, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya, yuddhe cāpy apalāyanam:</span> "You must fight. Face."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That <span class="Italic">yuddhe</span> must be also religious. Not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yuddha...</span> Everything must be religious. Why <span class="Italic">yuddha</span>? Your ordinary living must be also religious. Otherwise animal. Animal also lives. But if you don't live religiously, that is animal. <span class="Italic">Dharmena hena paśave sa.</span> If you live like animal, then you are animal. If you live like human being, that human being means <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> We cannot expect any <span class="Italic">dharma</span> in the animal society. It is meant for the humans. (someone gives Prabhupāda something) Hm, thank you. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says that a flower without smell and a man without education-the same thing. A flower without smell, similarly, a man without education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, what is the distinction between a culture and an education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Culture means human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Human...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human being. Just like Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.</span> This is culture to see every woman as mother. This is not education. Education, the modern meaning of education is rubbish, to learn ABCD. This is not education. Without culture, what is the meaning of education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So culture is the background for all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Education is required to help culture. Not that you take degrees from the university and remain a dog. That is not education. Here is education, as Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says:</div>
<div class="Verse">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat<br class="calibre2"/>ātmāvat sarva-bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ paśyati sa paṇḍitaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Here is a description of <span class="Italic">paṇḍita:</span> first of all learn how to see other woman as your mother. There the culture begins. And they are, from the very beginning of the school college life, they are learning how to entice one girl. This is education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are following the so-called advanced countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Advanced means Freud's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So-called advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sex philosophy. This is their education. So how you can expect gentlemen? It is not possible. From the very beginning there is no culture, animal culture. Just like dogs, as soon as he finds another female dog, he wants to have sex. This is education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One friend of mine he told me that this culture is vultures' culture. They eat anything and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not vultures. It is called hog civilization. The hog, they eat anything and they have sex with anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. These animals they don't distinguish between their own bodily relatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭan kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is instruction. Where is culture? Culture is lost. So therefore there is no value of education. And besides that, education means spiritual education. <span class="Italic">Brahma-vidyā.</span> This education how to make aeroplane or a nice bridge or a machine, this is called <span class="Italic">kalā-vidyā.</span> This is not <span class="Italic">vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Para</span> and <span class="Italic">apara vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">kalā.... Kalā</span> means artistic. Suppose a carpenter, he knows how to make a very nice, good furniture, does it mean that he is educated? He knows the art, some artistic way, that's all; but he is not educated. But nowadays it is going on that if you know some art, technology, then you are educated. This is not education. Education means culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. And culture means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Culture means human life. Otherwise dog's life. There is.... <span class="Italic">Adambhitvam ahiṁsā kṣāntir ārjavam.</span> Everything is described. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam:</span> first of all you have to learn how to become humble. And here all the people, they are educated how to become proud. What is education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Christ says, sir, the meek and humble shall inherit this earth. They unfortunately, the followers of Christ are not meek and humble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this culture cannot be maintained unless one is God conscious. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> There cannot be any culture for a godless person. That is not possible. And, <span class="Italic">yasyāsti-bhaktir bhagavaty-akiñcanā.</span> Just like this European and American boy is offering obeisances to the guru, this is culture. Why he has learned this culture? Because he has become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Therefore <span class="Italic">yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā, sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.</span> If you make one devotee of Kṛṣṇa, then all culture will automatically come. One thing. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So all devotees are cultured?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Theirs is really culture. Prahlāda Mahārāja says, <span class="Italic">tam manye' dhitam uttamam, śravanaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇu-smaraṇam pāda-sevanam arcanam. Tam manye' dhityam uttamam,</span> he is first-class educated. This is recommendation by Prahlāda Mahārāja. And Kṛṣṇa says, "If one is not God-conscious: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtino, mūḍhā, narādhamā, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span>" Where is their qualification? <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina, mūḍha.</span> Where is culture? Suppose you steal by tricks, by, I mean to say, by legal tricks, does it mean it is culture? But that is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means, sir, <span class="Italic">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ, yat kiñcid jagatyāṁ jagat, tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> That should be the background of all the governments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti...</span> (end)</div>
