<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-yoniṣu.</span> All kinds of forms of life, 8,400,000 different forms of life. So "The material nature is the mother and I am the seed-giving father." Why they do not accept this philosophy? And everything is going on. Just like in the family the mother is there and the father is there. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa is the father, and material nature is mother, and we are all sons. If we accept this simple philosophy, everything will be all right. Why they do not accept this philosophy, so many rascal philosophers? This simple philosophy. And this is a fact. What is this body? This body is this earth. "Dust thou art, dust thou beest." So the mother is this material nature. I've got this body. And the father, He is Kṛṣṇa, or God. What is wrong in accepting this philosophy? If this simple philosophy is accepted, the whole world will be happy. But they'll not accept it. These rascals will come, and speculate rascal philosophy. (laughing) With this simple philosophy... United Nations is there. Why do they not accept this simple philosophy? If God is the supreme father and in every religion they accept that, at least the Christian religion accept that supreme father, God, and the material nature is mother. And we are all sons. Not only human beings, every living being, even the dogs. This is philosophy, real philosophy. Is it all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The philosophy now is that God is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha? Father may be dead, but that does not mean the sons are also dead. Father is dead. This father is not dead. That is another rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People might say the philosophy is very good theoretically, but practically speaking, people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not practical? Why not practical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People are very greedy in this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then with these greedy, rascal, rogue, then how you can be happy? Ha? Needs to be punished only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Therefore Marx said that that greed could be got rid of if everybody worked for the state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If everybody pooled their resources.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why state?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, the state is the ultimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take the whole world. You have got the United Nation; why you are busy about the state?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, his idea was that communism should be spread everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is communism. First of all, you accept one father, or the whole world is father's property, and every living being has a right to enjoy the father's property. Why you are thinking this portion is Russia, this portion is American? It is father's property. So if there is rush in China or India, why not allow them to come to Russia or America? "No. That is my property." What is this philosophy? A father's property, everyone has got right to enjoy the father's property. Can this rascal Marx propose communism on this basis? The animals should be slaughtered. Do the father like that if this son is useless, it cannot do any service, so another big son says, "I'll finish him"? The father will like that? So where is that communism? All selfish motive. That's all. Rascal. And devils citing scripture, philosophy. Rascal citing philosophy. He's a rascal. Let him accept that God is... First of all his business is "No God." His only business is "No God." First of all, mother, father is not needed, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like that Comte we were doing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, all rascals are thinking like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They were saying that God's existence is imaginary; man is reality, man is supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because your..., you cannot... Just like our Alfred Ford, he never saw Henry Ford. Then why he says that "I'm the great-grandson of Mr. Ford"? Ford is not there. But why he's claiming Ford's property? Where is Ford? The great-grandson is not expected to see the original establisher of the family. But if there is no philosophy, how they can, any philosophers, all meat-eaters, drunkards, (laughs) woman hunters, and they can be philosophers. (laughs) They're dogs, simply barking. That's all. Simply dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say that our philosophy is nice if we can get everyone to follow it, but we will never...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I follow? Why shall I follow? You are limited. Why should I follow your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say..., they can say all nonsense, but I have to say something. You accept God as the central point, then I accept you. Why you are making state? Then I'll say "I have got my state," then there is fight-American, Russia. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> People read these philosophies and they think that they will get knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Knowledge means misguiding knowledge. That's all. That is not knowledge. That is going on. In the name of knowledge, all rascaldom is going on. That is the misfortune of the present world. In the name of knowledge, all rascal <span class="Italic">isms</span> going. That's all. If we accept after all somebody else is the Supreme Lord, so He's the father. Why don't you accept that? What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The difficulty is that they feel that there's no one that we have to answer to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They feel that there's actually no, there, there's no... First of all, there's no laws, there's no natural laws we have to follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Then why you are dictating laws, philosophy? That is the (indistinct) no laws. Why you are dictating your laws, that we should be communistic, this will be capitalistic, this will be socialistic? Why you are dictating? Let there be no law, as the uncivilized man does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, there should be law, but that law is dictated by man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That law is decided by man in accordance with his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man will dictate law according to his own convenience. Well what about the trees? They are also living entity. You are cutting the trees and making it ugly, because they have no voice to protest. So why man should be given the chance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Most people think that if it's very confusing, and if their philosophy is very contradictory, then it's very profound. They think that if a philosophy is confusing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jugglery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...or contradictory, then it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The word is jugglery. The word is jugglery. If you present something with jugglery of words, "Oh, it is very deep thought." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because they could not understand it, they think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody understands it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Use some big words and don't make any clear points. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (speaking something in a run-on fashion, as a made-up very long word) (everyone laughs) Put some words. (repeats it again) Is there any meaning? (everyone laughs) You have some jugglery of words. (everyone laughs) (repeats in run-on fashion again) What is the meaning of those (repeats phrase)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They will think that "Because I'm not very advanced I cannot understand their philosophy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may think it, but my point is don't be misled by these rascals. (indistinct) Fix up your direction. Don't be misled by these rascals. (indistinct) What you have brought? [break] God is not dead. (indistinct) God is coming to kick you out and kill you. God is not dead. He'll come in due course of time and kill you. God is not dead; he'll be dead. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> He's thinking God is dead... "Yes, yes, I'm coming. Whatever asset you've got, I'll take everything and make it killed. Then you'll understand what is God." These rascals say like that. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham,</span> "I'll take everything. Just wait a few years more. When you'll not be able to say God is dead, you are dead." Rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like Volte. He was eating his own stool and urine before he died, and he was still insisting there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these rascals, they'll be taught a lesson at the time of death. God is not dead; you are dead. You simply wait to see how you are dead. We don't want to discuss all this nonsense philosophy, just to warn them that "You don't be misled by this rascalism." That is my point. Then who kills you? Who has killed your father? Just see. Who has killed your father and who will kill you? Just wait a few years more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They say this is accident. This is philosophy. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That action was created by God. That accident was created by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Also, a cartoon somebody put in the paper and it shows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll accept accident, but not God. Just see his intelligence. He'll accept accident, but not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Most of the philosophers who have this atheistic philosophy, most of them are trained...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are suffering. Why don't you see that? Some of them dying by eating their own stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually, at the end of his life, he (indistinct) some disease, and he went literally crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Disease already there. Old age is already there. That means God is there. They're being punished, but they are so shameless they'll not accept the truth. Same thing. The (indistinct), they're being punished every moment, every step, "No, God is not there." All right. Wait a few years more, God will show either you are dead or He's dead. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I saw this picture once that somebody had drawn. There's a man holding a sign saying "God is dead," and there's a big hand squashing him right on the floor, it's coming from the sky, it's squashing him on the floor, and his sign up on the side saying "God is dead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say that actually there never was any God, it's just a belief that man had.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...revolutionary questions that you're asking because they never stop to ask... They say that you cannot accept any philosophy, why are they giving their philosophy? No one every thought to ask that question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Everyone is rascal. Therefore I say all rascals. They have no sense. If you want me to pose your philosophy, why shall I not impose my philosophy? I've got the same right. Why should I accept yours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Philosophers are saying that there's no philosophy, but they're giving their philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there's no philosophy, why you rascal propose some philosophy? Stop talking. (everyone laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> No philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is better. That is better. There is no struggle. So why you trying to pose your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Philosophers think they know what is best for everyone else, but they don't even know what is best for themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]...presented by Sanātana Gosvāmī before Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Everyone says that I am very learned man, but I am so learned that I do not even know what I am. I'm so learned." (Bengali) This is admission of foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> His first question was, "Tell... Please tell me who I am."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They do not know who he is, and he's philosophize. Calendar..., calendar? Is criticizing ladle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, colander.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Colander.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Full of holes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Hole is used for straining, so many holes....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many holes, and he's criticizing me, "Oh, you have got a hole. (Bengali) These rascal, they do not know whether he's this body or something other than body, and they're philosopher. The basic principle of knowledge is lacking, and they're philosopher. Cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say at the time of death they will learn a lesson, but if, when they go into a new body, they forget, how will it help them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forgetful does not mean that they... Suppose this child, he's hurt, and when he'll be grown up he may forget, but that means... That does not mean that he was not hurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] ...for devotees, then they have no right to claim that they are philosophers or scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇāḥ.</span> If one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious he has no knowledge. He's a rascal, immediately. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the definition given by... If he's not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's immediately miscreant, rascal, and lowest of the mankind. [break] ...may say that he has passed M.A., Ph.D., D.A.C.(?) and he's a philosopher. But we..., our test is whether he's God conscious. If not, he's a rascal. That's all. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No good qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Reject immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that we actually don't believe that they're fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I said our difficulty is that we don't actually believe that they're fools. Most people are thinking that the scientists do have knowledge. We don't fully believe that they are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not believe because you are also fool, rascal. That means you're also rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you be intelligent. You're learning from your spiritual master. <span class="Italic">...gurum eva abhigacchet.</span> Therefore one must approach a guru to learn everything rightly. This is Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Tat tvaṁ puruṣam eva, ācāryopāsanam.</span> Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> This process of knowledge is to worship <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Who's got <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> he knows. <span class="Italic">Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We're accused that when we take to some religious process, that it's a process of brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's not a question of religious process. You must know things are there. Religion is... Religion is that, because religion means to know the real law. That is religion. Not, religion does not mean sentiment. Religion means to know the real law. That is religion. If you do not know the definition of religion, this is it. Religion means to know the real law, how this world is going on, what is the law. That is religion. Religion is not a sentiment. They have made it a kind of faith. You may have some faith, but the law is different. So faith, a dogmatic faith is not religion. To know the real law, this is definition of religion. <span class="Italic">...sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> If you know that law, then everything is revealed to you. That is religion. Religion means not a blind rascal. Religion means he knows everything. That is religion. This is the Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> Just like we are talking with so many philosophers. It does not mean that I'm scientist, philosopher, everything. No. We know one thing, Kṛṣṇa, immediately we can catch up what is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very surprising to people how we have such a wide scope of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately catch up, "Here is a rascal." <span class="Italic">Sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> If you simply know Kṛṣṇa, you know everything. That is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People sometimes can't understand why we are not satisfied that someone has some religious sentiment, even though their knowledge of God may be wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sentiment, there is... In your relationship with your friends and father and mother is sentiment. That is another thing. But you must know "He's my father," "He's my mother," "He's my son." Sentiment is there even in ordinary relationship. You cannot avoid sentiment. Just like we're dancing. That is also sentiment, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." That is sentiment. But that does not mean because he's dancing in sentiment, he does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Sentiment must be there. That is ecstasy, enjoyment. But not blind sentiment. [break] ...you do not know, know from Kṛṣṇa. Anybody can say "I do not know who is my father." And if the real father says, "I'm your father, my son," then how he can prove? How he does not know? If he says, "No, I don't believe you that you are my father," then what is the..., what is evidence? He knows. The mother also says, "Yes, he's your father." " No, I don't believe." What is the evidence? The father is saying, "I'm father." The mother is saying, "Yes, he's your father." But the rascal is saying, "No, I don't believe it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You can't do anything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see his unfortunate position. What he will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will want to know, though, how this will stop two countries from blowing each other up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will want to know how this knowledge that God is the father of everyone will stop these modern-day nations from blowing each other up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do, and suffer(?). (in car) God is the father, and father's property is this whole world. We are all sons, beginning from Brahmā down to the ant, and father's property lets us enjoy equally. That's all. All questions are solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What to do with the greedy people in the world, though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Greedy because you are meant to..., because you don't recognize father and father's property, you have created the situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Because they don't know who the proprietor is, they're thinking "I can take this for myself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore America has so much over-production. Let the hungry men come here. Greediness is not allowed. Whatever... <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> This is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Everything belongs to God. Whatever He allots to you, you take it. In the family the father says, "My dear boy, take of this." That's all. Why should he claim more? The father knows how much he'll eat, and He'll give it. He's supplying the elephant his food, the ant his food. Elephant's not dying starvation. Why you are worried? You want to eat forty kilos. All right. Take it. The father is able to supply. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> He's supplying everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...not a practical solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the knowledge, real knowledge. Eight million, four hundred thousand forms of life, and the supreme father is supplying food to everyone. And each form millions, millions. You'll find millions of one type of fish within the water. And there are nine hundred thousand different forms of fishes. They are eating within this water. Who is supplying them food? We cannot imagine even what is the food there within the water. But there is. Otherwise, how they are living? They have no scarcity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Neither there's any overpopulation either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither. Overpopulation, the fish, they lay eggs hundreds and thousands at a time. You know that? There is not..., unlimited number of eggs they lay down. [break] ...say, "Your food is ready. Just little work." <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just produce food grain. Everyone will be happy. But why they are producing motorcars only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they can go to the market and get the food. So they can drive to the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why market? You can produce your food at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have so much land, and then they grow a crop that they don't need...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have estimated if land lying vacant, if they used for farming, producing food, ten times as many people can be fed. There is no question of scarcity. Your American government, "Oh, don't produce, don't produce, don't produce." If they'll produce more, "I'll throw it in the sea." Produce motorcar. Produce (indistinct), 1967 model. Don't produce foodgrains. This is government's position. Don't produce foodgrains, produce 1967 motorcar, so that there may be more and more accidents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They pay the farmers not to grow crops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (indistinct) There are so many people starving, they have no land to produce food. Therefore the Supreme Father has to be accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like when we were in Fiji, all they grow is sugarcane so they have to sell the sugarcane to get money to buy crops that they could have grown there in the first place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, business. Why so much sugarcane? The islands of Hawaii, they grow more sugarcane. We have seen all the islands. Huge (indistinct). The sugarcane is required for manufacturing wine. [break] ...drink tea. He's much (indistinct) of sugar, and from molasses, they manufacture wine. Unnecessary things. Misadjustment and they're (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even when they try to grow the grains, they can't guarantee it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like in Russia, they projected they would grow so much grains...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature will punish them. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nature is Lord's (indistinct) maintainer, he's observing, factually. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Excuse me. Just like, say, America takes up this idea, that God is the Supreme Father and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say (indistinct) God in trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We trust. Justice. Don't trust blindly. Try to understand what is God. That I am... Later on, I have not received any reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He, American people (indistinct) say, "In God we trust." That's very nice, but why you take this philosophy blindly? Find out who is God and why you should trust. That is intelligence. The slogan is nice, why don't you fight on this issue? The Kṛṣṇa Consciousness movement. You can fight on this issue. Intelligently, if we'll put (indistinct). We trust in God, but what is God? Eh? Hayagrīva? They like to trust in God. Then ask them what is God. They cannot reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> They would say the Christian conception of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any conception, God is not Christian, not Hindu, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> They would say, "God is the Almighty Power."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. (end)</div>
