<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> All the outside influences are also here trying to make propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like here, this is <span class="Italic">māyā</span> influence. These things should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The Chinese come and make propaganda. The Russians come and make propaganda. The Americans come and make propaganda. They become confused what to do.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How this sand is made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> From the rocks it is... They call it weathering. The weather makes it ground up from the rocks. This is their theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Isn't it shells from the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Some. Some from rocks, coral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is made from salt. It is called sodium silicate. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They say this is combination of shells, coral, and rocks, ground up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if it's salt, Prabhupāda, our experience of salt is generally that it dissolves in water, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Silicate there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Salt and silicate.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Hawaii there is no cyclone, I think. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have a volcano on one island. There is one volcano that goes every twelve years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here there is any volcano, on this island?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Nothing left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Only once. Once we had. The island has been created by a volcano itself. And then afterwards, they have no volcano. There are craters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> [break] ...volcano? There was a volcano here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> When? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> A crater, it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We are not so sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Recently it came up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, we are not so sure because before human settlement in Mauritius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> No, but it is... [break] ...please tell us about the creation of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Creation, how... About the creation. I have read it from <span class="Italic">Bible</span> too, about Adam and Eve. Do you think that it's true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the idea of Adam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> God has created him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the same process is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> God created Brahmā, and he created this universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> All which we can see on the earth have been created by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Brahmā. Who is Brahmā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmā is the first creature in the universe, created by God. He came from the navel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Therefore, by himself he could create everything, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Brahmā himself? He is only one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was empowered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> He was only one person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Empowered by God. God created Brahmā, and he was empowered to create the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> There should not have been two people, a female and male?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> There should not have been two people, a male and a female, to create everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, male and female.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Then, apart from Brahmā, there would have been something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Brahmā created male and female.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Oh, he himself created it from...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From his ear, from his eyes, from his..., like that. From many parts of his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Swamijī, there is something quite confusing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa created Lord Viṣṇu, and Lord Viṣṇu in His turn created Lord Brahmā. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not created, expanded. Just like one candle is burning, and you lit up another candle. So this candle is not created, it is simply power transfer. Expansion. You can call it expansion. <span class="Italic">Dīpārcir eva hi daśāntaram abhyupetya</span> [Bs. 5.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> Expansion of the light. This is, contains iodine, this ship. Iodine. That ship is going or coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Going. But he's sitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is standing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's sitting, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy (2):</span> Swamijī, do you think that <span class="Italic">Bible,</span> about the Adam, Adam is Brahmā? It has been copied from the Indian philosophy to put it there in different name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From historical point of view it is copied because <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are created by Brahmā long, long, many millions, millions of years, and <span class="Italic">Bible</span> is created two thousand years. So we have to take the original. All religious system of the world, they are taken from <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> from different parts. Therefore they are not complete. The age of <span class="Italic">Bible</span> is not more than two thousand years. The age of <span class="Italic">Veda</span> you cannot calculate, millions and millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why is it, Prabhupāda, that in earlier parts of the Kali-yuga no one like yourself came throughout the rest of the world and preached Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Preached? Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached. His descendant preached. Why do you say no one preached?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But throughout the rest of the world, places like Japan and Australia...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your calculation of the world. If it is preached anywhere, that is preached on the world. It was not spread, you can say, but it was preached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The seed was planted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They were saving it for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For you also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think they had their hands full with India. They had their hands full with India, all of the preachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What they are collecting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Crabs, I think. Crabs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Swamijī? It is prohibited to consume, consume flesh, meat. It's because there is soul in the body and if we kill it, therefore we are doing a sin. I think it's because that we can't consume meat according to the Vedic literature. But what about plants, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plants also, you... They are also killed. They are also killed. But this is... Plants are killed by the order of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you are not responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Therefore, if we say that we can kill some animal by the order of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then you are not responsible. Suppose I kill one snake by the stick. The stick is not responsible; I am responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> When do you think that you'd know that Kṛṣṇa is responsible and not our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You learn from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> You learn from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> what Kṛṣṇa says and do it. Then you are not responsible for anything. Just like there is lawbook. If you act... (aside:) Don't keep so near. ...act according to lawbook, then you are not criminal. If you violate the lawbook, then you are criminal. Similarly, what Kṛṣṇa says, that is recorded in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> especially in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So you act what is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā;</span> then you remain free from all sinful reaction. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko ya karma-bandhanaḥ. Yajñārthāt</span> means for Kṛṣṇa. Whatever you do, that's all right. Otherwise you are become bound up by the reaction. <span class="Italic">Anyatra karma-bandhanaḥ. Karma-bandhanaḥ</span> means you are bound up by the reaction. So therefore you have to act according to Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. If you act differently, then you are responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> How would you know what to consume and what not, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">. Patram</span> means vegetable, leaves; <span class="Italic">puṣpam,</span> flower. In this way, whatever He says, you collect and offer to Him and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Then you are not responsible. And if you collect for yourself even <span class="Italic">patram</span> without offering to Kṛṣṇa, if you take, you are responsible for killing. It doesn't matter whether you kill a big animal or a small plant. You are responsible. Just like a soldier. He kills hundreds and thousands of men and he is given gold medal. And as soon as he kills one man for his sense gratification he is hanged. Eh? Is it not? He can say, "I have killed so many men. At that time I was not hanged. I was given gold medal. How is that? (laughter) I have killed only one man. I am going to be hanged?" That is law. You cannot do anything on your own account, sense gratification. Then you are responsible. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'ya karma-bandhanaḥ.</span> Everything is stated. Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> very thoroughly and try to understand. Then everything will be clear, how to live, how to organize society. We have to live. The same thing: we are also working, we are also eating, we are sleeping, we are also marrying-but according to Kṛṣṇa's direction. Then it is Kṛṣṇa conscious life and perfect life. And as soon as you do anything whimsically, at your will, then you are responsible. Kṛṣṇa or His representative. Kṛṣṇa is giving instruction, and His representative is explaining. In both ways Kṛṣṇa is helping. So even so much facility being offered to you, if you don't take advantage, then you are committing suicide. <span class="Italic">Ātmahā. Ātmahā.</span> Just like the sea is now calm and quiet. If you want to go somewhere, take advantage of it. And if you start your boat while it is cyclone, then you'll be drowned. So Kṛṣṇa has left the book of instruction, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is favorable condition. And the spiritual master is the captain, and you take advantage. Your, this human body is a good boat. So good boat, favorable condition, good captain-take advantage of crossing this ocean. Otherwise you are committing suicide. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is very difficult to cross over this ocean of nescience, but these are the favorable conditions. One should take advantage of these favorable conditions and cross over this ocean of nescience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Many people, they don't want to accept a captain. They want to go all alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them be drowned. Who can check them? If they do not accept good captain, let them be drowned. There is no regret for them. Let them go to hell. They are going, actually. For their dog's obstinacy they are going to hell. <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viṣatāṁ tamiśram [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is stated. Because they cannot control their senses they are going to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Swamijī, is there any hell, or rather this is hell...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Why not? Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Above the world or in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? You know everything, where, what is where? Do you know? Then why do you ask this question? There is. There is. There is planet, hellish planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> I don't know, I have thought about this, that the hell of the <span class="Italic">pradas(?)</span> exists only in this world itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are the frog of the well. The frog of the well thinks, "This well is everything." And if you say, "There is Atlantic Ocean," he cannot imagine, the frog of the well. You know frog of the well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A three-feet well, and a frog is there and he is thinking, "This is everything." And some friend comes and informs, "Oh, I have seen very big water, Atlantic." He simply imagines, "Oh? It's big? How much big? One feet more? All right, two feet. All right, three feet," like that. So the frogs in the well, they cannot understand. You should be not a frog in the well; you should be liberal to hear from the authorities, <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Then you will understand. And if you remain a frog in the well... All these rascal scientists, they are all frog in the well. They have got little calculation of this planet, and they have no information of... There are so many millions of planets. What do they know? They cannot, could not study even this moon planet. Wrongly study. The moon planet is above the sun planet, 1,000,600,000 miles above. What do they know? They are thinking the moon planet is in between the earth and the... So the all wrong calculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Swamijī, it has been said just as we act... We take birth according to our action. So if we have done something we must take birth according to the law of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must take birth. That is a fact. You cannot avoid it. But according to your <span class="Italic">karma</span> you have to take birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> This means that you pay what you have wrote. Yes, eh? Therefore do you think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose when your, this shirt is torn, you have to purchase one shirt. Now, that shirt you have to purchase according to your price. If you have good price, then you get a good shirt. If you have no money, then you get a bad shirt. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> I wanted to say this, Swamijī, that hell also is situated in this world itself, because where do you think that we can pay our debt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> The sin, the debt of our sin. Where do you think that we pay it? In the hell, which is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hell is the place for your punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Therefore it is on the earth itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> In the planet earth, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> In any planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...many millions miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But it is not locate... Only hell is located in one place or a <span class="Italic">prada(?)</span> is located in another place? Do you think so, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. There are different planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> There are many people who suffer in this world itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are first of all trained up in that hellish planet and then they come here to suffer the same standard of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> When our soul gets out from our body, it goes to the hell or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hellish planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> ...hemisphere or it take birth immediately afterwards?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Those who are sinful, they do not take immediately birth. They first of all trained up in the hellish planet how to suffer to become accustomed and then they are taken birth, then suffer. Just like you pass I.A.S. Then you become an assistant to the magistrate. You learn. Then you are posted as magistrate. Even if you are fit for going back to home, back to Godhead, you are first of all transferred to the universe where Kṛṣṇa is now present, and there you become accustomed. Then you go to real Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Therefore, after our death...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every arrangement by God is perfect. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam. Pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇāt pūrṇam.. [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> Whatever is created by God, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All the associates of Lord Caitanya also were in the same position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Liberated souls. Does Lord Caitanya always appear just after Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In every universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. [break] All questions are answered or not yet? Make it clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Yes. I am thinking about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...the science of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and educate your men on this island and be happy. There is good potency for this island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't be misled by the misleaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> There are many of them here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...here in the understanding and help your people. That is good service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was asked a question by a man. He asked that Lord Śiva... Lord Rāmacandra was praying to Lord Śiva in the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> and so he's taking Lord Śiva as being God. And we didn't have a clear answer to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Could you just instruct us on this matter, why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Rāmacandra worshiped His devotees. Just like sometimes Kṛṣṇa worships Rādhārāṇī and touched His feet..., Her feet. That does not mean that Kṛṣṇa... Just like Kṛṣṇa was tolerating ear pulling by mother Yaśodā. That does not mean that mother Yaśodā is the Supreme. Hm? Kṛṣṇa was carrying the wooden shoes of Nanda Mahārāja. So that does not mean Nanda Mahārāja is greater than Kṛṣṇa. It is Kṛṣṇa's pleasure. Just like sometimes a father takes the son on the shoulder, carries. Does it mean the father is inferior than the son? So this is third-class man's conclusion. They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa, what is Rāma. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So He is the origin of Lord Śiva. So how Śiva can be the Supreme? We have to consult <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Kṛṣṇa does not say that Śiva is Supreme. So if a third-class man says Śiva is Supreme, we have to accept it? We are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, that is Supreme, not a third-class man's version. Is it clear? Yes. We should not take a third-class, fourth-class man's version. We should take from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> Swamijī, Śiva is not another name of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śiva is next to God. Just like yogurt, <span class="Italic">dahi.</span> You know <span class="Italic">dahi?</span> What is this <span class="Italic">dahi?</span> Milk. But it is not milk. <span class="Italic">Dahi</span> is not anything but milk, but it is not milk. Similarly, Lord Śiva is nothing but Viṣṇu, but it is not Viṣṇu. Is it clear now? You can say, "Well, <span class="Italic">dahi</span> is nothing but milk." Yes. But it is not milk. If instead of milk you take <span class="Italic">dahi,</span> the result will be different. And if you take milk instead of <span class="Italic">dahi,</span> that is..., that will be different, although the milk and <span class="Italic">dahi</span> is the same thing, same ingredients. So you have to understand in that way. Lord Śiva is nondifferent from the Supreme Lord. Everyone is nondifferent from Supreme Lord, but he's still different. This is the perfect philosophy, <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> simultaneously one and different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> Swamijī, in all the temples in Mauritius, the supreme deity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supreme Deity is Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> But we consider Lord Śiva to be the supreme deity because we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is your lack of knowledge. I have already explained that, that yogurt is not different from milk. It is milk but still, it is not milk. You have to understand like that. Lord Śiva is not different from Viṣṇu, but he's still not Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> No, but do we offer the prayer first to Śiva...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do. There is no harm. Lord Śiva is also called Mahādeva. Amongst the demigods, he is the chief. So if you worship Lord Śiva... We also worship Śiva. It is not that we disrespect Śiva. We offer our utmost respect to Lord Śiva. But that does not mean that he is the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> The difference that is there, Swamijī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Difference I have already explained. You cannot understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> No, no, we pray Śiva first and then we go to pray Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that you do. There is no harm. There is no harm. But you should understand what is Śiva and what is Viṣṇu. If you offer first prayer to Lord Śiva, there is no harm. It is good. He is... <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ.</span> He is our spiritual master. He is Vaiṣṇava. Why not offer first respect to him? But if you take Lord Śiva as the Supreme, that is insult. You are giving me respect as spiritual master, but if you give me overestimation, that "You are the king of the whole world," that is insult. That is insult. That is not prayer. If you offer me prayer as I am befitting, then it is all right. But if you give me prayer for which I am not befitting, that is insult. That is insult. So you must know what is the position of... Lord Śiva is Vaiṣṇava. He is the greatest devotee. He is the number-one demigod, and everything is all right. But if you say that he is the Supreme, then he will feel insulted, that "What is this nonsense saying?" So don't insult him in that way. That will go against your credit. He doesn't like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Also one other question came up from this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A man may ask so many nonsense. A man is that, imperfect man. Why you bother about that? Man is imperfect. You have to take conclusion from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> A man may say anything nonsense. What we have got to do with him? He is a man, after all, imperfect man. So what is the value of his statement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (7):</span> So he's a man and he's imperfect that he asks questions from you... No, Swamijī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If he submissively asks to know, then we can explain. If he challenges, then he should be avoided. He's a rascal. He does not know what is what.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yesterday at that meeting they were challenging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Some of the men yesterday...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I replied in that way, yes, that "Why you put these ridiculous questions?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes. Before he asked it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's what he could not understand, that you knew he was a... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The other man I said, "Why do you bring India? Never... Kṛṣṇa never said, <span class="Italic">'yadā yadā hi</span> Hindu <span class="Italic">dharmasya glānir...</span>' (laughter) Nonsense, what is this? <span class="Italic">Dharmasya glānir bhavati.</span> Why do you bring 'Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,'</span> India?" That is their imperfectness of knowedge. We are not talking of Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> Muslim <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> this <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> We are talking of what is religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Religion means the law given by God. You should know what is God, what is that law. That is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> They all think we are propagating Hindusim because we're wearing <span class="Italic">dhotī</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are thinking. They are rascals. They are thinking like that. Therefore I say they are imperfect. They are imperfectly thinking. So... So there were many Muslims, and the Christian, that Scotland man, he appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we do not say anything about any particular section. We are speaking about God. God does not belong to any section. When Kṛṣṇa said that there should be four divisions, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> He does not say that these divisions should be in the Hindu society or in India. He never says so. So why they take it as Hindu? Kṛṣṇa does not say that it is meant for the Hindus, for India. If God says that "I have created the sun," does it mean sun is created for India, not for this island? So these are foolishness. Whatever is spoken by God, that is meant for everyone, all over the universe. That is real understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's in the American Constitution that all men are created equally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real idea!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they complain that "If all men are created equally, then each man will have equal opportunity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Equal oppor... We are giving. Any man, he may be <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> but we give them opportunity: "Come on, you become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" We don't deny: "Oh, you are coming from a <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> family. You cannot become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" No. We don't say that. We give equal opportunity. [break] ...is that before this movement, really Vedic culture was never broadcast. Therefore they are finding somewhere contradiction, something astonishing. But Vedic culture is meant for the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has been misrepresented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...the other day, before Mr. Nanda, that how <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> can be from any family. He did not know. No rascal informed him before me. Therefore he was a little surprised. He was also mixed with Anandamaya, this <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that... And nobody informed him. He was kept in darkness. That was the first time that he could understand that <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">-brāhmaṇa</span> can be prepared from anywhere. The whole India is under the impression that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> can be prepared..., <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is manufactured in India and the son of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is propagated by the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> themselves, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, this is the current idea. [break] ...culture is meant for everyone... (end)</div>
