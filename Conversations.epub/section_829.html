<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Purchasing flower means they are being cheated. That's all. All third-grade flowers are supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But this and that plot, these two plots are actually meant by you for growing flowers. I don't know what they're doing. They are growing ornamental plants but not flowering plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> So that piece of land is not exactly on the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> but off the <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> It's not so far from our property. You know the big park near Singhania's place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Then one more park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Park? Singhania's building is there. I have seen. Park, I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> It's an open spot, not exactly park. It's near Fogel Ashram.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. So how did you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Well, the piece of land is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> It has trees on it, some. It's a little bit more than an acre, and the buildings are not very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can be repaired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes. It would be very easy to add on or construct or do whatever you want. And it's, I'd say about five to seven minutes walking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Not far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can have a garage here? So we can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, you can walk on the side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...Prahlāda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yesterday I studied Sixth Chapter of Prahlāda Mahārāja, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Prahlāda Mahārāja's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> From <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata.</span> This morning only I read about this thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...becomes humble. God is for the humble and meek. In Bible also it is stated. And because everyone is trying to become God, how he becomes humble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think Christ taught humility by his own action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Even Vaiṣṇava...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All Vaiṣṇava.... I mean Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> suffered extremely than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kavirāja Gosvāmī, who has written this immortal <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> he is presenting himself, <span class="Italic">purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha: [</span><i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Ādi 5.205] "I am lower than the worms in the stool." Just see. He is not hypocrite. He is feeling like that. "Oh, what is my value?" <span class="Italic">Purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha, jagāi mādhāi haite muñi se pāpiṣṭha.</span> Jagāi-Mādhāi was a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Those two boys Caitanya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he says, "I am more sinful than Jagāi-Mādhāi." <span class="Italic">Mora nāma yei laya tāra puṇya kṣaya:</span> "If anyone remembers me, then whatever pious activities he has done, it is all finished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> don't allow their feet to be touched because they feel that he should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they do not utilize it proper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is a private thing. They want to be (indistinct) My daughter (indistinct) boy who is studying.... He has his M.D. of London (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is settled up. Very nice. And son? Your son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My son is in the Caine(?) Hospital, a professor of medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he is also married? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is married, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Father-mother's responsibility up to marriage. Then they are.... They are locked. They are locked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am more responsible because I have got no wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> [break] ...a lot of money in America. These boys are all from there. They are very good boys. You can get butter from Poland (Holland?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can get everything, but the government will not allow. That is the difficulty. We can get grain, food...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think grain they would allow. So many Christian institutions from America donate butter and <span class="Italic">ghee</span> and rice and wheat to the Christian churches here. I think they would not object. We have not tried, perhaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are trying. In Bengal they are trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not here. They allow. How we are getting that Australian <span class="Italic">ghee</span> all the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They allow from Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They should allow from States also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...milk is cheaper than the bottle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Just as wine is cheaper in Paris than water. I had to pay more for a glass of water. (Hindi) [break] It is not here, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They should come here. So they may arrive some day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is? Arrange to bring him. Otherwise they will not believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, we believe you, sir. But we want a <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So ask. Bring it in the meantime. [break] ...not less than one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of devotees, at least, so crowded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is that at, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is on holy day, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And one on the day you were in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There also, packed up, so many. Now our temple is going first, even the other temples are so old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was so crowded that you could not even walk on the road coming into our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it was a barren place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They all come to see the devotees. These foreign devotees, they are enchanted to see them. All these times we were seeing the foreign, foreign, those padres, the Christians. Now we are seeing the <span class="Italic">sanātana...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another the thing is that Ramakrishna Mission has constructed temple of Ramakrishna. Nobody goes there. It is lying barren.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You were planning to raise a temple in Kurukṣetra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have applied to the government for land, twenty-five acres land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very big. But is that land available to us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, available. And we have asked government to give us 350 acres of land in Māyāpura to construct Vedic planetarium, 350 feet high. It will require eight <span class="Italic">crores</span> of rupees minimum. I shall exhibit there all the planetary system, <span class="Italic">bhurloka, Goloka...</span></div>
<div class="Verse">goloka-nāmni nija-dhāmni tale ca tasya<br class="calibre2"/>devī-maheśa-hari-dhāmasu teṣu teṣu<br class="calibre2"/>te te prabhāva-nicayā vihitāś ca yena<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.43]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now the Russians also have come to this conclusion, the Russian scientists and astro-physicists, that there are some planets here in the cosmos which actually have people, I mean, has life like human beings. The other day I read a big article on that. Now they agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will agree so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They will agree later on that the dialectical materialism is not the right thing, but the dialectical spiritualism is the right thing. What Karl Marx said was wrong. But they have started reading the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and all these, <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata,</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got good sympathy for Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And if they read it, then Karl Marx teaching will go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are getting enquiries from Russia of our books, about our books. We are getting enquiries. I am sending Gopāla Kṛṣṇa to make market of our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> They have some of our books already in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If they start reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then Karl Marx will be lost because the <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is a spiritual communism in fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> The only difference is that the guru never ends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> The guru never goes out of office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sanātana</span> is eternal. It is eternal religion. It is the religion of the soul and not of the body, dies. Soul is eternal, so religion is eternal. I am right, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sanātana</span> means eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So this dialectical materialism wherein Karl Marx said that it is a material reaction, chemical reaction in the material, which produces consciousness, it is a falsehood. It is the consciousness keeps the material going. So they will change their opinion now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> He's basing philosophy on Hegel, thesis and antithesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, No, Hegel.... Yes, Engels, not Hegel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Thesis and antithesis, and then synthesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> But it's a false philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean Hegel did try to improve upon Karl Marx. Really material is important. When the person dies why the body should rot? They every day see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Prabhupāda pointed out the other day that when someone dies, we have all the bodily fluids there, all the organs. Why can't we put it together and make life again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. So now they have started reading all these, our books. They will now make amendment on it. As you said, they will thesis, synthesis. The present practice of communism in Russia is much more diluted than what it was twenty, thirty years back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And it will be like India after twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> The result is that the biggest problem in Russia is that no one comes to work-absenteeism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That will be here also. I have been to Ceylon, sir. And in Colombo they are giving free ration to the people. I mean, the rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a story in Bengal. (Bengali) The woman had seven sons. The mother requested first son, "My dear boy, now I am going to die. Take me to the Ganges side." He said, "Why? You have got so many other sons, why you are requesting me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She was calling every one, and nobody took her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then second son, third.... Everyone said like that, and she died without Gaṅgā. <span class="Italic">Agar mā gaṅgā.(?)</span> So this.... And everyone has to work. And he thinks that "Why I shall work? Let him work. No work today."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> You tell the story about a man beating with a stick, and then the police constable came and said, "You have beaten him." "No, no, no. It was the stick that beat him, not me." (laughter) No responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but, you see, the sense of possession in human society is more important, because they have no sense of possession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even with all our philosophic and all our learning we have the sense of possession of this body which can't leave the <span class="Italic">moha</span> in it. With all that, sir, then how can they do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, higher than that, the sense that everything is possessed by God, that is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are making.... Just like I possess something, now their possession is.... Now you possess something. We are not reaching the point of God. So it is expanded selfishness. It is not perfect. Perfection will come when they understand that everything is possessed by God. Then that is.... <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> When they come to that conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have started doing. Even grammar is good. They have started studying <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> in earnest now. I read an article on that, Russian newspapers, studying the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They said <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> by Tulasī dāsa, translated in English, and it was finished within a week. They have got little sympathy for Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This idea that he was discussing, how we naturally have a tendency to possess something.... If I don't possess the state, I possess the body. Is this the disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have to nullify this, that "I don't possess anything; God possess everything." Then it is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that is why, sir, this communism cannot survive, because they say that afterward the state will vanish. It will evaporate. How can it evaporate without spiritualism there at the back? They have a materialistic ideology and material, I mean, there are changes. There is nothing permanent in material. So the communism, so-called material communism, dialectic materialism of Karl Marx, are not full. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Your name is man, and Dr. Patel.... You've been given a title, "Dr. Patel."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda gave an example that if you see a note on the floor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only name of God has value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda gave the example that if you see a note on the floor, three different people, one person sees it and ignores it, so he doesn't know the proper utilization of the thing. Another person sees it, picks it up and puts it in his pocket. He is dishonest. The third person sees it, picks it up, and seeks out the real owner. So there has to be Kṛṣṇa consciousness; otherwise how do we know who everything belongs to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is spiritual concern. And spirit itself.... Kṛṣṇa is.... I mean, without Kṛṣṇa there cannot be anything. That is the highest culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Kṛṣṇa even lets people forget Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (plane overhead) <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...and <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> shall be ready. Anyone comes, he may give him. Then it will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But God has made <span class="Italic">māyā</span> so strong that if the man is not attracted or caught into the web of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the whole <span class="Italic">saṁsāra</span> would not go. (laughs) That because God wants to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same argument. If people do not become criminal, how the prison house will be maintained?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is a prison house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> God wants the prison house to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> No, no, first there are so many criminals, and then prison house has to be built. Because there are so many, a bigger prison house has to be built.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like now medical science is improving means hospital increasing. That means people are becoming more diseased. And they are taking it advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, modern advancement is required, even hospitals. So modern medicine is always preventative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop disease; otherwise where is improvement? (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...poetry, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare, nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as the living entity desires sense gratification, immediately <span class="Italic">māyā</span> captures.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> New (indistinct), do you mean to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, old (indistinct), everything. Yes, all, all squared up, all accounts squared up. Begin new chapter of your life. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as one begins devotional service, he shall be clean of all sinful reactions. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So why not stay for a longer time here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody comes to hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When you are staying here in Bombay your health does improve very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Bombay I like very well. Because I like Bombay and this beach, I was so much persistent for get this land. That is the history. Every one of my disciples, they declined. I insisted, "I must possess this land." And Nair was thinking that "This man has no money, so just involve him, and whatever money he gives us, I take it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But before he could sell, he died, poor fellow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He died, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] And when she decided to kill Kṛṣṇa, she was killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And Kṛṣṇa gave...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she got good fortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gave her the <span class="Italic">mukti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kambhat? Kambhata? Kambhata</span> means this...(?)</div>
