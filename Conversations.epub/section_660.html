<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This side is going to be constructed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> This side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We have to get the plan sanctioned first of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not sanctioned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, you mean one more story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh. Well, we were considering demolishing this one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demolishing.... Saurabha said that cannot be... Here we cannot build?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, we have to have a certain amount of garden space, and according to the master plan this is supposed to be garden. Otherwise we're not allowed to build any other building there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Then, above that, that side we shall build.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Very big building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That, big... Here you can simply have one story more. And what about this land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This is used now for storing sand. That land or this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This will be garden also, but now we keep for storing because we need that for sand here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we have to add a second floor there we can make it a BBT warehouse, exactly as per your directions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why not others? BBT warehouse, there are so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, a big room will be very good, so when we construct that, we can have a big hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. A big hall, like in Los Angeles where we can have shelves and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The slab is not strong enough to have so much weight on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It has to be on the ground floor. We were thinking of making a godown there in the back, in back of the temple. When we build the temple, we build also a godown there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Mr. Menon is willing to move upstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Mr. Menon, who has a flat on the ground floor, he is willing to shift upstairs if we want to trade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let's have a look at his apartment today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you can make down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That can be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually down will be better for warehouse because then you don't have to carry the books two flights down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When a shipment comes it is easier to put it inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Let us first of all construct. Then we can consider. The dogs cannot enter anymore. Now they enter. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] No. I'm not feeling very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then I think something should be done for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So how many stories this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Ground floor, eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? How many we are having?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> We have... Well, the height would come same as that. This is the limit now. They don't allow any higher building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We could have had an extra story, but since the ground floor will be round and public gathering place, so we're making a little higher plinth in a higher ceiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. Do it nicely. And we cannot make garage like that? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, we can make. How many garages do you want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The difficulty is there's a law that so much garden we have to make, and each garden has to be minimum 4,000 square feet, so it has to be one particular area. And our land has been divided in so many small pieces, so we have somewhere to make a big garden. Then everywhere else we can build.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do. You have got enough space. (end)</div>
