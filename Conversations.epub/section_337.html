<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 19, 1973, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā</span> is now old. We require new knowledge." What is your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That Kṛṣṇa is eternal and perfect, and whatever Kṛṣṇa speaks is also eternally perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">Śāśvata</span> means eternally fresh. Therefore ignorance is also eternal. Because knowledge means absence of ignorance. That is knowledge. So side by side, two things are there. Now, if you are in ignorance, there is no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nābhāvo vidyate sataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Nāsato vidyate bhāvaḥ.</span> It is the negative. Positive side is knowledge. Darkness. Darkness. Just like, where there is no light, there is darkness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...Prabhupāda, we'll be able to see that comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They say one hour before dawn in the eastern horizon. [break] ...talking a lot about in trusting in God. What is the Sanskrit for trust? What word would be used in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śraddhā,</span> faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> And there are particular scriptural verses that speak about this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> That is the beginning of spiritual consciousness, faith.</div>
<div class="Verse">śraddhā-śabde-viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya </span> 22.62]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the version of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Śraddhā</span> means firm faith. <span class="Italic">Śraddhā-śabde viśvāsa kahe sudṛḍha niścaya.</span> Firm faith. And firm faith is trust. "I trust you," means I have got firm faith in you. Is it not? So trust means firm faith. Firm faith means... Now that "So long God is my order supplier, I trust in Him, and as soon as He refuses to supply my order, I don't trust Him," that is not firm faith. "God is putting me in distress; still, I trust Him. Or God is putting me in happiness; still, I trust Him." That is called firm faith. In any circumstances, the faith is not withdrawn. That is firm faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Unconditionally then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unconditionally means, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> giving up all other conditions of faith. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We only hear about him eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you did not refute that idea? We see every moment God. What is that light? Even if you see light, what do you gain by that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He says that Guru Maharaji is the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Here is electric light also. So what is the benefit? Light, you have got so many lights. So what is the benefit? If you remain in the darkness, then what is the benefit of this light? Light means you are not in darkness. But you are in darkness. If you have got the light, then you can see Kṛṣṇa. But why do you say that by Kṛṣṇa consciousness we cannot see Kṛṣṇa. Rascal. We may not see. But you have seen the light, why don't you see Kṛṣṇa? Do you know what is Kṛṣṇa if you have seen Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It's true, Prabhupāda. They are in darkness because they cannot check their material activities by seeing the light. They go on with sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Light. We have go so many lights. What is the benefit of seeing the light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They only call us so that we'll arrange to bring some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not supply <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> these rascals? [break] Everyone can see. So if Guru Maharaji is light, then why everybody does not follow? If he is light, light can be seen by everyone. Just like sunlight, moonlight, we can see. Everyone can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They argue that he only will reveal himself to those who surrender to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But those who have surrendered, they cannot speak anything. They are in darkness. When we talk with your disciple who has surrendered, they cannot argue with us. They are in darkness. So what kind of light he has seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It is all just sentimental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Many of these bogus groups, Prabhupāda, they claim that God is simply sound and light. So their meditation means seeing what they call <span class="Italic">ājñā-cakra,</span> or point between eyebrows. They see there and they hear sounds, bells and thunder and flute all within. And that is their meditation. Hearing these sounds and see these lights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but what do you gain by that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Supposedly they go to higher levels of existence, higher levels of consciousness. They change the sound and the colors change...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot give up even smoking. You are in higher level of consciousness? So what is the proof that you are on the higher level of the consciousness? You cannot give up even ordinary things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They say that the scriptures aren't relevant in this age, that they don't make any difference in this age. They were for previous ages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Because people cannot understand them, so Guru Maharaji has simply come and making it very simple. He just makes them see the light and then everything is simple. They don't have to do anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is the benefit of seeing that light? He has to work, he has to search out for food. So what is the benefit by seeing the light? By seeing the light, has he become freed from all this botheration? Then what is the use of that light he has seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nivartate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They say the benefit of the light is that light is God. So when they see that light, that is God. So that is the benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When you see light, you must know there is a source of light. Just like you are seeing the light and the light is there. Therefore there must be a source of the light. Unless you see Him, it is not perfect. Besides that, whether you have seen actually the light? What is the result of seeing that light? Do they explain? Suppose he has seen. I have not seen. So what is the difference between him and me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Unless the heart becomes purified, there is no sense in seeing any light. The heart has to become cleansed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say they will be happier than someone who has not seen the light. Their life will have more meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So happier, they are becoming happier in so many other ways. What is the use of seeing the light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The pigs are also happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Don't waste time by arguing with him. Neglect them. Do not talk of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Just like you say, Prabhupāda, they are actually defeating themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The scientists are much more formidable demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not formidable. They can easily conquered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I have heard that Amarendra is defeating them in Gainesville. He goes to scientific meetings and he defeats them. And the devotees go in the audience, and they cheer, and he defeats them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Is it sometimes cold in the spiritual world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (laughter) You don't like to go there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Oh yes, I like to go there. Actually, I would rather be here in the cold with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, than be in the warm without you.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We get the information from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is said, <span class="Italic">na tad bhāsayate sūryaḥ.</span> There is no need of sunshine. So how it can be cold? Sunshine is required where it is cold, but there is no need of sunshine. Naturally, the conclusion should be it is neither cold neither hot. It is enjoyable. Cold, heat, all troubles, they are in the material world. The spiritual world is simply blissful life, enjoying. [break] As soon as the light is there, the darkness is gone. So why in the night there is darkness if he is light? Why in the night meeting these rascals require other light, electric light, if he is light? What kind of light he is? If he is light, at least they could save the expenditure of electric lights. But why does he use electric light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> He says he only sees light when he closes his eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Close?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, close or open...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Inner light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Inner light, not outward light. Then he is not absolute. He is relative. He is relative. He is not absolute. So God is absolute. But you are relative. Therefore you are not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Kṛṣṇa illuminated the house of the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa, he does not accept Kṛṣṇa. That is rejected. Now we are talking about him. If he is light, why does he use electric light? If he says, "The inner light," then you are relative. You see only inner side, not outside. Therefore you are relative. Therefore you are not God. God is absolute. <span class="Italic">Antar-bahiḥ.</span> One has to see light inside and outside. That is real light. If the light is checked by some material condition, that is not absolute light. That is electric light. As soon as you come to the condition, then it is relative. It is not absolute. [break] A man can be changed from barking to chanting, but dog cannot be. [break] ...is so powerful that as soon as there is sunrise, immediately darkness gone. Similarly, if the absolute light is there, if there is need of electricity, what kind of light it is? Even the relative light is so powerful that immediately darkness gone. So you are not as powerful as the relative light. So what kind of light you are? This should be the argument. You are cheating. You are not light. You are darkness. Our, that slogan is "Where there is God, there is no darkness." "Kṛṣṇa is like the sun, and nescience is like darkness. Where there is Kṛṣṇa, there is no darkness." Don't waste time with these rascals. Go on with your own business. You sold <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (laughs) That is our profit. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Over a thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. In that meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they could not sell their magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) So just imagine where is light. In our side or their side? They are deprecating, <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā</span> is now old. We require new knowledge." Still, we sold thousand copies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Finally the Guru Maharaji said over the microphone, "Don't buy more of these <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās.</span>" (laughter) He said it's not bona fide. I told Prabhupāda that when the devotees had a big <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> all the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what was the result, stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yeah, after that it was more difficult. After that, the devotees were preaching more to individuals. But that was already after a thousand <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> had been sold. Everyone left their meeting and went out to see the <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> They had to keep calling them back, over and over again, "Please, please come back." (end)</div>
