<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that the trees and plants, they have got life? Do they accept or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They say they've recorded different types of living symptoms in plants and what have you. They see how plants react to different stimulus. And there's experiments that they actually react out of fear. They show symptoms of fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, they have soul or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they say that the human beings haven't got a soul, so what to speak of animals and plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they mean by soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) They don't mean anything. They think it's all just chemical reaction. But nowadays they're doing more research into things like telepathy and what they call ESP, extra-sensory perception. Rather than just put it down to basic chemical reactions, they're thinking that there's something on a more subtle platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's what they call ESP, extra-sensory perception, something that you can't see but it's still there, the influence of the mind over material objects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say that material objects are just like automobiles, dead, but they can't move without the influence of the spirit soul. So the human being or the trees and the <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> were seeing that the body is moving, so many things are taking place. The point is that in the universe, wind is blowing, the ocean is moving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is (inaudible). You are in small soul, and there is big soul, Supersoul. Similarly, as the soul is (inaudible). There must be soul. Similarly, this material combination (inaudible). Without Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, there is no actual (inaudible).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu is the Supersoul of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is an ocean (inaudible) each planet, and in the Causal Ocean is Garbhodakaśāyī. [break] ...ocean, many planets and (inaudible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Where? Underneath the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You said that the different living entities in lower forms of life, they became those lower forms of life due to their work in the human form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. A criminal is freed, but if he again commits criminal..., criminality, then again he's put into the jail, like that. (inaudible) ...his freedom, now make your choice. But if you misuse it, then again go.... <span class="Italic">māyāprāpte nivartante mṛtyuḥ saṁsāra vartmani.</span> [break] ...go home back to Godhead. But if we do not take the chance, and misuse it, like animals, then again we go down. The process is to go back to home, back to Godhead, eternal life, blissful life. And other process is the cycle of birth and death in different species of life. So this human form of body is to make choice whether to continue the cycle of birth and death in different species of life, or you want to go home, back to Godhead. (Sanskrit) He's Kṛṣṇa conscious when he goes back to home, back to Godhead. (inaudible) species of life, according to <span class="Italic">karma,</span> they're going to be fish. From fish, by nature's way, leads to the plants, then insect. In this way.... Then birds, then beasts, again human being. Again another birth. In this way they are.... <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Similarly, after many, many births, when he comes to his senses.... "I have enjoyed very nice life. Now let me go back home..." <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti... [Bg. </span>7.19]. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> Such <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> great soul, who has accepted that Kṛṣṇa is everything, he is very, very rarely found. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu [Bg. 7.3].</span> After many, many millions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When one takes to spiritual life, is it the result of material exhaustion, or is it simply the guru's mercy on him, and nothing else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two ways. One is called <span class="Italic">sādhana-siddhi.</span> One is called <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddhi.</span> What is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If when one comes to spiritual life, is he coming because of material exhaustion, so much pain in the material world, so therefore he's searching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When one is actually in service, then he comes to.... "So I have enjoyed. Now, no I don't want. Now I want Kṛṣṇa." That is voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But is it the guru? Does the guru give him that sense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Guru is traveling all over the world, "Take this science." If one is fortunate he can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Those persons who are atheistic, they say that God is created out of a necessity, that people have a necessity to have their father image, so therefore they create religion. This is their basic philosophy, that man creates his own religion. He creates it out of necessity. He needs a father image, so therefore he creates the idea of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Created? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> No. They feel that we have created, man has created the idea of God out of necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> The atheists are saying that man needs God although there is no God. They are insecure in this world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They feel basically that it's an idea. God is an idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is idea? Explain. What for this idea? Why this idea is necessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Basically I think because in the Western countries there's no conception of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They.... Those who have no conception, that is another thing. But those who talk of God, that there is God or there is no God, what is the conception of God? That is.... Why do they say there is no God? Why do they say there is God? Somebody accept there is God. Somebody does not accept. So, there are two causes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The basic principle is that God is there, so you either accept or reject Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs) One is doubtful or one is convinced. God is there. One is doubtful, he says "There is no God." My question is why the question of God is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> General consensus is that when one is in need of God, then they accept God. They don't think that out of knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am asking what is the conception, why they need, why they do not need. First of all describe food. There is some idea, that food is like this. Then the question of food. If there is no need of food, then why is this food question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like the child wants to be protected by the parent, they're thinking that..., therefore people are feeling that they want to be protected by God. The child is always seeking protection from the parent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is necessity of God. Just like the child, there is necessity of the parents, a parent is there. Similarly, you feel necessity of God, God is there. Feeling the necessity of parent, the parents are there. Similarly, if you feel necessity of God, then God is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say that because people are feeling this necessity, it is a crutch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Necessity means there is. Otherwise why necessity? When you feel hungry, the necessity of food, food is there. The necessity of light, the sun is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Do you mean, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in order to conceive of something, a thing must be there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "conceive." Necessity. You require it. Just like when you're hungry you require food. Food is there. The eyes want to see; therefore the object of seeing is there. The hand wants to touch, so the object of touching is there. The nose wants to smell: the object of smell is there. So as soon as you feel necessity, the thing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And it's there even if you don't feel the necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's there even if you don't feel the necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another tradition. First of all, as soon as you feel necessity, the object is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> They say that necessity should not be God, but that it should be transferred to man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not talking of God. I say as soon as you feel necessity, the object is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> That necessity is our mistake. That is our insecurity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So.... [break] ...that is mistake, then you are rascal, that's all. Mistake is committed by rascal. So you are rascal. If you commit mistake then you are rascal. Then don't talk, stop talking. (everyone laughs) Who is going to hear a rascal? (indistinct) [break] ...he is hungry, there is no necessity of food? Who's that rascal that says "No, there is no necessity of food"? He's feeling hungry, he wants to eat something, and if he says "No, there is no necessity of food," then is he not rascal? And if you say "Now we are feeling the necessity of food, but that is my mistake," is that answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They're feeling that some people have the necessity for God, but actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That is the question. Why some people have? That means some people intelligent, some people rascals. That's all. This is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The question is, why some people are feeling a necessity for God? That is the question they ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference between rascal and intelligent. Just like in Hawaii Island, when the rascals were living, they did not feel the necessity of skyscraper. When intelligent Americans came, they feel the necessity. That is the difference. (everyone laughs) Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Necessity is the mother of invention. That is an English proverb. Is it not? So unless you feel necessity, you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, taking that the other way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dull matter. Dull matter. It has no necessity. It is dull matter. And as soon as you have got life, there is necessity. Without feeling necessity means dullness. Just like these Hawaiians, very nice. They did not think the necessity of the skyscraper, motorcar.... But when it was inhabited by the Americans, (indistinct) That is the difference between advanced and not advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Can one say that necessity for eating, sleeping, mating and defending is animal life? The necessity for God is advanced life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Necessity means more you become advanced, the more necessity. Necessity mother of invention. Advancement, they are manufacturing so many things. There is no necessity of car, but people are advanced, they are inventing: "Now comfortably I shall..." So necessity means advanced life. No necessity means dull life. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The atheists fear that they've put the necessity on the wrong object.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they're rascals. If there is no necessity, that means dull life, dull brain. The madman will think there is no necessity of clothing: "I can remain naked." And actually remains. He's a madman. And a sensible man, he requires dress, nice dress, first-class dress. So this is the difference between intelligent and dull. Dull has no necessity. Intelligent has necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> He has necessity for God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu [Bg. 7.3].</span> Out of millions and millions people one has the necessity for Kṛṣṇa. [break] Material scientists, they are creating necessities, television, and they are thinking advanced. What is the use of television? There is no use. But this is advanced civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In relative terms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless there is necessity, what is the advancement? There is dull matter. <span class="Italic">Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat</span> [Bg. 7.5]<span class="Italic">. Apareyam.</span> The dull matter is inferior energy. And the <span class="Italic">anya-prakṛti, apareyam itas tu viddhi me prakṛtiṁ parām, jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho,</span> the living entities, they have got necessities. Dull matter, there are no necessities. The more one is dull, his necessities are less. And those who are advanced, his necessities begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they use.... They argue that, say like in India, where there's no great material development...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we shall judge the quality of necessity. That is another thing. First of all necessities, then quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all we have to understand that one who has no necessity, he's in the lowest status. One who has got necessity, he is in higher status.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then higher, higher, higher, higher-where's the higher status? When you necessitate Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> That necessity, that without Govinda I'm feeling everything vacant. That is necessity. That makes it finer (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Is this the <span class="Italic">anna-maya, prāṇa-maya, mano-maya,</span> like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many stages. Here is the highest status. <span class="Italic">Govinda-viraheṇa me. Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa.</span> "For want of Govinda, I am thinking one moment as twelve years." <span class="Italic">Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣāyitam.</span> "I'm crying like torrents of rain from my eyes." This is the highest necessity. This is also necessity. <span class="Italic">Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛ.... Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvam.</span> "I don't see anything. Everything is vacant." And that we have experience. If somebody whom you love very much, he dies, you think, "I don't want anything. World is vacant." I've no necessity but Kṛṣṇa. This is also necessity. So we have to see first of all necessity, then quality of necessity. This is .... There is no necessity means dull matter. Similarly, when there is no necessity of God, one is in the lowest stage of life, <span class="Italic">narādhama,</span> animal, less than animal, <span class="Italic">narādhama,</span> at least, lowest of mankind. If he does not feel the necessity of God, that means lowest of mankind. Necessity of Caitanya Mahāprabhu also.... <span class="Italic">Yugāyitaṁ nimeṣeṇa cakṣuṣā prāvṛṣay...</span> A Vaiṣṇava says that "I have no more necessity." But he has no more necessity of this false necessities, material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Anarthas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Anarthas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anartha.</span> [break] ...they stop here. No more this material necessities. But he does not know that he cannot live without necessities. That they do not know. They simply beget these false necessities. Just like disease. I do not want disease, but that does not mean I do not want health. (everyone laughs) So these rascals, they are thinking that "We do not want anymore this material world, <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagat...</span>" But Vaiṣṇava says "No, you must have the real thing, then you can cease from this unreal necessities. Otherwise after living for some time in <span class="Italic">brahma satya,</span> then you'll come, "Oh, this is useless. I don't enjoy. Let me go again to open hospital, school, engage in something politics, no work..." But you cannot do. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛccheṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ.</span> We are living entities. We require engagement, necessities. So give up necessities means these rascal necessities. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He's <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> He has no necessity. Why He's crying for Govinda? He has given up the whole world, <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> And why He's crying for Govinda? That is real necessity. <span class="Italic">Govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> Govinda necessity. The necessity is Govinda is not alone. There again life, again Vṛndāvana, again <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> again dancing, again eating, again everything. That necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> As a necessity, this is a symptom of weakness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, this weakness..., you are already necessity of so many things. Make all the necessities zero. At last we at least feel necessity of a woman. (laughing) That you cannot avoid. And then you'll be punished with shoes. (laughing) When you'll become a servant of woman, then you, "No, what is the necessity?" Become thief, you'll become rascal, rogue, you'll be beaten by shoes, and everything is gone. Now these are your necessities. Hippies, they have left no necessities, but the woman is there. (laughing) They have necessities there. Nature is so powerful you'll have to feel this necessity, and with this necessity you'll require so many necessities. (Sanskrit) They're talking like madmen. What the madman does not talk, and what the goat does not eat? (laughing) Means rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It boils down to this question of independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They all want to be independent, but there's no chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> [break] ...in the kingdom of God, then he can become independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The idea of God is not for everyone. Only for the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> at death, <span class="Italic">brahma-jānāti vibrāhmaṇa.</span> Our process is to give them chance to hear. Then they'll get gradually idea, not immediate. In the beginning let him eat <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. [break] "My dear friend, please come. Chant with us, dance with us, and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" There will be no.... (end)</div>
