<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 9, 1974, Los Angeles</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now if they say that the killing means murdering, that means the people amongst whom Christ was preaching, they were accustomed to kill men. So what class of men they were? What was the society? A society of murderers. So what they will understand about religion, a murderer? (pause) So go further or return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We should probably turn around now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (pause) If you're preaching honesty to a thief, you have to be careful that he's not stealing your watch in the meantime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> If you're preaching honesty to a thief, he may steal your watch. So Jesus was trying to teach religion to murderers, so they murdered him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye.</span> (aside:) Don't come very near. If you advise rascals, they'll be angry. No good result. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye, payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.</span> So we have to become very strong preacher. Then this movement will stay. If you simply take the temple worship, it will not stay very long. Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Especially the leaders must preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Especially the leaders must preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And leaders means... If the leaders are good, then it will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> If they are not preaching, they are not leaders. They are bogus. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Leaders means they should behave in such a way so that by following them, others will be benefitted. That is leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's a perfect definition, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's a perfect definition. That should be in the dictionary, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is that for definition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The... A leader means one that if someone follows him, he's benefitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Look out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Look out. Oh, the ocean is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Juhu Beach is better than... Best in the world. You have not seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I was there. Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukrpa:</span> What do you think of Jagannātha Purī Beach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Not so nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Juhu Beach is very nice. You can go up to one mile, so much water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> Up to the knee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> Just up to the knee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the waves are not so ferocious. It is coming. And the whole thing is clean, whole beach. Yes. And it is ten miles long. Therefore so many foreigners' hotels are there. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) (pause) When I was last here, Los Angeles, which chapter I was reading? Who knows? Which chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> I was reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Fifth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The last time he was here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In Los Angeles you were reading in the Third Volume of the First Canto. I believe it was about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> About Arjuna, how Arjuna left the earth, how the Pāṇḍavas retired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Ah, Pāṇḍavas Retire, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So from there we shall begin again. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) (long pause) If the people refuse to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll never be happy. This is a fact. (pause) But if you present properly, they will take. That is a fact. The other day in San Francisco, there were about twelve to fifteen thousand men. They were hearing so patiently. They also applauded. And many came to my car, "Thank you, Prabhupāda. Thank you, Prabhupāda. Thank you, Prabhupāda." Said like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I've never seen so many young Americans sit for, listen to the lecture so attentively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And religious, most dry subject. Not cinema.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The newspaper said that it was the most favorite festival of all San Francisco, of all the festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have mentioned, "American Hindus." (chuckles) (pause) It is a dead blow to the material civilization: "No drinking and no intoxication, no meat-eating, no gambling, no illicit sex." Their whole civilization is finished. Because they stand on these things, four pillars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> Therefore we must present a better civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> We must present a better civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not better or best. <span class="Italic">The</span> civilization. Everything is all false, cheating. Everything, everything is cheating. Without this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all other consciousness, they're simply cheating. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> illusion. If you remain in any other consciousness except Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that means you are in illusion. You are misguided. That is explained in the second verse of the First Canto. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vāstava vastu vedyam atra: [SB </span>1.1.2] All kinds of cheating religious system is kicked out." That is the second verse. <span class="Italic">Projjhita,</span> completely cleansed of all cheating type of religion. This, this has been translated into Bengali by these words,</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte yāha kichu dharma nāme cale<br class="calibre2"/>bhāgavata kāhe taha paripūrṇa chale</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Whatever is going on throughout the whole world in the name of religion, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> according to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> they're all cheating. They're all cheating. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata kāhe taha paripūrṇa chale. Chale</span> means cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What exactly is the definition of a cheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What is the definition of a cheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheat means that I am exploiting you. I am saying that I am creating you a religious, but you are most sinful. I am creating a most sinful. That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> Giving something under false pretensions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. You are taking something else while thinking something else. That is cheating. Actually, we see the so-called religious system... Religion means to become lover of God. But who is lover of God? Do not know what is God, and what to speak of love Him. They do not know, have no clear conception of God even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They are lovers of dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And actually they are lovers of dog. And still, he's professing "I am religious." This is not cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, it's cheating. Imposter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless one becomes a devotee of God, there is no question of religion. It is all cheating. By opening hospital, schools,... There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands upon thousands of years, the hospitals and schools are being opened, philanthropy. What is the result?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Atom bombs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atom bomb. Result is atom bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You're the only one, Prabhupāda, who dares to criticize hospitals and schools. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many people came to request me... Even Dr. Ghosh. Eh? You know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He wanted you to open a medical dispensary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No, no, we are not going to waste our time in that way." I frankly told him. We have no extra time to waste like that. What he thinks very big project, we say it is waste of time. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> It is a completely revolutionary idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I cannot allow anyone he's waste his valuable time of human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> You said before that the more hospitals they open that means the more people have to become sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, more... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpa:</span> To get in the hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very much proud, "We have opened fifty hospitals." That means fifty thousand people have become sick. "We have increased so many beds." That means so many people have more increased their disease. But they're proud of doing this. Our poor-feeding and their poor-feeding is different. We give <span class="Italic">prasādam-</span>by eating he'll become Kṛṣṇaized. He'll become a devotee. And ordinary eating means he will eat and go to hell. Hare Kṛṣṇa (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇotkīrtana-gāna-nartana-parau...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> <span class="Italic">Jāyate.</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
