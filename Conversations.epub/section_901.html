<div class="Heading">Conversation in Airport and Car<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 21, 1976, Toronto</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...Chapter,</div>
<div class="Verse">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto<br class="calibre2"/>mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru<br class="calibre2"/>mām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam<br class="calibre2"/>ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 9.34]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is the <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> and Kṛṣṇa comes personally to establish it. And He makes distinction in the Fourth Chapter, <span class="Italic">dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata, abhyutthānam adharmasya [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He distinguishes between <span class="Italic">adharma</span> and <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And He's establishing at the end of Ninth Chapter that the <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is to become His devotee, to think of Him, to worship Him and to offer all obeisances to Him. And that persons who reject this <span class="Italic">dharma</span> or who have no information of this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> they have to revolve in the cycle of birth and death, not achieving Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The beginning is to understand this transmigration. But actually people do not understand. Cycle of birth and death, if one does not understand what is birth and death, what he'll understand of cycle of birth and death? Mostly because they do not understand what is birth and what is death, they are mostly going on on the bodily concept of life. That is animal life. Ask anybody. Bodily concept. And everything is going on. We pass through Canada to USA. Why Canada? Why USA? This bodily concept. It is meant for the Canadians, it is meant for USA, Americans. Immigration, customs, the same mentality as a dog coming from other neighborhood. The other dogs, they all come together, "<span class="Italic">Yow, yow,</span> why you have come, why you have come?" In civilized dress only. This is the position. What is the difference between the dog's mentality... When another dog comes to another neighborhood, these neighborhood dogs, you know that? All animals: "<span class="Italic">Yow,</span> why you have come?" So this department, "Why you have come here?" dogs barking, and this immigration, what is the difference? Is there any difference? This is our policy. Very difficult. [break] ...they will understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Their mentality is not better than the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's probably a lot worse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Worse, because animal has got some limit, but a human being who has developed consciousness, it is unlimited. Just like a thief is thief, but when an attorney-at-law is a thief, he's a very big thief. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When a man's educated to know the difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ordinary thief and educated thief. In your country there are many lawyers. Their only business is how to cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Every lawyer. Because they're trying to make money as well, only they're in a better position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big, big lawyers, through this real estatement. I have got bitter experience. People go to real estate man, he has got, say, five thousand dollars, and he wants to purchase one hundred thousand worth property. And they'll say, "Yes. We shall arrange." He will, in such a way, implicate, that he will take this five thousand dollars, and it will be divided amongst them. He will not give anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We lost quite a bit of property in Detroit because of that lawyer of Ambarīṣa's. That lawyer of Ambarīṣa's, when they did the Detroit deal, they said they lost quite a bit of movable property because the lawyer did a deal with the real estate agent to take it away for himself. He got that boat very cheap, and other things also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lawyer is thief, medical man is thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All thieves. They're all thieves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then whom to believe? Whom to believe, this is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The general public, they are becoming very bitter, very frustrated, because they can't turn to anyone for protection anymore. The government is the biggest thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dasyu-dharmabhiḥ.</span> It is stated that all government men will be rogues and thieves. <span class="Italic">Rājanyair dasyu-dharmabhiḥ. Rājanyaiḥ</span> means government men, and <span class="Italic">dasyu-dharma</span> means practiced to roguery, thieves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> American police are well known for being corrupt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. In India. Police means everyone takes, first of all (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> They can be saved only by your mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and the mercy of Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is by the mercy of Kṛṣṇa only you are saved. Otherwise, our Bombay construction was rejected by the police constable, that <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is nuisance. Public servant, he can say, blaspheme a religious system, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in the same country, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And India is condemning now, government men: "<span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> is nuisance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Temporarily, at least, it seems the demons are very powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will become powerful. And people will be less intelligent-means less God conscious. Just like when the king is weak, thieves and rogues, they flourish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So we just have to be very strong and uncompromising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can compromise with thieves and rogues? Boarding time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The flight leaves at 5:05. They'll call. They'll call when it's time. The plane doesn't appear to be here just yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although they are poor, still they can understand it easily, very easily, that you are not this body; there is God; if you don't become devotee, you'll remain in this material world. These things they will immediately understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How is it that, say, obviously they must be backed by very great pious activity, but somehow or other, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they have taken birth in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that special mercy that they seem to be impoverished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is that special arrangement that they seem to be impoverished? Say like the villagers, they're not very wealthy, or, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is due to misgovernment. There is no king; all rogues and thieves are in the government. Mismanagement. It is the government duty to see that everyone is doing nicely so that they can live peacefully, happily. There must be direction. Just like parentless children. Nobody is to take care; they'll be wretched. So India's position is like that. The parentless children. There is no good government. And they supply this control wheat that is not even touchable. Unfit for human consumption. There is a worm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Control wheat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They purchase from here and there all rejected wheat, and they supply it. There is no <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> no milk, no proper food grain. Everything black market. Any necessary commodity you cannot have in the open market; you have to purchase in black market. Just like for the building purpose, cement. In your country you can purchase any amount of it. You cannot purchase. You have to purchase black market, and that cement also mixed with some... What is that? And unless you give some bribe, it is not possible. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> ...for the balcony in the church in the other room? How can we... (announcement being made)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...fit for sitting. That is very nice. And next time when I come the seat should be just Deity altar, so that all balcony can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Seat should be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My seat should be near the altar of the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana.</span> Like in Los Angeles, at the side? On the left-hand side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not left-hand side. Just like you are facing Deity and there are spaces here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Between the doors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Which side, Śrīla Prabhupāda? On the left-hand side or the right-hand side of the Deity, facing towards the altar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Any side? How far away from the front? In the middle so that they can see from the balcony as well. (child calls out)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sounded like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sounded like it. I don't think it could have been though. Not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Child is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Could be Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's not. I see the child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He'll have the same benediction as Ajāmila. (child calls out "Prabhupāda")</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows me. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Should there be a canopy over top of the <span class="Italic">vyāsāsana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no canopy. [break] ...to fly to our New Vrindaban? How long it takes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I asked Kīrtanānanda. He said about one hour, twenty, twenty-five minutes. (break-new sequence in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us see what is the reception. [break] We have come from a different way. From Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, you had to come from Buffalo. [break] ...take to get to Buffalo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, only about an hour and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hour and half?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> To the airport from Toronto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> From leaving Toronto, we left one o'clock, and we arrived at, it was about two hours. We arrived just after three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Some devotees were there from Buffalo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> ...had a very nice place for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break] People are being kept in such an ignorant way that they do not care about sinful activities. They can do anything for sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Actually, there is no advancement of civilization. They are thinking, they are running on four-wheel motorcar, and the dog is running on four legs. What is the quality change? This is going on in the name of civilization, and people are kept in ignorance. Where is the advancement? Running by motorcar is advancement? They have no knowledge that there is next life, and "Today I am running on Ford car, tomorrow I may have to run like dog on four legs."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They do not think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is ignorance, this is ignorance. And they are kept, the whole world-the state, the father, the guardian, everyone, the priest. Everyone is ignorant. Dull-headed ignorant. And they are passing on as philosopher, scientist, religious leader. [break] ...hard to bring them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Taking these few years, fifty years or sixty years living here, and dance like dog and finish. There is no life. You die peacefully or (indistinct). And not dying peacefully, they cry. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> How to save them is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply chant. This is the only. Give them chance to come and chant with us, take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Then after few days or few months, let them understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have all got this experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have all got this experience. This is the only way. I started this movement on this determination, that they have nothing to give, simply by propaganda they are exacting so many people and befooling them. And I'll give them <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> nice chanting, and they will not come? They must come. This was my determination. And I began with this. So this is the only way. Give them chance "No talk, please come. Chant and dance with us and take <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasāda</span> and go home."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I think it was just ten years ago when I first met you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I never said that "You have to give up this, you have to do this." Never said. Then gradually <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> When the heart becomes cleansed, then little. There is no hopelessness. So many people have come, and they are coming. Both black, white, everyone is coming. There is no question of (indistinct). But you cannot expect that cent percent people will come; that is not possible. But even, even one-fourth percent people come to this, then it will be successful. Compared to the American population, what percentage we have got? Still they have made some impression, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Literatures are selling, they are appreciating, learned circle. Takes some time, but if we stick to our principles and do not make any compromise and push on-in this way, I have given you instruction, it will never stop; it will go on. It will never stop. At least for ten thousand years it will go on. That is your... (indistinct) And this movement is meant for these fourth-class, fifth-class, tenth-class men. Not this movement is fourth class, fifth class. They are so fallen that they cannot be counted even third class, fourth class-tenth-class of men. Deliver them. <span class="Italic">Patita-pāvana-hetu tava avatāra.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu's incarnation is for delivering these classes of men. Caitanya Mahāprabhu never meant to start this movement for high-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> sages, saintly persons-no. This class of men. For the all fallen. Don't be disappointed, go on, go on. Stick to the principles. When there was no response, I did not know where to live, where to eat. Sometimes at Dr. Mishra's, sometimes with some friend somewhere. Where to live. And I was going to inquire the shipping company when the next ship returning to India. Still I was renewing my visa: "Let us hope. Let us hope." In this way, we started Second Avenue in month of July, I think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> June or July.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, June or July, yes, June. Then Hayagrīva and Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja, they came first. Before that, Mukunda came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's the oldest devotee? Mukunda? He's the oldest devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There were others, they have left. That Mr. Green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Jagannātha dāsa. I think you named him Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Ravīndra-svarūpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Carl, Carl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Carl, yes. He has left. Washington directly? This road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Not Washington, D.C., this is Washington, Pennsylvania.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Pennsylvania state?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. The girls were saying that today at the airport was the most demoniac day they ever had.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Today was the most demoniac day at the airport they've ever had. They're getting very, very nasty. Every time they talked to someone, they come up and they say, "Don't take it. Don't take it. They're ripping you off. They're 'Moon' people."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Moon people"? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You know there's a lot of publicity right now about this Korean so-called spiritual master, Moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We just read one article in the <span class="Italic">U.S. News,</span> shows a picture, that man it describes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It is causing a big stir, these "Moon" people. He has just bought the hotel in New York for five millions dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is also against our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Well, I wouldn't say..., he never says anything about our movement. But they are equating us with him. The public is sometimes equating us with him and these other rascals. He claims that Jesus Christ never lived to fulfill his mission, which was to establish the perfect family. They killed him before he got married. So he has come, and he has all these wives. At least he used to, all his, whenever any of his disciples would get married, first he would have their wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they're doing that? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> People cannot distinguish between what is true and what is bogus. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...sophistication. [break] ...reminds me of a place in Germany. Heidelburg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like New Vrindaban?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, you'll find so many places in this country named... This probably was originally a settlement of German people. [break] I don't know. It was a chemical plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These things are not required at all, but they have created. They are called <span class="Italic">anartha,</span> unnecessarily diverting valuable attention of the human being to waste their time and energy and next life become a dog. That they do not know. This science is unknown to them. They'll believe, "This life finished, everything finished. That's all." [break] ...is working. That they do not know. Life is eternal, and how they are under the cycle of birth and death, nothing. <span class="Italic">Yāvad jīvet sukhaṁ jīvet.(?)</span> Cārvāka philosophy. So long you live, live happily. But actually they are not living happily. To work in this factory is not happy. They are not happy men. But they are thinking they are happy. Just like the hog eating stool, he is happy. This is gross ignorance. Actually, therefore, there is revolt against these capitalist. There is another unhappiness. Now there is strike. So where is happiness? If there is happiness, why there is strike? Why there is so many strikes? Why there is protest? There is no happiness. But they are thinking... Whole thing is based on ignorance, <span class="Italic">māyā. Anartha upaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.</span> And the direct method for subduing these <span class="Italic">anarthas,</span> unnecessary troubles-<span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> There is no other. <span class="Italic">Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje, lokasya ajānataḥ [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> People do not know it. <span class="Italic">Vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.</span> Therefore Vyāsadeva, most learned scholar, he has made this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How many chapters is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty-four. Half-finished, half-finished, Eighth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> What is Eighth Canto like? What does Eighth Canto contain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighth Canto? Churning of the ocean and producing nectar, and the demons they did not receive the nectar. There was fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And the story of Gajendra as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gajendra, that is I think Seventh Canto, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Beginning of the Eighth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gajendra also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means four parts. That means four books for the Eighth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Each volume is more wonderful. Each volume...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aḥ? Oh, yes. There is no comparison of this literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I think before you came, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> was unknown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unknown, yes. The Ramakrishna Mission published one <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> commentary. You know that? Farce. They, these Ramakrishna Mission people have done the greatest harm to the Vedic culture. Of course it is not taken very seriously, Ramakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they publicized in India that they have made all, everyone In India they were doing like that.

In our temple, thousands and thousands of foreign boys and girls are coming, and who is going there?
