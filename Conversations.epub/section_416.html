<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said, "You write in your books that your movement by Lord Caitanya is the..., as if it's the most exclusive thing." He said, "But actually, in India the Rāmānuja is a more prominent Vaiṣṇava sect." So, as I understand our claim, it's based on the fact that we worship Kṛṣṇa in a higher form, in Kṛṣṇaloka, and they worship Kṛṣṇa which leads to Vaikuṇṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...quarter there is no cinema song. <span class="Italic">Bhaja gopālam.</span> (there is music playing in background, recording of a boy or woman singing <span class="Italic">"bhaja gopāla</span>")</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīnivāsa (?) said every... [break] ...is controlled by the temple here. Even the government doesn't control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is all temple here around (indistinct). [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...prominence. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We came here yesterday. We went to the temple three times and just for a long...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> This is my wife and daughter. You came yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I came yesterday at about eleven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We saw you in the evening going to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is very nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Very nice, beautiful place. Very inspiring. Where's (indistinct) American? (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am, of course, Indian, but I have got my headquarters in America. (chuckles) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> America. (chuckles) I think I have seen you at Bombay once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Bombay I have got my headquarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And your friends were there at the airport, Santa Cruz Airport, and you came by plane, some two years back I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am going every year. Two times, three times, I have to go all round the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I respectfully request you your name, please.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. That's all. Call me Prabhupāda. I am preaching this cult, what you have come to see, this being expanded all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, yes. It's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have got about hundred temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> At every America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, all over the world. In America I have got forty temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Forty temples, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In England we have got about five. And France, in German, we have got four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> In Germany also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Germany, Sweden, Rome, and Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They are also... They are very devoted to our creed, our religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śa...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. That is the only religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is not religion. It is cheating. Only religion is to surrender to the Lord. That is religion. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I am a Vaiṣṇavite, you see. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvāṁ pāpebhyo...</span> [Bg. 18.66].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, religion. That is religion. <span class="Italic">Mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Oṁ namo nārāyaṇa</span> (recites <span class="Italic">mantra</span>). These are our, is our <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, you are Vaiṣṇava. The Vaiṣṇava, that is real form of religion. Others, they are not religion. It has been rejected in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra [SB 1.1.2]. Atra, kaitavaḥ</span> religion is rejected. <span class="Italic">Kaitavaḥ</span> means cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We have to surrender ourselves to God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Religion means the codes and the laws given by the Lord. That is religion. So if one does not surrender to the Lord, then what kind of religion it is? It is not religion. Just like good citizen means who abides by the law of the state. If he does not care for the laws, then what kind of good citizen he is? Similarly, if one does not surrender to the Supreme, then his religion has no meaning. It is simply cheating, that's all. What is your name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Raja Gopal Iyengar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
