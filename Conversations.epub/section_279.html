<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make show. So we should not increase the show very, very much. Show shortcut show. That's all. Real business is... <span class="Italic">Āula, bāula, kartābhajā, neḍā, daraveśa, sāṅi sahajiyā, sakhībhekī, smārta, jāta-gosāñi,</span> they have been condemned by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, <span class="Italic">smārta</span> and <span class="Italic">jāta-gosāñi.</span> <span class="Italic">Smārta-paṇḍita,</span> very serious about performing ceremonial rituals, they are called <span class="Italic">smārtas.</span> This <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,</span> also <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-smṛti,</span> that is also imitation of <span class="Italic">smārtaism. It is called smṛti.</span> So at least in Europe and America, they will never be able to take all these things. The things should be made shortcut; at the same time, they should be successful. So that is chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> depending on... As soon as we have got some time, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Either loudly or silent... As far as possible loudly; if not possible, silently. But the tongue must go, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. The tongue must work. And as far as possible, should be heard... That is... And officially, <span class="Italic">krkshaharama </span>(Prabhupāda chants very fast with words running into each other indistinctly). Not like that (chants again like that) Not like that. That will not... Every word should be distinctly chanted and heard, not official. So stress on this point. As far as possible, people should be encouraged to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> and try to bring the ecstasy and dance. Even there is no ecstasy, dance, it will bring ecstasy. Dancing is so nice. Chanting, dancing and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Take rest. That's all. Not that you shall take rest like Kumbhakarṇa. (Prabhupāda laughs) Just to, I mean to say, answer the call of this deficient body, we have to take little rest. But as far as possible this should be conquered. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. The Gosvāmīs, they conquered over eating, sleeping... Stress on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> and let them chant and dance as long as possible. If they can chant and dance twenty-four hours, that is very good. That should be stressed. Just see, this boy yesterday, he came, he said, "Oh, I like this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> very much." Immediately. He was talking of so much, yoga and this and that, so many nonsense, but he came this morning. He said, "Oh, I will come again. It is very nice." <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> has got so power. Stress on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> chant yourself, induce others, dance. Whole thing will be a successful. And especially outside India, these rituals and ceremonials, that will be simply artificial. They cannot take it seriously. But <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> they can take seriously. This is practical. And if you recite all the Vedic hymns throughout the whole day they will join, but they will not benefit out of it. So why should we waste. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. (Prabhupāda laughs) Prabhupāda, regarding Pradyumna's work on the Third Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> There are some synonyms, and when they are finished then the book can be published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he will never finish, so what... (end)</div>
