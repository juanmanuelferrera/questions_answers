<div class="Heading">Interview with Professors<br class="calibre2"/>O'Connell, Motilal and Shivaram<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 18, 1976, Toronto</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> ...Professor O'Connell came over to the temple when this, some man came, Ted Patrick, he came to Toronto last year-I think we told you about it-and he took one of our devotees and deprogrammed her. There was big publicity in the paper for an entire week. So Professor O'Connell came forward and spoke on behalf of our movement, saying that he felt that it was a bona fide system of Vaiṣṇavism. He came to the temple and assisted us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> O'Connell knows me from a such long time. Yes. We first met in Harvard University. Next he saw me in London, Bhaktivedanta Manor. I think Boston also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's interested in Vaiṣṇava philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes, he wrote his thesis on Caitanya Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has got his doctorate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes. He's bringing one other professor with him. I can't remember his name. He's rather important. He just got a post at Oxford University, has been granted, er, uh, and from Oxford they've asked him to come from Toronto to there. So he'll also be with Professor O'Connell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is Professor Shivaram from McMaster University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I saw you quite before this. Thank you. But I.... (devotee or Indian introduces several people, including Mr. and Mrs. Mukherjee) Mrs. Mukherjee, you're also teacher here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> No, I am a student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They're all from Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (converses with woman in Bengali, mentions Gauḍīya Maṭha) So what I was talking just now about this motorcar race?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. This breakneck civilization. Just like dog, they're very, very busy. If you watch a dog, sometimes you'll see he's running here, running there, running here, running there. But no credit. Similarly, the modern scientists, they're running, running, running, very busy, but simply patchwork. They have no conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was talking of these cars. The dog is running on legs, and they are running on cars. So, (laughs) actually what is the difference? This is advancement of civilization, that the dog is running for nothing, here and there on legs, and human being is running on nice car. Does it mean there is advance in civilization? If we keep the human being like cats and dogs, without any advancement of knowledge, the cats and dogs, they cannot accept any advanced knowledge. That is not possible. Similarly, if human society is kept in darkness without any advanced knowledge, without any knowledge of the aim of life and without any knowledge what is the meaning of human life, they'll remain as cats and dogs. So as cats and dogs, if they are practiced to run here and there, either on legs or on cars, is that advancement of civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Swami, there was a news item in the paper last year, some research scholars at Jesuit University performed some experiments, and then they said that Kṛṣṇa consciousness people lose initiative for doing things. They don't fight the battle of life. It takes away the initiative from them. It was published in papers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's not the fact. It is misunderstanding. We are actually struggling for achievement of the highest goal of life. Otherwise, why we are writing so many books? It is for the human beings. And they are being accepted. It is not for the cats and dog. This <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> is not meant for the cats and dogs. So, <span class="Italic">vidyā bhāgavatāvadhi.</span> In the beginning it is said, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇāṁ satāṁ vedyaṁ vāstavam atra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">. Atra śrīmad-bhāgavataṁ vāstava-vastu-vedyam,</span> what is actual life. So we are struggling to give people what is actual life. Kṛṣṇa comes down to teach us what is actual life. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When people become cats and dogs, <span class="Italic">dharmasya glāniḥ. Dharmasya glāniḥ</span> means cats and dogs, because in the cats and dog society there is no question of <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> They simply jump over and enjoy life. Eat, drink, be merry, enjoy eating, sleeping, sex and defense. That's all. So if human life is also trained up in a polished way, the same principles, then where is the difference between cats and dogs? Dog is thinking, "I am this body, hound, greyhound," and barking, <span class="Italic">"gow, gow."</span> Similarly, if we remain like that, in the bodily concept of life, that "I am this body," "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," then where is the difference between dog and ourself? The human life is meant for understanding that I am neither Hindu nor Muslim nor American nor Indian. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> That is beginning of life. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> And what is Brahman? Then life begins. The cats and dogs, they cannot think that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul." That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> When Arjuna was thinking in the bodily concept of life, "My family, my brother," and so on, so on, so he declined to fight. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, Professor O'Connell and his wife are here to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, come on. Hare Kṛṣṇa, take this. I saw you last in London, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> We did, at your suburban place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivedanta Manor, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> We were out for a morning walk. But you got out ahead of us, so Pradyumna and I did not quite catch you, but we followed your trail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pradyumna was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> My wife was with me-you probably remember Kathleen O'Connell-and Professor and Mrs. Fendrick. Mr. Fendrick teaches at Riason University in Toronto. Mary Jane Fendrick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if we keep the human society in darkness about the aim of life, that is not civilization. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> I think you understand Sanskrit. <span class="Italic">Svārtha-gatim,</span> the real self-interest, is to go back to home, back to Godhead. For that purpose, the human life is given by nature as an opportunity in the cycle of birth and death. So if we don't take advantage of this human form of life, when we can realize God and go back to home, back to Godhead, then it is misused. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They're enamored by the external energy of God, this material energy, and they are thinking that utilizing the material energy, the dog is running on his legs, and if he can run on motorcar, that is advancement. But the business is the running, without any purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is it not better to run than to stand still and sleep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, running is not stopped, but running must be with some purpose, aim of life. That they do not know. They are missing the aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I meant, Swamiji, <span class="Italic">rajas</span> is a better manifestation than <span class="Italic">tamas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to go above <span class="Italic">rajas-tamaḥ. Rajas-tamaḥ</span> means greediness and lust.</div>
<div class="Verse">tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāma-lobhādayaś ca ye<br class="calibre2"/>ceta etair anāviddhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sthitaṁ sattve prasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.19]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">If you want peace and happiness, then you have to transcend the platform of <span class="Italic">rajas-tamaḥ</span> and come to the platform of goodness. Then you have to transcend the goodness platform and come to the <i class="calibre3">vasudeva</i> platform, Kṛṣṇa consciousness platform. This is progress. <span class="Italic">Tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobha. Rajas tamas</span> means <span class="Italic">kāma</span> and <span class="Italic">lobha,</span> endless greediness and endless lusty desires. That will keep us within the category of material existence. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā janmani janmani aprāpya mām</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then we remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> life after life. That is not the aim of human life. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> We take once type of body and struggle and again die, and again accept another, another type of body. There are 8,400,000 different types of body. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is the beginning of spiritual education. One has to learn it, that "I'm not this body; I'm within this body, and I'm transmigrating from one body to another." That means repetition of birth, death, old age and disease. This is the main problem of life. So human life means to make a solution of these problems, not to be entangled with these problems again and again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The question is, one must be able to see if there's a problem. People don't see it as a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "Here is your problem: <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span>" Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, find out. This is knowledge. Advancement of knowledge means one must be able to see that what are the actual problems. Just like the scientists, the philosophers, they're trying to solve so many problems. But first of all, fix up what is the problem. Temporary problem, to make a solution, that is going on. But actual problem is this: <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> The soul is not destroyed, <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit,</span> at any time. One should be very prudent to see that "If I have no birth and no death, then what is this nonsense, birth and death?" That is knowledge. Why I am dying? Why there is birth problem? Why there is death problem? And as soon as there is birth problem, there is disease problem, there is old age problem. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says.... What is the <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> It's in the list of items of knowledge, "The perception of the evil of birth, death, old age and disease."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the cure, medicine, is also given: <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, then.... Everyone has to give up this body, but a person who is in thorough knowledge of Kṛṣṇa, then he, after giving up this body, he does not accept any more material body. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out his verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> "One who knows the transcendental nature of My appearance and activities does not, upon leaving the body, take his birth again in this material world, but attains My eternal abode, O Arjuna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the solution. Therefore our only business should be to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection of life. That makes the solution-<span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Our propaganda is how to understand Kṛṣṇa. And this yoga, Kṛṣṇa consciousness yoga, simply thinking of Kṛṣṇa, and try to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is explained.</div>
<div class="Verse">mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Without any doubt. And if you, <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ mām,</span> if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are therefore requesting everyone, study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Don't interpret. Don't screw out your concocted meaning. Then your life is successful. Every politician, every scholar, everyone is trying to screw out some meaning. That is the disease. But we say, we are begging people, that "You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> As It Is and try to understand it." Very simple thing. We haven't got to become very learned scholars. Our business is to go to you and request you, "Please read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Don't try to interpret it." That is our preaching. Very simple. Because <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the instruction is there, and we haven't got to manufacture anything. So as a peon, we carry only: "You please read it as it is." Or you try to explain as it is. And where is the explanation? Everything is clear. The beginning is,</div>
<div class="Verse">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre<br class="calibre2"/>samavetā yuyutsavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva<br class="calibre2"/>kim akurvata sañjaya<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 1.1]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">Sañjaya is asking, Dhṛtarāṣṭra is asking Sañjaya, that "My sons and my brother's sons, both of them assembled together for fighting, then what did they do?" And they assembled in the <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre,</span> Kurukṣetra. That place is still there, Kurukṣetra. You have been in India. And the Kurukṣetra station is there, and people are still going by thousands to Kurukṣetra as a <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra.</span> So where is the difficulty to understand the meaning of these two words, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre, kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1]</span>? Why you should interpret "<span class="Italic">Kuru-kṣetre</span> means this, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre</span> means this"? Why? Mislead others and mislead himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It must be understood literally, you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Suppose you have got some philosophy. So you can explain your philosophy differently. Why should you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and explain your philosophy? Is it honesty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have been doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> are doing it. All lower-class men. No <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> do it. Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, these are <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Śaṅkarācārya, Caitanya, they never did it. Outsiders, who did not care for the authority of the <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> they did it. Otherwise, we are the <span class="Italic">ācārya sampradāya.</span> They'll never do that. <span class="Italic">Ācāryavān puruṣo veda. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> That is bona fide process of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanam. Amānitvam adambhitvam. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> This is the process of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the <span class="Italic">ācārya. Ācārya</span> will never interpret things like that. You see Rāmānujācārya's comments on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Nothing changed. But in every <span class="Italic">śloka</span> he has given evidence from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> from the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads. Ācārya</span> will never change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In the list of items of knowledge, "approaching a bona fide spiritual master." <span class="Italic">Ācāryopāsanam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Swamiji, you think <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the solution to the problem of the world today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes. That is your natural position. You are protected, and God is protector. That's a fact. You cannot live even for a moment without protection of God. That is your position. That is explained by Caitanya Mahāprabhu: <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> Perhaps you have read it in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> You have read <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta?</span> Yes. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, He immediately gives the definition and position of the living entity: <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa.</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī asked Him, "People glorify me that I am very learned scholar." <span class="Italic">Grāmya-vyavahāre kahe paṇḍita satya kari' māni.</span> You understand Bengali? <span class="Italic">Grāmya-vyavahāre kahe paṇḍita.</span> "My these neighbors, they call me <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> And I accept, 'Yes, I am <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span>' But I am such a <span class="Italic">paṇḍita," āpanāra hitāhita kichui nā jāni,</span> "I do not know what is my aim of life and what is good for me. I'm such a <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span>" Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu answered, <span class="Italic">'ke āmi,' 'kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya' ihā nāhi jāni kemane hita haya.</span> So mistake is, Caitanya Mahāprabhu immediately pointed out, that "You are learned, of course, there is no doubt, but you are submitting yourself as others..." Now He said that "You have questioned that <span class="Italic">ke āmi,</span> 'Who I am?' " So He said that "You are servant of God. That is your real identification." Then He begins teaching. So our position is servant of God. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān. Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> One singular number and plural number, <span class="Italic">ceta,</span> eternal. The singular number <span class="Italic">cetana</span> is the maintainer, and the plural number <span class="Italic">cetana</span> is the maintained. So our position is maintained. Just like father maintains the children. That is natural. And children's duty is to remain obedient to the father. That's all. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Then the family is all right. Family means father, mother and children. They're missing.... The children they are seeing, the mother they are seeing, and they are saying there is no father. This is modern civilization. How is that? The children are there, the mother is there. How is that there is no father? What is this conclusion? A sane man's conclusion is if the children are there, the mother is there, there must be father. Without father, how mother can beget children? Is there any experience that without father, mother has given birth to children? The modern civilization is: mother is material nature and we are all sons, born in the womb of the material nature. So who is the father? That inquiry is lacking. But there is father, undoubtedly. And the answer is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ tāsāṁ mahad yonir brahma, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā. Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> "It should be understood that all species of life, O son of Kuntī, are made possible by birth in this material nature, and that I am the seed-giving father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. And that is the root cause of all problems, that they are missing the father. He is the maintainer. Godless. Is it possible that the mother gives birth to a child without father? Is there any experience in the history of the world, the mother has given birth to a child without connection with the father? They say, "We have not seen father." That does not mean there is no father. A child may not have seen his father. There are many children, but that does not mean that he has no father. There must be father. And so if there is father, no father, how you know it? Suppose you have not seen. You ask the mother, "Mother, am I born without father?" Mother says, "No, you have got your father." Or she can show, "Here is your father." So you cannot understand the father by your research work. You have to take the knowledge from the mother, authority. There is no other way. You cannot make any experiment or research knowledge who is father. That is not possible. You'll never understand who is father. You have to take the authority of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> to understand what is God, or what is the supreme father. And here in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the supreme father personally is coming and teaching you, "I am the father." So what is the objection to accepting Him? All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have accepted, as you spoke of the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu has accepted. So what is my objection? That means I am defying all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> All the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam. Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> And this is supported by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> Swamiji, could you speak a bit about the proper attitude of the child towards the father? Is it one of fear, respect, love?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Love. Basic relation love. Father loves the child, naturally. The child also naturally loves the father. This is natural relationship. Father works whole day and night for maintaining the children, family, and if the child out of love takes his lozenges and offers to the father, "Father, it is very nice, you take," father will be very glad. "Oh, yes, yes, I'll take." Father does not require the lozenges, but out of love the small child offering a little lozenges, father is very glad: "Oh, this child loves me." So Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati tad aham aśnāmi [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is relationship. Even the poorest man, he can offer to Kṛṣṇa a little flower, little fruit, and Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, if it is offered with love, I accept it." That is the relation. What Kṛṣṇa has got to do with little flower and little fruits? But He accepts, <span class="Italic">tad aham aśnāmi.</span> He said. <span class="Italic">Bhakty-upahṛtam.</span> "Because he has brought it with love and devotion, I accept it." If the supreme father accepts from you something, then your life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> The human children often play with their fathers. Is playfulness the proper attitude for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not play, that is real love. Just like father sometimes becomes a horse, and the child rides over, and father enjoys. There is a story about Prime Minister Gladstone. He was prime minister, so many people come to him. So one man came and the doorman said, "He is now busy. Wait." So he was waiting for one hour. Then he became impatient; he wanted to see what this gentleman is doing. So he saw that he has become a horse, and his grandchild is driving him. So why the prime minister had become a horse to take back his grandchild on the back and enjoy? Is it a horse? This is out of love, enjoying. He was not wasting time. The other visitors were waiting. This is love. So to revive that natural life is the opportunity in human life. We have distributed our love in so many material things. Therefore Kṛṣṇa comes and directly speaks that "You withdraw all these nonsense activities." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Try to love Me. Then your life is successful." This is <span class="Italic">āśliṣya.</span> Personally requested that "Why you are rotting in this material world of birth and death and manufacturing so many ways of life? You give up all this nonsense. Just surrender to Me, you'll be happy." This is natural.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">So the teachings are there, the process is there, and Caitanya Mahāprabhu is practical demonstration of the teachings.

<div class="Purp-para">So Kṛṣṇa comes Himself to teach what is God and what is the relationship with God. And people still mistake. Therefore He comes as devotee, how to teach people how to approach Kṛṣṇa. These things are there. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, to understand Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Otherwise, it is very difficult. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> And Caitanya Mahāprabhu especially appeared to give Kṛṣṇa. Therefore if we go through Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we understand Kṛṣṇa very quickly. And as soon as we understand Kṛṣṇa, we become liberated. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> the whole solution of all problems.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Motilal.

That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission-<span class="Italic">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma.</span> So you Indians, you are here, you assimilate the teachings of <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> and help these people.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Swamiji, would you say something about the place of women in your movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no distinction between man and woman.

Because in the spiritual platform there is no such distinction, man, woman, or black, white, or big or small. No. Everyone is spirit soul. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim.</span> Not only come, she can also attain perfection. There is no such restriction. Kṛṣṇa said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Do you have any <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> in the Western movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many Western woman, girls, in our society. They are chanting, dancing, taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Of course, because superficially, bodily, there is some distinction, so we keep women separately from men, that's all. Otherwise, the rights are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> Is it possible, Swamiji, for a woman to be a guru in the line of disciplic succession?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jāhnavā devī was-Nityānanda's wife. She became. If she is able to go to the highest perfection of life, why it is not possible to become guru? But, not so many. Actually one who has attained the perfection, she can become guru. But man or woman, unless one has attained the perfection.... <span class="Italic">Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> The qualification of guru is that he must be fully cognizant of the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then he or she can become guru. <span class="Italic">Yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā, sei guru haya.</span> [break] In our material world, is it any prohibition that woman cannot become professor? If she is qualified, she can become professor. What is the wrong there? She must be qualified. That is the position. So similarly, if the woman understands Kṛṣṇa consciousness perfectly, she can become guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, to understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness, do you not require <span class="Italic">adhikārī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adhikārī</span> means he must agree to understand. That is <span class="Italic">adhikārī.</span> But we do not agree. That is our fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is this agreement due to learning or out of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> you surrender, you become qualified. You agree, "Yes, I surrender, Kṛṣṇa says." Then immediately you become qualified. But that you do not do. Kṛṣṇa is personally canvassing, but we are not agreeing. What can be done? If I say, with a bag of million dollars, "Take this bag," if you don't agree, then you remain poor man. But you agree, "Yes, without any labor I'm getting the million dollars. Well, all right." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> To come to that Kṛṣṇa consciousness rightly and surrender to Kṛṣṇa, it takes many millions of births. But if one is intelligent, if this is the ultimate goal, that one has to come to this point, to surrender to Vāsudeva, why not do it immediately? That is intelligence. That is intelligence. Kṛṣṇa is canvassing. One has to take millions of births to come to this point, and Kṛṣṇa is personally promising, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why not take advantage? That means you do not agree. If you agree, the result is immediate. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are thinking, "Ah, Kṛṣṇa is also human being like me. Why shall I surrender to Him?" They are <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ.</span> Then remain a rascal. What can be done? We have got little independence, because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is fully independent. But because we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, we have got little independence, so we can refuse. Although Kṛṣṇa canvassing, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> we can refuse: "Why shall I surrender to You?" That is our misfortune. But if you agree, you get immediate result. Therefore this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> To agree, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Because we have got so many nasty, dirty things within our heart, we cannot agree. But if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, then we become cleansed in heart, and then agree. Those who are not agreeing, for them it is recommended, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">. Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalaṁ kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Because Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's name is not different, by association of Kṛṣṇa you become purified. Then you understand, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> You become the greatest <span class="Italic">mahātmā:</span> "Oh, Kṛṣṇa is everything." Then you surrender. You have to surrender-today or tomorrow or many millions of births after. You have to do that. Otherwise, you'll be troubled by the laws of material nature.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">So we have to come to that point, how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That is nature's way, pulling by the ear: "Come here, do this." <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> This will go on as long as you are not agreeing to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. And as soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, there is no infringement by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break] (Bengali) You understand Bengali? So the process is going on by the laws of nature to give us different types of trouble. The main trouble is <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span> It will go on unless we surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Better surrender in this life and be perfect; then things are all right. And what is the benefit of our so-called independence? If we declare that we are independent of the laws of nature, is it possible? Is it possible? Then where is your independence? Why you are declaring falsely independence? If you declare yourself independent of God, then you become dependent on <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like the criminals. They don't care for the laws of the government. They become under the laws of the prison house, that's all. There is no question of independence. Either you remain free or in the prison house, you are under the laws of government. So why falsely declaring independent and don't care for the government? Outlaws. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā</span>-false prestige which is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, you came to New York, I believe, in 1965. Can you remember some of your first impressions of North American society when you came here? Did you feel it was ripe for Kṛṣṇa consciousness at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I was not very much hopeful. That I wrote one poetry, that "Kṛṣṇa, why You have brought me in this country? What can I do? How I shall convince them how they will understand the philosophy? So, but because You have brought me here, must be there is some purpose. So all right. You make me dance as You like." That poetry, I (wrote) in Boston, Commonwealth Pier, on the sea. I came by ship. So I wrote that poetry, that I do not know what for I have come here, why Kṛṣṇa has brought me here. As soon as I shall say that there is no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no drinking, and no gambling, they'll say, "You go home. Don't talk." I knew this. Still I attempted. But these boys kindly accepted. I never made any compromise. I said, "These are the first conditions to become Kṛṣṇa conscious: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. Are you agreed?" They say yes, then come. If I would have made compromise, "Yes, whatever you like you can do." No, I never did. Ask them. I never did. Some of them left, that "It is too difficult. The primary necessities of life are denied here." (chuckles) But these boys, they have accepted, and therefore it is improving. They are young men, they have got all the desires for material enjoyment, but they have sacrificed everything. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to purify your existence, then you must practice <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa yamena niyamena [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> First beginning is <span class="Italic">brahmacarya.</span> Therefore according to Vedic system, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> first-to teach how to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī. Brahmacārī guru-gṛhe vasan dānto guror hitam.</span> The children should be trained up in such a way that they will be able to control the senses and act only for the benefit of guru. That is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> They have no personal interest. So they are collecting daily not less than one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees, up to five <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> these boys. But their expenditure at my direction. Not a single paisa they can spend in their own discretion. They are laboring hard to get this collection, but the money is mine. This is the arrangement. Now in Hyderabad they immediately require two <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> The money is there, they can take it, but they are asking by telegram my permission. I'll give them, but this is the arrangement. <span class="Italic">Guror hitam, brahmacārī. Vasan dānto guror hitam.</span> So the prescription is there, the formula is there, the literature is there. If we take this culture, then the whole human society will be happy. That is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> Do you find, Swamiji, that the mood of the young people in North America is the same now as it was in '65, or has it changed?</div>

Is there any tax if you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? Just make an experiment and see the result. There is no loss, there is no tax, there is no botheration. Why don't you do it? Not at all difficult. If you compare with other system, this is the easiest. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not like.... Just like in college, school, some student making rapid progress, some of them are a little slow. That does not mean that he should he rejected. He should be given chance. But if he follows the regulative principles, there is no chance of falling down. The regulative principle is that you refrain from these activities: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That will make him perfect. Very easy. We don't say no sex; we say illicit sex. So if you want sex, you become a gentleman, marry and live like a gentleman. Why illicit sex? There are many <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotee. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu's direct associate, Nityānanda, He was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He married twice. First wife died, he married second wife. So <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> is not rejected. Simply it is not that simply <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> will go back to home. No. Everyone can go. <span class="Italic">Striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyāḥ.</span> They can go also. But one must be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's recommendation is that you remain your place-don't try to change it artificially-but be Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is required. And that is also very easy, how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> you become Kṛṣṇa conscious. At home or out of home, it doesn't matter. <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> You remain in your situation, place, and <span class="Italic">śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāk,</span> and hear, just lend your aural reception of the words of Kṛṣṇa. So that day will come, Kṛṣṇa, who is <span class="Italic">ajita,</span> you can conquer Him. <span class="Italic">Ajito 'pi jito 'py asi.</span> Nobody can conquer Kṛṣṇa, but by this method, one can conquer Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, would you know whether people who joined the movement in their older years are more likely to stay on than those who join when they are younger?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. Younger, older, there is no restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It doesn't appeal more to the young ones than to the older people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, any education, if you take young, youthtime, that is easily. For old man it is difficult, but he has to take so many years to forget what he has learned. (laughter) That is the difficulty. Young man, they are easily receptive. Old man thinks, "Why shall I give up my present understanding?" That is the difficulty. But if he gives up and takes to, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> if he takes to it, then immediately, in a moment. So this is, this plate is for me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, keep it and I shall.... At least I shall see. It is for you, take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, it's for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He'll save this for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nice. And no tea, no liquor. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ.</span> If the professors chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, naturally the students will do that. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tad tad eva itaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Less important person also follow. If the professor's chanting, the student will immediately follow. You can do better service. If I go, I request them, they'll not do it. But as soon as they: "My professor is doing. All right. Immediately."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> (to other professor) Do you have such devotion among your students in McMaster? You don't see much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> We had a graduation ceremony today down at the University. I've just come up from it. Are you going to send any of your students to the University to get their doctoral studies so that they can teach at other universities? We'd be delighted if some would come this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> One boy, Garuḍa dāsa, is going to study at the University of Chicago for his Ph.D. in Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> Good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real education is life. <span class="Italic">Gurukula</span> means it is a way of life training. It is said that <span class="Italic">brahmacārī gurukule vasan dānta.</span> This is the way of life: how to learn controlling the senses. Nowadays we have got school, colleges, universities, but this method is not there, how to become <span class="Italic">dānta.</span> The method is different, that "You can do whatever you like; you simply attend class." That is not the way of life. This is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>śamena ca damena ca<br class="calibre2"/>tyāgena satya-śaucābhyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yamena niyamena vā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.13]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> This can be done.</div>
<div class="Verse">kecit kevalayā bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>vāsudeva-parāyaṇāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena<br class="calibre2"/>nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">All these things, <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> can be executed simply by learning devotional service. Then everything is there. <span class="Italic">Kecit kevalayā bhaktyā.</span> So we are describing these things in our books. If these books are made textbook.... I think in some of the colleges they are making textbooks, our books, in Germany, in Hamburg University. There is university of the name Hamburg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> East Berlin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have taken some of our books for textbook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> There is a German gentleman, Walter Eidlitz, who wrote in German a life of Śrī Caitanya some years ago. Did he ever meet you, by any chance, Walter Eidlitz?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> He spent some time in Vṛndāvana during the Second War, became a Vaiṣṇava, devotee, I believe, and then wrote this lengthy German life of Caitanya. I don't think it's translated yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one, my Godbrothers also, you perhaps know, Sadānanda. He came to India in 1935, Gauḍīya Maṭha. And my Guru Mahārāja first initiated him with <span class="Italic">hari-nāma.</span> Two gentlemen came: one Ernst Schulze, another Von something. But later on they left. This Schulze was my intimate friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> One of your Godbrothers was in Toronto about this time last year, Swami Bhakti-hṛdaya Bon Mahārāja was passing through Toronto. Your devotees came over to the house and were very courteous to him and invited him back to the temple, and he was very pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I wrote him care of your address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I invited him to Hawaii, but by that time he left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> His plans were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swami, do you attach any significance to the fact that this temple is in a form of a Christian church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many Christian church we have converted temple. They sell for want of customer. And we purchase, we increase customers. But customer of the same place. That is the beauty. These customers, they are not brought from India. But formerly they were not coming here, now they are coming in crowd. In Los Angeles we purchased.... You have been in Los Angeles? Now we have got a regular colony. About one dozen big, big houses. So that was a church. Nobody was coming, they sold it to us. Now it is always crowded. This church, they were not going to sell us. But (laughs) under circumstances it came to us. We wanted to purchase it, but the proprietor would not sell to us. They were charging very big price. So we are prepared. Still he'll not agree. Now we have purchased less price. (to devotee:) What is the history?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, the previous owner didn't want to sell it to the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They said they'd prefer to burn it down. (Prabhupāda laughs) One Indian gentleman who is a prominent businessman in Toronto purchased it in trust, saying that he was representing some Indian social group. So he purchased it in trust. Then the chairman of the committee of trustees who were in charge of selling the church noticed some <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> on Viśvakarmā's face. He had a hat on so his <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> wouldn't show. When he saw it was Hare Kṛṣṇa, he became very disturbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> He said, "Oh, no, the Hare Kṛṣṇas."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are not very favorable to the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> How long did it take for Swamiji to write the seventeen volumes, translation of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can be finished, but I have to look after this management, that is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's asking about the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛtas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā,</span> it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How long did it take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It took one year and six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> When do you usually write?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I write in the night. I get up at half past twelve. I go to bed at half past ten, and I get up at half past twelve. Then I finish my chanting, if there is any balance, and then I begin dictating. And the morning they take it and type it. So this dictaphone is always with me, wherever I go, so my writing book is not stopped. Maybe few pages, but something is there daily. Little drops of water wears the stone. So in that way we have translated so many books. About fifty-four books are already published, besides the small booklets. And, how many we have published, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>? About twenty-two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Twenty volumes, and two more in print now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore twenty-two. I am expecting sixty volumes. Sixty volumes of four hundred pages. The biggest canto is the Tenth Canto. I've already published the Tenth Canto, summarized: <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span>. But in detail, it will take at least twenty volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> It's almost as big as the rest of the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Tenth is almost as big as the rest of the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are ninety chapters. Ninety chapters. All other cantos, at most thirty chapters. But Tenth Canto is ninety chapters. That is Kṛṣṇa's face, Kṛṣṇa's beautiful face. Everyone is attracted by the smiling face of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is there any other <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> other than Baladeva-<span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, many others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Gauḍīya, Śaṅkara...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, other <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya and Vallabhācārya. Then our <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya-bhāṣya,</span> this Jīva Gosvāmī, Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura. And Rādhāramaṇa Gosvāmī, Gopāla Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmī's descendant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is there any plan to translate into English? Is there any plan to translate Jīva Gosvāmī's <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhāṣya</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I am taking help from all these Gosvāmīs and giving a summary. Where is that book? That green book? (probably referring to Prabhupāda's green <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> with eight commentaries) [break] First comment I find, Viśvanātha Cakravartī and Vīra-rāghavācārya, the Rāmānujācārya sampradāya. Vīra-rāghavācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Ādhunika bhāṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not <span class="Italic">ādhunika.</span> It was written at least two hundred, three hundred years ago. <span class="Italic">Ādhunika,</span> who is care? Who cares for <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>? Technology, hammer..., <span class="Italic">cuta-cut-cuta.</span> Nobody is now interested in philosophy or English literature. The professors say. I have got.... So read the names of the commentator, any chapter. Who are.... Śrīdhara Svāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> (reading Sanskrit names) Śrīdhara Svāmī, and <span class="Italic">Vaṁśidhara-kṛta-bhāvārtha-dīpikā-prakāśa-bhāṣya, Śrī-Gaṅgā-sahaya-praṇītānvika-prakāśaś ca.</span> And <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-vīra-rāghavācārya bhāgavata-candrikā, Śrīmad-vijaya-dhvaja-tīrtha-racita-pada-ratnāvalī, Śrīmaj-jīva-gosvāmī, Krama-Sandarbha, Viśvanātha-cakravartī-kṛta-sārārtha-darśini, Śrīmad-śukadeva-kṛta-siddhānta pathī, Gosvāmī-śrī-giri-hari-lāla-gupta gośāla-prabodhinī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vallabhācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Uh.... <span class="Italic">Śrī-bhagavat-prasādācārya-praṇīta-bhakti-mano-rañjanī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> in their disciplic succession, they have written their comments. Only Śaṅkarācārya has not written. (laughs) He's impersonalist. He could not. Although the present generation of Śaṅkarācārya, they are living by reciting <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and making <span class="Italic">kadarthanā.</span> This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They advocate the <span class="Italic">advaita-tattva</span> in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one Akandananda Swami in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is.... "Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">kṛ</span> means this, <span class="Italic">ṣṇa</span> means this," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Even Rāmānujācārya sampradāya, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is not cited, quoted. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> quotes. (indistinct) Rāmānuja does not quote from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> in <span class="Italic">Śrī-bhāṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānuja, here is Rāmān, Vīra-rāghavācārya is Rāmānuja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is later. I am talking about the great Rāmānujācārya, <span class="Italic">Śrī-bhāṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is accepted. <span class="Italic">Yad vaiṣṇavānāṁ priya.</span> Any Vaiṣṇava, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is, they write comment or not comment. Formerly.... Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not write any.... That does not mean He was not accepting <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> That does not mean. But His disciples wrote, disciplic succession. [break] ...not comment. That does not matter. It is dearmost. Just like in our <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇava</span> there was no comment on the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> Because Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommended.... And in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also, every chapter, <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya.</span> Is that, any chapter? At the end of chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Here it doesn't have. The <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya</span> edition. End of chapter: <span class="Italic">śrī-śrīmad-bhāgavata-mahāpurāṇe paramahaṁsa-saṁhitāyām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paramahaṁsa-saṁhitāyām. Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya</span> is not there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, only Gauḍīya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, it is actually <span class="Italic">bhāṣyāyāṁ brahma-sūtrāṇām.</span> It is stated. This is the real commentary on <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra</span> by Vyāsadeva himself, author. Vyāsadeva is the author of <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra,</span> and he has written personally, under the instruction of his guru, Nārada Muni, this <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya.</span> And it begins with the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra</span> aphorism: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> The <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra</span> begins with these words: <span class="Italic">janmādya, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>. Janmādy asya yataḥ.</span> So these things are explained elaborately. Therefore <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya, bhāṣyāyāṁ brahma-sūtra. Vedārtha paribṛṁhita.</span> So therefore in our Gauḍīya, Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not write any <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> of the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra,</span> neither the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs,</span> because they took it that <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the real <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> of <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra.</span> But when.... Sometimes the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas are challenged that "You cannot be accepted as bona fide community, spiritual community, because you have no <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> on <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra."</span> Then Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa wrote <span class="Italic">govinda-bhāṣya.</span> But Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not like or ask His disciples to write, because He thought, "This is the Gauḍīya, <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra-bhāṣya.</span>" Not Gauḍīya-for every Vaiṣṇava. <span class="Italic">Bhāṣyāyāṁ brahma-sūtrāṇām.</span> So we have got now <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya Vedānta-bhāṣya.</span> <span class="Italic">Rāmānuja Vedānta-bhāṣya</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Madhvācārya Vedānta-bhāṣya</span> is there, all. And Gauḍīya had not. But since this challenge was made in Jaipur, then Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, he took: "Yes," and he finished, <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya bhāṣya,</span> and it is called <span class="Italic">Govinda-bhāṣya.</span> Actually, in India, unless one follows the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> and has given commentary on the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra,</span> he's not a bona fide. <span class="Italic">Nyāya-prasthāna. Brahma-sūtra</span> is called <span class="Italic">nyāya-prasthāna. Śruti-prasthāna, smṛti-prasthāna, nyāya-prasthāna.</span> So any bona fide <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> must give his understanding about these three <span class="Italic">prasthānas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prof. O'Connell:</span> Swamiji, it may be time for us to take your leave. It was a great pleasure and honor to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much for your coming. Now my request is that you take up this movement. It is actually a great contribution to the human society. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭha</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are leaders of the society, if they take it, it is easily understood and easily distributed. So there is no question of sectarian thought. It is the necessity of the human society to understand God. The other day in Detroit, two father priests came to see me. I also requested that we require a set of first-class men that is not there at the present moment. There is no head. They are thinking simply arms wanted, defense, and fight amongst themselves. That's all. Everyone is thinking simply arms wanted. And what they will do with the arms? Fight between themselves, that's all. So one <span class="Italic">asura</span> was given one thousand hands by Lord Śiva. But he could not find any enemy. So he was fighting with hills and mountains and making him smashed. So he came to Lord Śiva: "Sir, you have given me one thousand hands, but there is no enemy for me. I cannot fight." So Śiva said, "Yes, you just wait for the day when your enemy will come who will smash you into pieces." (laughs) So we are simply equipping with arms and finding out to whom we'll fight. That is going on. So everyone is manufacturing the atomic weapons. So there must be some fight, so that all the nations will be ruined. (end)</div>
