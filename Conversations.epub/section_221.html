<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Śyāmasundara is transcribing your talks with me in Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> I received your very kind letter about a week ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Now, you are very intelligent boy. You can try to understand this philosophy. It is very important. And try to preach. For sense gratification people are wasting so much time, but they do not..., they're not responsible what is going to happen next life. But there is next life. Foolish people, they are ignorant, but there is next life, and this life is preparation for next life. That they do not know. The modern education, universities, they're completely in darkness about this simple knowledge. We are changing body every moment-that's a medical science-and after changing this body, we'll have to accept another body. How we are going to accept that body, what kind of body, this can be also known. Just like one is being educated, when he passes his examination, one can understand that he's going to be engineer or a medical practitioner. Similarly, in this life you can prepare yourself to become something next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Can we decide what we want to be in our next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, you can decide. Just like we have decided next life we are going to Kṛṣṇa. This is our decision: back to home, back to Godhead. Just like you become educated, after decision that you are going to be engineer, you are going to be medical practitioner, and in that objective you prepare yourself, educate yourself. Similarly, you can decide what you are going to do next life. If you don't decide, then material nature will decide. Just like a boy who is not nicely educated, without any future objective, the government will decide. If he's a criminal, then government will decide, "Go to jail," and if he's nicely educated, the government will decide, "You take this job." So everything is like that. We have got our future life, and if we don't prepare what is that future life, then we are like animals. The animals, they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Well how can I know if I wasn't Kṛṣṇa conscious in my last life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> If I... How can I know if I wasn't Kṛṣṇa conscious in my last life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Therefore you are given the chance to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Could I have been in my last life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>You may not be. It doesn't matter. But you can become, take advantage of our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> She's asking if it was possible in her last life she was a Kṛṣṇa's devotee, in her last life, and come back again? If you're a Kṛṣṇa's devotee coming back again. In your last...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>When one is perfectly Kṛṣṇa's devotee, he may not come, but if there is little deficiency, then there is possibility of coming back. But even though there is deficiency, he comes back to nice family, <i class="calibre3">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo sañjāyate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 6.41]<i class="calibre3">.</i> (aside:) What is this? Human intelligence can decide for future. That is human intelligence. The animal cannot decide. We have got that discriminating power developed, "I shall do this, I will be benefited. If I do this, I shall not be benefited." This is there in human life. So we have to use it properly. We should know what is our goal of life and decide in that way. That is human intelligence. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> This is a photograph we've received of your Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> Yadubara, I think he has sent many from the family collection of Lalitā Prasāda. The painters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>So keep it and frame it, and keep it in my room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> Should the painters, should they paint such uh, this type of pictures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Why not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> And they can distribute to the centers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Not all family members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> Just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Simply Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> All right. What about this of Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Oh, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, but not that all family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bali-mardana:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Have you ever seen Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> You have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Daily. Every moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> But not in the material..., not in the material body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh? No in... He has no material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Well in the temple here they have pictures of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is not material. You are seeing material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>...because you have got material eyes. Because your, you have got your material eyes, you cannot see the spiritual form. Therefore He kindly appears to be in a material body so that you can see. This is the point. Because He has kindly made Himself just fit for your seeing, that does not mean He is..., that He has material body. Just like President Nixon, if he kindly comes to your house, it does not mean that his position and your position is the same. It is his kindness, out of love, he may come to your house, but that does not mean he is on the same level with you. Similarly, because we cannot see with our present eyes what is Kṛṣṇa, therefore Kṛṣṇa appears before us as painting, as made of stone, as made of wood. And Kṛṣṇa is not different from these paintings and wood because everything is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> After we die, what happens to our spirit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>You get another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. After your, just like you change your apartment, you fix up your apartment first, then you leave this and go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> But we won't, we won't know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> We wouldn't know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes, you'll know it, provided you are qualified; otherwise nature will arrange for it. Those who know, they know what is there, but those who do not know, then nature will arrange. You do not know means you have not prepared your life, so accidentally, at the time of death, your mentality will create another body and nature will supply you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> I'm chanting. What does chanting do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That you can ask these boys. They will instruct you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Could you tell me what is the difference between, uh.... Kṛṣṇa controls everything, so how, how does Kṛṣṇa control a nondevotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>By <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> By having... Just like government controls everything. A criminal is controlled by the police department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> And how does Kṛṣṇa control a devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Just like you control your beloved. Just like you have got a beloved child. So you control him, for his benefit. If he's going to touch fire, you immediately say to him, "No, no, my dear child, don't touch it." So a Kṛṣṇa conscious person, devotee, he is never misled, because Kṛṣṇa is always guiding him, whereas those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they're in charge of <i class="calibre3">māyā,</i> and <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> will do the needful, as you have seen(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Is is preset when we're born, the time that we'll die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Is the time that I'm going to die, and everybody going to die, is this preset before they're born? Do I have, when I'm born, do I have a certain given lifespan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And he cannot change that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>No. He cannot change, but Kṛṣṇa can change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> If he commits suicide, if somebody commits suicide, that is also preset?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. Not preset. That you can do, because you have got little independence. It is not natural to commit suicide. It is unnatural. So, because we have got independence, we can go from nature to unnature, and we shall be prepared for that. Just like a prisoner cannot go out of the prisonhouse naturally, but somehow or other he arranges to jump over the wall and goes away. Then he becomes again criminal, for farther (indistinct). Naturally, the prisoners cannot go out of the prisonhouse. Somehow or other, he manages to go out. That means he becomes again criminal. He will be again arrested, and his term of imprisonment will be increased, or he will be punished more. So naturally we cannot violate the destiny, but if we do it, then we suffer(?). But our destiny can be changed by Kṛṣṇa when we are Kṛṣṇa conscious. That we do not do, but Kṛṣṇa will do. Kṛṣṇa says, <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi:</i> [Bg. 18.66] "I shall give you protection." So that change takes place for my protection by Kṛṣṇa. There are two stages: nondevotee and devotee. The nondevotee is under the control of material nature, and devotee is under the direct control of Kṛṣṇa. Just like a big man. In the office there are many employees, they are controlled by different departmental superintendent. But the small man at home is controlling his children directly. The controller, he is controller both in the office and factory and home, but at home he is controller directly; outside home he is controller indirectly. But he is controller always. Similarly, God is controller always. When one becomes devotee, he is controlled directly by God. When he is nondevotee, he is controlled by His agent, <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> But he has to be controlled. Just like every citizen of America is controlled by the government. When he's all right, his civil department controls him. When he's not all right, then the criminal department controls him. But he cannot say that "I am not controlled." That is not possible. If somebody says, "I am not controlled," he is not sane. He is crazy. Everyone is controlled. So either you be controlled directly by God or you be controlled by his agency. Being controlled by <i class="calibre3">māyā,</i> you spoil your life. That means you remain in the material existence, one after another. You simply change your body. But if you give yourself to be controlled by God, then after this body you go back to home, back to Godhead. Then your life is successful. You cannot be without being controlled. That is not possible. Therefore one who is intelligent, he puts himself under the control of God directly. That is intelligence. And that is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate:<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.19] "After many births of struggling, or speculation, one surrenders unto Me." <i class="calibre3">Vāsudevaḥ sarva...,</i> "Kṛṣṇa, You are everything. So I am.... Accept me. I am now fully surrendered unto You, and You control me." Because I am controlled. So, so long I am being controlled by these rascals, so there is no benefit. I'm controlled. I have been controlled by my senses. So under the control of the senses, I have served family, so-called family, society, country, nation, up to serving the dog, but nothing has given me the satisfaction. Therefore now I have got sense, good sense. I put myself under Your power. Instead of being controlled by dog, let me be controlled by God. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You have not seen, man, how he is controlled by a dog, in the street? The dog stops, passes stool. "Yes, I stand.'' Is it not? He's passing stool, his urine, and the master is thinking, "I am master," but he's being controlled. That is <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> He has become servant of dog, but he is thinking that "I am master of dog.'' This is <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> This is <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> So unless one is Kṛṣṇa conscious, one cannot understand. We can understand that this rascal is being controlled by this dog, but he's thinking that he is the master. We can understand. What do you think? Does he not become controlled by the dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> It's very true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> That, it's very true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>But he's thinking that "I am master of the dog." A family man, he's controlled by his wife, by his children, by his servant, by everyone, but he's thinking, "I am master." President Nixon is thinking that he's master of his country, but he's controlled. At once he can be dismissed by the public, his servant. And he gets that position, placing himself that "I'll give you very good service. I shall be your first-class servant.'' Therefore people vote, "All right, you become president.'' And he's advertising, "Re-elect me. Re-elect me.'' That means he is servant. But he's thinking, "I am master.'' That is the position. <i class="calibre3">Māyā.</i> One who is controlled by <i class="calibre3">māyā,</i> he's thinking himself master, but he's servant. And a devotee, he'll never think himself, "I am master." "I am servant.'' That is the difference between <i class="calibre3">māyā</i> and not <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i> He at least knows that "I am never master. I am always servant." But these rascals, they think that they are master when actually they are servant. That is the difference. That is the difference. When a servant is thinking, "I am master," that is called illusion. And when a servant thinks "I am servant," that is not illusion; that is <i class="calibre3">mukti.</i> That is liberation. Because he is not controlled by a false thought. Try to think about this subject matter. A devotee is never controlled by a false thought. He knows his position. <i class="calibre3">Svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<i class="calibre3">. Mukti,</i> liberation, means to be situated in his own constitutional position. That is called <i class="calibre3">mukti,</i> liberation. I am servant, so if I know that "I am servant," that is my liberation. And I am servant; if I think "I am master," that is his bondage. That is the difference between conditioned life and liberated life. So these Kṛṣṇa conscious devotee, they're always thinking that they are servants of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore all, they are all liberated. They haven't got to endeavor for liberation. They are already liberated, because they are situated in their constitutional position. They're not artificially thinking that "I am master." Otherwise everyone is thinking, "I am master.'' Everyone is thinking. That is illusion. You cannot be master in any stage of your life. You must have to remain servant. That is your position. But when one thinks artificially that he is master, that is his conditioned life. And when one voluntarily surrenders to the supreme master, that is his liberated life. The devotee hasn't got to try for liberation separately. As soon as he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative, he is liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Prabhupāda, people that engage in religions, like these Jesus freaks and other people, they claim that Jesus is guiding them. Can this be so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. But they're not taking the guidance. Just like the Christians. Jesus guiding him, "Thou shalt not kill," but they're killing. Where is the Jesus guidance? Simply by saying, "I am guided by Jesus Christ," will do? "But I don't care for his words." Is that guidance? So nobody is being guided by Jesus Christ. They're falsely claiming. It is very hard to find out a man who is actually being guided by Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ's guidance is open there, but nobody is caring for him. They have taken Jesus Christ as contractor to take up their sins. That is their philosophy. They commit all kinds of sins, and poor Jesus Christ will be responsible. That is their religion. Therefore they say, "We have got very good religion. For all our sinful activities, Jesus Christ will die.'' Very good religion. They have no sympathy for Jesus Christ. "Once he has died for our sins, why should we commit again sins? Such a great life has been sacrificed for our sins.'' <i class="calibre3">That</i> is guided by Jesus Christ. But if you take it otherwise-"We shall go on committing all sins, and Jesus Christ has made contract that he'll nullify all my sins. Simply I go to the church and confess, and come back and again do all nonsense''-do you think it is very goodly intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That you... Actually one is guided by Jesus Christ, he'll get liberation, certainly. But it is very hard to find out a man who is actually being guided by Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> What I think about is the Jesus freaks, the..., these people that, young people that have joined this Jesus movement, and they read the Bible very often, and they try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>But to read the Bible, but violate the Bible injunction, injunction. How they can kill if they are following the Bible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> I asked one. They said..., he said he claimed that Jesus was also eating meat in the Bible. But I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>But that's all right. He, he may eat anything. He's powerful. But he has ordered, "Thou shalt not kill.'' You must stop killing. He is powerful. He can eat the whole world. You cannot compare with Jesus Christ. You cannot imitate Jesus Christ. You shall have to abide by his order. That is your position. Then you are guided by Jesus Christ. That is actually obedience. You cannot imitate. That is explained in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata,</i> that those who are <i class="calibre3">īśvara,</i> those who are empowered, they will do anything, but we cannot imitate. We have to abide by his order. "What he says to me, that I will do.'' You cannot imitate. If you say that "Jesus Christ ate meat,'' admitting that, in what condition he ate meat, if you do not know, then Jesus Christ is contradicting his statement. He's eating himself meat, and he's advising others not to kill. Do you think Jesus Christ is contradicting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>He cannot do that. That, that is real faith in Jesus, that he cannot do that. So "Why he has eaten meat, he knows, but he has asked me not to kill. I have to follow it.'' That is real Christianity. You are not Jesus Christ. You cannot imitate. He has sacrificed his life for God. Can you do that? So why you (indistinct) imitate Jesus Christ? You are imitating Jesus Christ for eating meat. Why not imitate Jesus Christ, sacrifice your life for spreading God consciousness? What do you think, Kīrtanānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. When you preach, you can say all these things with so-called Christians. So what you are doing for God? <i class="calibre3">Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>10.33.29]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Just like sun. The sun is absorbing urine. Can you drink urine? If you want to imitate sun, "Oh, here is sun absorbing urine. Let me drink urine,'' can you? <i class="calibre3">Tejīyasāṁ na doṣāya.</i> He is powerful. He can do everything. Therefore we cannot imitate Him. We have to simply abide by His order. That is real Christian. You cannot imitate powerful man. That is wrong. Just like in our Vedic literature there was a poison ocean. So what.... People became puzzled what to do with this-this demigod. Then Lord Śiva said, "All right. I'll drink it.'' So he drank the whole poison ocean and kept it in his throat, <i class="calibre3">nīlakaṇṭha.</i> Now, you drink poison? Not the ocean. You drink one cup. So how you can imitate Lord Śiva? Lord Śiva never advised that we drink poison. So you have to abide by the advice, not by imitating, "Oh, Lord Śiva...'' Just like this LSD and marijuana, they say sometimes, "Lord Śiva used to smoke <i class="calibre3">gāñjā</i>.'' They say like that. But Lord Śiva drank the whole poison ocean. Can you do that? Lord Śiva's instruction should be taken. He says, "The best worship is to worship Viṣṇu,'' <i class="calibre3">viṣṇu ārādhanaṁ param.</i> When Śiva was asked by Pārvatī that "What method of worship is first-class?'' Then he said, "The first-class worship is worshiping Lord Viṣṇu.'' <i class="calibre3">Viṣṇu ārādhanaṁ param. Tasmāt parataraṁ devi tadīyānām ārādhanam</i>. He said the Viṣṇu worship is the best. There are many demigods, but he recommended, "Viṣṇu worship is the best.'' And the better than Viṣṇu worship is to worship Vaiṣṇava. <i class="calibre3">Tadīyānām ārādhanam. Tadīyā </i>means His servant, or one who is, or what is in relationship with Him. Just like we are worshiping this plant, Tulasī. We are not worshiping all plants, but because this Tulasī has very intimate connection with Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu, therefore we are worshiping. <i class="calibre3">Tadīyānām ārādhanam</i>. Similarly, anything who is intimately related with Kṛṣṇa, worship of that thing is better than worship of Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bob Cohen:</b> Why is that? Worshiping.... ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Because, because Kṛṣṇa will be pleased. Just like if you have a dog, and some friends come and pats your dog, you become pleased. You become pleased, "Ah, he is my good friend.'' We see all (indistinct) come on, that some friend comes and friend's dog, the friend's (indistinct) "My, you have got a nice dog," your friend says. (laughter) Come on. (conversation in Hindi with Indian guests from Bombay for some minutes)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhakti-devī dāsī:</b> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

We don't say that because you are Christian you cannot love God. We simply say that you are not following. If you follow, then you can learn also how to love God. I never said. So many questions are there. "By following Jesus(?), yes, we can attain perfection." Yes?</div>

We say that "You follow Christianity in perfect order, you'll be benefited." That we say. Our test is whether you're advancing in God consciousness. That is our test. You follow Christianity or Muhammadanism, anything you follow, we don't mind. Whether you are developing your God consciousness, love for God, that is our test. But if your process has failed, then you can try this. And you'll see, in our process within so short time, how they are becoming God conscious. You have to admit. And they admit also.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, you are carrying(?) the whole <i class="calibre3">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Me?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Bhakti-rasa...,</i> no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> <i class="calibre3">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, yes. <i class="calibre3">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> No, I had it here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I left it here. I just had a xerox. I left my <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> here, and some other books. I didn't take 'em to India. That <i class="calibre3">Hari-..., hari-nāmāmṛta</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yeah. A few other books I left here. Śrīla Prabhupāda? Well, like, there's an old friend of mine that I had, I called up to come and see you today. He's very nice. At five o'clock. He's going for his Ph.D. in theology at Columbia, and he's also an expert Russian scholar.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> He's been to Russia several times, and uh, it would be very nice...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This, this kind of question and interview is very interesting.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So ordinary men, why these people are..., why you are making this statement when you came, what is the benefit of such a thing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b><i class="calibre3">Jaya</i> Prabhupāda, <i class="calibre3">jaya!</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They do not know...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> So...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, the Russian scholar, he will, theologian, he can describe about God, what is the nature of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>So maybe we can ask him to come at five o'clock...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, that would be nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya</i> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> And also some of our men, like Prajāpati is an M.A. in theology, and Ravindra-svarūpa M.A. in philosophy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> And they will be here too, and it will be nice to hear discussion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's right. That discussion only. Students of philosophy, theology, what is their idea of God, what they are thinking, what is their defect, we can talk. Ordinary men you can (indistinct) try to avoid. If they want some question, you can ask.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes. <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I am one of the teachers in the <i class="calibre3">gurukula</i>...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ahh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> ...and one of the boys, Ekendra, his mother, Kalindi, she wants to take him away from the school.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> She wants to take him away from the school. So she's leaving it up to you, to your decision, as to whether the boy goes with her or stays in the <i class="calibre3">gurukula</i> school. He's progressing very nicely at <i class="calibre3">gurukula</i>. The school is just starting. He's very intelligent boy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So why he is taking? Why she is taking?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Kalindi wants..., likes to take Ekendra.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> She's very attached.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Attached.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. So she's mother. If she wants to take, what can you do? She doesn't like her son to be Kṛṣṇa conscious, what you can do? Where she is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> She's here, actually. She is serving Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> She is serving, but she is not sure if that would be the best thing. She's attached, maybe...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So you convince her that ordinary schools, going, there are so many ordinary schools and students, where the students are coming out useless hippies. Do you like to have your son to become hip..., which are hippies? Ask on this point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya</i> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Because we practically see, all the college students are hippies. Irresponsible vagabonds. If she wants her son to become like that, that is different thing. Irresponsible vagabonds, that is the present status of this country. The majority of the students, they are becoming irresponsible vagabonds. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, correct. We all have experience in that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, if she, if she wants son to become irresponsible, irresponsible vagabond, in the association... Of course, our Dallas also we should take very much care so that we may not also produce irresponsible vagabond. So don't cause irresponsible vagabonds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what are your instructions to the parent..., to the teachers as to how they treat parents? I have heard several parents sometimes complain that..., that they don't get enough news about their children from the teachers. Should teacher let the parents know about the children?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So our, the small children teaching...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...means they should learn alphabet.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How to read and write. That is the first thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And balance they should learn how to become Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya!</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And we let the parents know how the children is progressing? Do we have responsibility to parents, to let them know, inform them about the progress of children?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, we have no time for such talk. If he, he or she can come and see. We have no such. That is ordinary school.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> J<i class="calibre3">aya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Our progress is how the student is becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is our point. And because he has to read nicely, he has to speak nicely, he must be literate, not illiterate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> To read your books?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So that by reading the books they will have immense knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> This generation...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This much we want.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...are very fortunate, Prabhupāda. They're very fortunate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> They fight a lot, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> They fight a lot.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That children should fight, but if you give them, give them good arrangement, more engagement for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, always engage them in chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> They should do as much <i class="calibre3">japa</i> as possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. They should have no scope, simply chant and dance, daily engagement, and (indistinct) says that they should play Kṛṣṇa play-cowherds boy going to the forest, someone, someone has become cow, like that. If they have got good engagement, and sometimes they fight, after all, they're coming from fighting father and mother. So you have to change them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The father and mother, they're also fighting (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what is their fault?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> We have a lot of plays that they could fight in the play.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Kṛṣṇa playing, fighting the demons.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then they are Kṛṣṇa conscious. Somehow or other, this is the goal. In fighting also there is Kṛṣṇa. Somebody may become a demon, Kṛṣṇa is fighting, carrying Him away. These are described in the <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa</i> book.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> I noticed that, that everything is in there, even blind man's bluff, and hide and seek. These things originated in the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> That everything is in the <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa</i> book to engage the children.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Children here play hide and seek, which is also..., the <i class="calibre3">gopīs</i> play.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> Cowherd boys.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Cowherd boys play the game.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, also in  India. That is a popular play for children. We..., we played. It gives great pleasure, that "I have hidden; my friend cannot see me." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if she decides to leave her child at the school, what are the instructions to her? She should not write him, or she should come... How often can she come to visit him?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> As many times as she likes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> She may come daily, or she can remain there to see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (5):</b> Oh. <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Can I ask a question?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> He's another teacher.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Can I ask you a question?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> That many, many devotees have, have since I have arrived here, have asked me questions about how, how to treat the children, how to, how to teach the children, and they have, you know, there are many children in other temples besides <i class="calibre3">gurukula</i> who are either are not, not of age yet, or who have not been sent yet...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Everyone is of age. That is all right. It is not that there is no age limit. Anyone who can remain, that is the best thing. But with very small children, I think nowadays after three years children can begin.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> After three? After three? <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i> They, they've asked us many questions. Should..., is there any, is there any information? How should we, should we send information from <i class="calibre3">gurukula</i> to the other temples?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Who? Who asked questions?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Devotees who have children, who have come to the temple. They said, one woman said that "They've..., my son, they're throwing him in cold shower. They say he has to take a cold shower, and that no one wants to have anything to do with him because he's so much trouble..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, we have got our own program. We cannot accept the different program, that "My son should be done like this..." We should see that everyone is taking bath daily, that's all. They are taking bath daily?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's nice. Rising early in the morning?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Attending <i class="calibre3">maṅgala ārati</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Yes</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Chanting? Dancing? These are our programs. Class, little a-b-c-d, no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> But no force, yes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> They, they... She was questioning me about force, that there should... I told her that, that your instruction to us was that no...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Force?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> ...there should not be force ever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Hitting, hitting the children.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Or forcing them to do activities. That no..., that should not be done.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Forcing the children to do the activities.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> To use force. Hitting them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (6):</b> Or hitting them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not hitting. By otherwise engage.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Like if he doesn't...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> "Don't you see your other friends are taking bath. Why shall you not take bath? Very nice, you are so intelligent boy, you are not like that."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Positive.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> By sweet words. They are after all children. Forcing is not good. (pause) What it this?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Oh, I just wrote... My brother was in the hospital, so I just wrote a little letter to him. I'm going to send him some...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is the letterheading, latest?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yes, this is New York society. I don't have any envelopes, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This printing in our press?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I don't know. This is the first I've seen of it, just now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>Would you like some, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I'm sending over some <i class="calibre3">tulasī</i> leaves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Little <i class="calibre3">tulasī</i> leaf?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Eat? No, shouldn't send.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He's not a devotee. He'll "Oh, what is this?" Throw away.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like the <i class="calibre3">tulasī</i> plant is here, somebody will think that it is decoration. We put it here, devotion, but those who are not interested to speak them about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we offense. One of the ten offenses.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yeah. I was wondering about that. I didn't know whether to do it or not.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They should be asked ordinary question: What is the life? What is the aim of life?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is consciousness? Philosophy, which is understandable by everyone (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Would you like something Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I want to (indistinct) my head.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where is Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> He's in his office I think. He was there just a minute ago. I'll just write him the chant or something.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I'll just write him the chant maybe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, chant also is not correct.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4): </b>Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> He's coming, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7):</b> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Would you like to see them? (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> ... do it effectively. And, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Muralīdhara just asked you that when Lord Brahmā, when he became angry at the four Kumāras he created Lord Śiva from between his eyebrows. So he is always situated on his lotus, but at that time should we paint him on his planet?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> His planet is just like lotus flower.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like Kṛṣṇa planet is also like lotus.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> <i class="calibre3">Jaya,</i> so, so it has...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like here in this material world the Brahmā's planet is the ultimate. That is also like mat..., lotus flower, and in the spiritual world the ultimate planet is Kṛṣṇa-loka.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> So you would have palaces and garden scenes and Lord Brahmā perhaps on his throne?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. <i class="calibre3">Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bs. 5.29]. There are palaces, trees, everything. They are not voids. The voidist cannot understand what is there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7):</b> And Śrīla Prabhupāda, can we paint more informal portraits...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (7):</b> ...of yourself and the other <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i> to send to the temples? Or should we...</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> Informal. That is, Puṣkara painted a picture of you sitting in a very formal position.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah ha...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> Should we stick to formal positions, or is it all right to do informal pose, like just your head and your chest?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Formal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> Formal always?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Always. Not like bust, no. Just like <i class="calibre3">guru mahārāja</i>. We won't put all that top, bust form.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yadurāṇī:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda? You asked for big, big, paintings to be sent to Māyāpur and Vṛndāvana. When you say "big, big," do you mean like five feet and..., or six feet? That big?</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (9):</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda? You said you want to present more philosophy in <i class="calibre3">Back to Godhead</i> magazine. Does that mean that we should make it more and more sophisticated? Or does that mean that we should try to present the philosophy in the easiest way?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You should insert articles. It is reality. It is not speculation. Nothing, our activity, is speculation or imaginary. Everything is fact. We should present in that way. Either picture or philosophy, anything. They are all facts. People may not take it as something imagination. That argument will be there. Just like here there is a picture, Dakṣa is with a goat head. But they may not take it as imagination. That is possible. It is fact.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Why? We had limited opportunity for associating, so offensively. You'll be leaving today.</div>
