<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...position. It is not a good position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, it's not very clear. I was just wondering who the other two were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> has to be taken from a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>, so I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, I was wondering what his name was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, his name is Keśava Mahārāja. He's one of the Godbrothers. He's also one of my Godbrothers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And he took it the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are now dead and gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. This man, he looks very old already. The other one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. He was... He is of my age, middle. The other one, he was older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Harikeśa said the day before you took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> you were gored by a cow or something? A cow hit you in the stomach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The day before you took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was told that. I don't know whether it was... Or some time around then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was long before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, that was a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> sometime in '59, and... No, that is after I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>. No, no. Before, yes. Before or after,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He said it was the day before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That was an incident in Delhi. Now I think it was... It was before. Before. That was sometime in 1956.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, that's a long time before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> in 1959.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was in Vṛndāvana or Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Delhi. <span class="Italic">Vānaprastha</span>. I was alone. But my paper was going on, <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> In Delhi I was alone. I was doing everything. Editing, selling, collecting, cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was no Godbrothers helping at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not take. They wanted. I did not like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Did you ever think at that time that you would be able to expand or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was trying to do. It was a struggle at that time. At that time, I lived with some of my Godbrothers, but I did not like, and I left their temple, and I was living alone. Then in Imlitala you know here? Imlitala, Seva-kunj there is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, I'm not familiar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My Godbrother's temple. He had a temple in Delhi, Karol Bagh. I left Jhansi and came to Mathurā. I lived there for few months. Then I went to Delhi. In this way, here, there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The boy at the front, he's reading one of your old <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams.</span> He has one of your original <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams.</span> The boy at the front that's on guard. Akṣaya, the boy that guards. He's been reading one of your original <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams,</span> the 1.1.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And I was looking at the front and it gives your residence in Vṛndāvana at Rādhā-Dāmodara and your office in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was not unpleasant. When I was living alone, doing everything, it was not unpleasant. I was... Very nice. That was an accident. Otherwise, it was not unpleasant. Alone everything I was doing. Rather, I had not so much anxiety for management. Even my, this son came to live with me. I said, "No, you don't."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who was that? Vṛndāvana there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. They sent, my family, to go and live with me. He came twice, thrice. The reason is that I asked him "If you want to live with me then you have to live with me as <span class="Italic">sannyāsī, brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And he couldn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise... From 1954, '55. Up to '54... 1950, I left home 1950. From '50 to '54 I lived in Jhansi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was when you started the League of Devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. At that time there were many students. They were not my disciples, but they were coming. Like... that Prabhākāra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, Prabhākāra Ācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was the head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) You were teaching Vaiṣṇavism or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I wanted to start from there. It was very nice, big house. But this K. Munshi's wife tactfully wanted me to... The Governor's wife. That was a very big house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, there were some politics. I didn't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he peacefully took it. I could have fought but I did not like. All the pleaders in Jhansi, they said, "Don't leave." She was pressing through the collectors, to the manager. That house belonged to some <span class="Italic">zamindar.</span> But it was under the management of another man, Reba Shankara(?). So he was proprietor of one cinema hall. So the governor's wife was pressing him through the collector because the license has to be renewed from the collector. Collector was insisting that "You give that house, Lilavati Munshi. Indirectly. Otherwise, your license will not be issued."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They didn't leave you very much choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought, I could not do something tangible. That's a fact. (indistinct) Somehow or other, I thought, let me go to Vṛndāvana. What is the use of fighting? Otherwise, all the big lawyers in Jhansi, they were my friends. They said that "You not go. We shall arrange." I thought that "I have left my home, for this reason I am going to, again litigation. I don't want this house. Let her do something."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The League of Devotees, was that Godbrothers again? Was that some Godbrothers that you joined up with or was that just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, after leaving Jhansi I went to this Godbrother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Keśava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I lived there for few months. Then I went to another Godbrother, that Imlitala, Delhi. Then I left there. I used to live alone in Delhi. Then I took one house in Keśī-ghāṭa. Then the Rādhā-Dāmodara men they called me that "You can live here. We give you two rooms. We don't charge. We give you the place." I came to Rādhā-Dāmodara. And from Rādhā-Dāmodara temple I went U.S.A.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was just wondering what exactly the League of Devotees was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, League was that, that was... I was trying to collect some devotees. Some of them, they were medical... Yes. Medical students. So they came and used to live with me. But still, I lived there for two years. From 1954 to '56. I had some surgical operation in my testicles there. They were taking care. This Prabhākāra and... They were not full time. They were students. That's all. They were living with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams,</span> it says they were published by the League of Devotees. Does that just mean yourself or there were others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That was... League of Devotees was my organization. Therefore I gave that name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But actually it was just you. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That League of Devotees, I was alone doing. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was trying to understand who it could be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am everything at that time. There were some students, but they were not any active. I was doing everything. That League of Devotees means I am everything. I wanted to organize with this Prabhākāra Miśra and others. But they were not interested to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not to become Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, to devote whole time. They were... Just like Prabhākāra comes still. But if you ask him to do full time work, that he'll not do. Therefore I did not initiate others. He was initiated, Haridāsa. But they were all learned scholars, Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Do any of them come now? Do any of them come now apart from Prabhākāra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? No, they are, they have gone in the... They are practicing as medical men. They were students, medical students. Now they are practicing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't come to see you or anything now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometime they came. Long time it is passed. That was in 1956 or '55. No, '54.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Jhansi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, twenty years past. More than twenty years. You can speak of twenty years history. What is that? (end)</div>
