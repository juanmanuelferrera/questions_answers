<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has taken your Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vīrabhadra:</span> Who has taken Him? I don't know. Somebody, they broke in the house, they took one typewriter and the sewing machine and I think it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Typewriter? When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last night. Yesterday we just got a new sewing machine. A very expensive sewing machine and they stole it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sewing machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And a typewriter. It was taken from the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> While we were at Griffith Park with <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party they broke into our house and took it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that quarter is not nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's not a nice quarter. So we'll take more precautions now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody must remain always. That is the only precaution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> O.K. Yes, that's what I was thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in our apartment also somebody must remain. Here this is... In New York also I lost my typewriter, tape recorder. In 72nd St. at daytime, at nine o'clock. I went to take my meals in Dr. Miṣra's place at about nine, and when I came back I saw the door is broken. That superintendent, he was a Negro. He has done, I know that. This is very common case here. You purchased new machine and new...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The tape recorder... I mean the sewing machine was Śīlavatī's. She has sent it down here with Dinesh. Two or three hours before I had just gotten it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your tape recorder also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dineśa:</span> No. I had brought the sewing machine from Śīlavatī in San Francisco. Yes. This sewing machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And typewriter, whose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The typewriter was mine. I'd just... Puruṣottama had just brought it from New York from my parents to me. So less than a week and they both are gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New typewriter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it was practically new. It was a very good typewriter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the maker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Olivetti. It's the portable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Olivetti portable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. A good one. But the sewing machine is very expensive. It may be 150 dollars. 163 dollars. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to take care. What can be done? Now you should be very careful, and somebody must remain there always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Govinda:</span> We live in a very good quarter though. They live by Watts and that's the... They live by Watts district, and Watts district is very notorious. There were seven-day riots of shooting and Negro revolts there about two years ago, three years ago. We live in a very nice quarter, but where they're living is in a very bad place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you will continue to live there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's in La Palma. It's not directly in the worst area. It's not in Watts county. It's in a different area, but still... Where you live is very good though. I don't think there would be any theft. More safe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It appears very respectable quarter. All right. Read. (end)</div>
