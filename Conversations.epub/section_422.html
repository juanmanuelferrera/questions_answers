<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...even those who are farmers (indistinct). In India also. As soon as they get some education, they don't want to be a farmer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>They're going to the cities.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>Yes. They will be satisfied to become a petty clerk and get some very little income. They will be satisfied. They don't want to be <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i>. That is the real <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i>. They are satisfied simply by eating, that's all. No ambition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa: </b>So somehow or other we have to attract some <i class="calibre3">śūdras</i> to our movement if we want to work self-sufficiently.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So for the time being, what is to be done? We shall take it, then we shall see, find out <i class="calibre3">śūdra, </i>(indistinct) better price. But we will require more land.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> We will require a self-sufficient... Not only land, but we require a self-sufficient community.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Because of Kali-yuga. And also everyone in Vṛndāvana that I mention that we are planning to have <i class="calibre3">gośala</i>, everyone likes the idea. That will be very popular here.<i class="calibre3"> Gośala,</i> everyone, their eyes become bright.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Make at least <i class="calibre3">gośala,</i> keep cows. That is also profitable.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Yes, maybe we should do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> One or two men may simply take care of the cows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Maybe we should do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And grow grass, let them pasture.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Yes, and plant trees.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Maybe we should do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway, we have to utilize the land; otherwise what is the use?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Of course.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Suppose we invest one lakh of rupees. One lakh rupees means 10,000 rupees per annum, almost 800, 900 rupees per month in interest. So we must utilize it. From this monetary point of view, because they get bank interest, people are not very interested in land.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> But you can't eat money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> You can't eat money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ultimately that is the... (break) ...somehow or other, but it must be properly utilized. Who will give me massage?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Oh, Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So ask him. (break) ...money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> My point of..., you can't eat money means that if it is in the bank earning interest...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> My point was if it is in the bank earning interest, we may die at any moment, so what is the point of in the bank? But if we have some land and utilizing it, it is a better investment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First you purchase, then we shall make program. For the time being, purchase. Actually that is money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> When you sow it, it will bring more money. There will be no problem.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> In the old system, land and jewelry was riches.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Jewelry for rich man, land for ordinary man. Land and food grains, that is money. So at our present status, how we can utilize this land? As grazing ground?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Presently I think <i class="calibre3">gośala </i>is more practical.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There is another <i class="calibre3">gośala,</i> they are not utilizing, Panchar(?) Gośala. Why don't you try for that? They can give it free, that we shall... "Give us it, we shall utilize it for Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> We can try.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Find out who is Panchar(?). "If we do not use for <i class="calibre3">gośala,</i> then you can take it back. But we shall utilize it for <i class="calibre3">gośala</i>. So why don't you give us the land?" Attached to the temple, we maintain a <i class="calibre3">gośala.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Still we shall require to grow some food for the cows and nice water supply. Then you simply keep the cows there. They will eat and drink and remain here peacefully. Only one room for watching(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> (indistinct), he was complaining when I have last time... (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> I think he had given him the books for distribution. He is distributing them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But he was to give one house and so many things, then he was to distribute them, whatever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi) (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> ...make sure they come back again.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (speaks in Hindi with Indian)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Also in Vṛndāvana we are here to stay, no matter what the people say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi conversation for several minutes)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> <i class="calibre3">Accha.</i> He is not a (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> He is not a (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You do not know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> No, I don't know. I think he is a graduate. Huh? He's not even a graduate? (Prabhupāda chuckles) I was told that he was a graduate long ago, you see, when I used to go to Calcutta, the Gauḍīya Maṭh there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> And Bon Mahārāja also has told he is a graduate. What is he?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is he?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> Bon Mahārāja, graduate? He is Karachi (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, I don't think so. Anyway, so (Hindi). Bon Mahārāja is a (Hindi), very important.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Accha.</i> (Hindi) (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Before I came, we had one big festival in Geneva for two days, Saturday and Sunday. Each night over 500 people. It was nice. Geneva's not very big.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Geneva is important town.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Important, not very big though.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> International town.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> When I was going to London from Bombay..., no, no, when I was going to Switzerland, I think I stopped at Geneva.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Zurich. You were in Zurich.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Zurich, before that I stopped at Geneva. I saw the airport, very big airport. Then I went to Zurich. And from Zurich I went to some Mount St....</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> St. Hellish.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have been there? You are right, St. Hellish. (unclear)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> (laughs) Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Śyāmasundara, "Oh, I have to..." He spent money for that. I thought "It is hellish." (laughter) Always covered with snow, I could not get out. Two days I was imprisoned in that hotel room. But people go there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> For health.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> For their health.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is the health there? But one wonderful I saw from there. Down 10,000 feet, (indistinct) hill.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> Mountain.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Mountain, yes. Down I saw the railway is going on... (break) ...has entered the sky. That is (indistinct). That is (indistinct). And the railway is very nice. Not like Darjeeling.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> You have to leave just now?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. I was to leave this morning, but I was to eat Yamunā's cooking. Cooking was very nice, but I had no appetite.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Appetite. No appetite.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> From yesterday lost my appetite.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> Because I was massaging you from yesterday.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (chuckles) No, that's not. It is Kṛṣṇa's grace to have less appetite, I think. Less sleep, less appetite, it is good. <i class="calibre3">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau <span class="Italic"></span></i>**<i class="calibre3">.</i> They conquered over, but I have not conquered it. By Kṛṣṇa's grace, it is reduced.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> May I have the key to the almirah, put these books away?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. You have got the duplicate key? So I can take this key?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Yes, I've given it to Guṇārṇava just now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> I've given it to Guṇārṇava this morning, the duplicate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> So I will not live in this place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> I will not live in your house, but I will work here. Because there is some objection from the boys, a lady living here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (speaks Hindi with Indian man)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> So he doesn't have any first hand in publishing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi) All the <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i>, all Rādhā-Ramaṇa <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> No, not all Rādhā-Ramaṇa <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i>. The Rādhā-Ramaṇa <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i> are represented by...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> They were represented by (indistinct) Gosvāmī and (indistinct) Gosvāmī, but the <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i> of the other temples.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Rādhā-Dāmodara's were there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> Rādhā-Dāmodara was there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Yesterday Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī was little bit rude, yesterday.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b><i class="calibre3"> Accha?</i> To you?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> He was angry because he had locked the door and locked me outside, and I knocked on the door until he came, and he was angry. He was a little rude. So I could tell something was wrong.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Because usually he is not so rude.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Usually he is not rude.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> He is never harsh. He was a little harsh. I could tell something was wrong.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So they are planning something.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> I don't know exactly. I've not been able to make out what their plans are exactly because they don't tell me everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> They don't tell me everything. They have something up their sleeves. I don't know what.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> So what should be our...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī, other time he was not harsh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Not to me. To Gurudāsa maybe, but never me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But this time he was harsh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Yes, very harsh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> He was yelling.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> He was yelling, raising his voice. He wasn't speaking in a quiet tone, he was yelling at me, "Why you are disturbing my <i class="calibre3">sevā-pūjā</i> by making me come to the door?" I said, "I am engaged in Vaiṣṇava <i class="calibre3">sevā</i> as well. Vaiṣṇava<i class="calibre3"> sevā</i> and Kṛṣṇa<i class="calibre3"> sevā</i>. You please excuse me." I was very courteous, but he was harsh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So he was on the door?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Madana-Mohana temple door?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā: </b>Yes, putting the wooden bolt so I can't come inside. Yesterday this was. After leaving here for <i class="calibre3">pravacana</i> and going there, he had locked the gate. Then I knocked until he came.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī or Rādhā-Ramaṇa?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> No, Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what business you have to go to Madana-Mohana temple at that time?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī of Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ohhhh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Gaurachand's other side, where we live.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah, Madana-Mohana Gosvāmī. I thought from Madana-Mohana temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Well, what about this Gaurachand Gosvāmī?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> He is calling for Gurudāsa sometimes. We don't speak so much. I don't see him because he isn't doing worship for the Deity of Dāmodara any more. So he is quiet, stays in the background. I think he wants sometimes a little money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> I think he is having a little difficulty with money, so he asks sometimes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Some help?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Sometimes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Does he?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Not very often; sometimes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yamunā:</b> Otherwise we don't see so much. But now I find he moved from Dāmodara.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> The last time I saw him, he said he wants Panchu to work for us. He said he...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what he will work? What he will work?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> He says he will do anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anything, but what anything? What?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Right now we have no work except construction. So what should I tell him when I see him?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>What about?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> If he asks what about Panchu working there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what kind of work you can provide? Is there any work for him?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Only now construction.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The construction, what he will do? He has no experience. Now see this gosvāmī, worshiping Deity, now he has no worshiping job: "Give me construction work."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> When we start our Deity program, should we...?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> No pay?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No pay, neither... He smokes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> Suppose he will join us and shave head and give up <i class="calibre3">bidis,</i> then he can...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That will take six life. (laughter) <i class="calibre3">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.19]<i class="calibre3">.</i> It is not so easy. It is not so easy. To give up all these things, it is only by Kṛṣṇa's grace. But they are not meant for that. But for money's sake, business sake, they can take any shape. That is another thing. At least they will not be able to give up <i class="calibre3">bidis</i>. That is not possible. They may be <i class="calibre3">gosvāmī</i> for everything, not for <i class="calibre3">bidi.</i> (speaks Hindi with Indian man briefly)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> So Prabhupāda, I have an engagement at 4:30. I came only to see you because Nirvasi told me that you were leaving.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct) (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> So is there any instructions about this <i class="calibre3">gosvāmī </i>business that you have?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Gosvāmī</i> business? What <i class="calibre3">gosvāmī</i> business?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Gurudāsa:</b> These <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i> of Vṛndāvana, that are agitated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, I have not received any letter from them. Unless we receive a letter, how we can say anything?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man:</b> I have told Purushottam(?) Gosvāmī...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> I have told Purushottam(?) Gosvāmī and the other <i class="calibre3">gosvāmīs</i> also that Prabhupāda is in a very conciliatory mood, and if you make a proper approach, he is prepared to make proper amends for whatever has been taken in (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2): </b>But the approach should be proper.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> The approach should be proper.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. You told him?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2)</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> I told him about the drafts, you see, that you made the other day. I said, "Prabhupāda has only agreed. It was so magnanimous of him, so magnanimous."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I told you Friday, you write, I shall sign it. And why they are agitating and stopped such a function? And that is very regrettable. <i class="calibre3">Gosvāmī</i> means <i class="calibre3">vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegaṁ viṣaheta.</i> If there is some <i class="calibre3">krodha,</i> you should tolerate. Now here is a Vaiṣṇava, he has done so much for Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the reception was there, and he stopped. How he is <i class="calibre3">gosvāmī</i>? He expressed his <i class="calibre3">krodha</i> in that very moment, just to take retaliation. It is not gosvāmī. What do you think? <i class="calibre3">Krodha-vegam.</i> It is a <i class="calibre3">krodha,</i> but he could not tolerate that <i class="calibre3">krodha-vegam.</i> He retaliated at the right moment and to a person, fit person who was to be honored. Just see. And he claims to be gosvāmī. The first business is <i class="calibre3">vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegam.</i> The Vaikuṇṭha mentality is that if one is serving-I have read it in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata-</i>Kṛṣṇa better than somebody else, he would simply appreciate that "Kṛṣṇa has so much favored him. Oh, how fortunate he is. When I shall be able?" That is Vaikuṇṭha mentality. And the material mentality is, "Oh, he has advanced so much. How to come down him?" That is material. This is the difference between Vaikuṇṭha mentality. So his business is how to come down. So he is not a <i class="calibre3">gosvāmī</i>. At least I will not accept. What do you think? Am I right or wrong?</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Indian man (2):</b> What shall I say? (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is the definition of<i class="calibre3"> gosvāmī.</i> <i class="calibre3">Vāco vegam krodha-vegam udaro-vegam pastha-vegam etān manasaḥ vegam, etān vegān viṣaheta dhīraḥ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt.</i> So he has not proved to be very <i class="calibre3">dhīra.</i> <i class="calibre3">Dhīrādhīra-priyau priya-karau nirmatsarau. </i>So that is my regret, that these people cannot appreciate the service of a Vaiṣṇava. They are simply personally interested. Personally interested is materialistic way of life. Everybody is personally interested.</div>
