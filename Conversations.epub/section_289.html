<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (agrees in French)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the process of enlightening the living entities, especially the human being, because in the animal form of life, one cannot be enlightened. Neither the animal can understand what is God.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is only the human being who can understand. If he's trained, then he can come to God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, yes, yes, It is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this creation is meant for the forgotten souls to give them a chance for reviving their God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, it is clear. It is very, very clear. Very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And for this business, sometimes God personally comes. Sometimes He sends His representative, His son, or His devotee, His servant. This is going on. God wants that these forgotten souls should come back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore from His side, that is constant endeavor to revive their God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now this God consciousness can be awakened in the human form of life, not in other form of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Not in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe very rarely, but the human being... (aside:) Where is the water?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> The human being has got the prerogative to awaken his dormant God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the best service to humanity is to awaken their God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, it is true, it is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is the necessity of internal conversion, yes, for human, human souls to return to God. But do you think that this, the personality of human soul is a personality permanent? That is, we remain always distinct, not separate from God, but distinct of God?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But still we find that the French young people today are at the head of all the revolutionary philosophies and movements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. Yes. But it is not the majority of the young men and this revolutionary spirit is amongst many youths, some research, research of the Absolute. Some young men are communist and Marxist, surely. But many youths, today have a spirit of research factually. In, insatisfied with actual religious forms, but receives any religious experience, a spiritual experience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the latest thing. They are now disgusted with these religious rituals without philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui, oui,</span> it is so, it is so. They have accepted some formalism, ritualism. They do not like this. But receives a personal and internal experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> But you have a great interest in France amongst (about) the yoga, monk, Indian method of prayer, a great interest. And we, we think that the method of prayer are the same in the various religions. We have in Christian faith method of meditation of interior, <span class="Italic">interiorite,</span> of silence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What is the, what is the program that Christianity has for giving people in general this experience that they're missing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui. Bien. Cest, nous avons...</span> We have today many community of prayers where young men go together and in the monastery or in the... <span class="Italic">N'est ce pas?</span> And pray together with alternative of silence and of lectures, of some text of the Bible and of the gospel, you know. Because we, we think that the life of Jesus is the model or the shape, and we like that Jesus is the manifestation of God. He is the way, the way. Because it is necessary to find God, who is hidden, to have a way, to have a way. And for ourself, Jesus is the way to go to the hidden God. You know, you know. The imitation of Jesus is, for a Christian, the ideal, imitation of his poverty, of his goodness, of his love of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says the ideal of Christianity is to imitate these various qualities of Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. I think it is the character specific of Christianity, the importance of the person of Jesus. Jesus is the perfect model, you know, of the virtues, and it is apply the model on the savior because we think that Jesus is not purely man. He is a manifestation of God. God is gone amongst us to help the man to find Him. We know that the man research God, but his capacity of find, and is necessary that God come to help the man to find Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We call that guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. And Jesus, Jesus is this. So I am very, very glad to meet you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May, may I ask you one question? Jesus says: "Thou shalt not kill." So why Christian people are killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is forbidden in Christianity to kill. Surely. But chiefly we think that there is a difference between the life of man and the life the beasts. <span class="Italic">N'est ce pas?</span> And that the life of man is sacred because man is the image of God. But we have not the same respect relating to the beasts, to the animals, and we think that the animals are at the service of man, and that it is <span class="Italic">legitime</span> to man. For us, each life is not the same. What is really important is the life of man, and the human person is really sacred and it is forbidden to kill a human person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but Jesus does not says "human being". He just said generally: "Thou shalt not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French) In the Bible we have many example of, by example, we have many sacrifice in the sacrifice of animals. You know. Many sacrifice of animals in the Bible. <span class="Italic">Alors.</span> This is not forbidden. It is sure that it is a great sin to kill a man, <span class="Italic">alors.</span> There is surely the great question of the war, the war, the national war. And is, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you, you think that to kill an animal is no sin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> No, no, no. No sin. No sin. No sin. Because we think that the simple biologic life is not sacred. That is, what is sacred is the human life, the human life. But not the life, ass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I think that it is interpretation. Jesus Christ says generally: "Thou shalt not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. Jesus said, but this phrase is not, the text is not a text of Jesus. It is a text of the <span class="Italic">Old Testament,</span> and it is a text...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is <span class="Italic">New Testament</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Old Testament! Old Testament.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, is it not in the <span class="Italic">New Testament?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is in the <span class="Italic">Levitic,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Levitic,</span> in the book of the <span class="Italic">Levitic.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahhh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is not a word of Jesus. It is a word of the <span class="Italic">Levitic,</span> and it is a part of the decalogue of the Ten Commandments what God gave to Moses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But Ten Commandments, one of the Commandments is that: "Thou shalt no kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French) <span class="Italic">Mais,</span> it is surely, I think, it is surely the killing of the man. I think, I have a great difficulty to understand why in Indian religion... Because it is impossible... By example, it is necessary, <span class="Italic">pour la nourriture?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> For food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui.</span> For the food of man to eat, to eat, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man can eat grains, food grains, fruits, milk, sugar, wheat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Not, not, (French)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No flesh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> No flesh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why? Just like the fruits. The fruits are meant for human being. The tiger does not come to eat your fruits. So tiger's food is another animal. Man's food is fruit, food grains, milk products. Just like fruit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes. I understand. It is why because grain and plants are also living beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Living beings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that we also understand. But if, if you cannot live... Just like, generally, if I can live on fruits and grains and milk, why should I kill another animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another thing is that how can you support that animal killing is not sin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> How do you justify it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, because we, we thought that there is a difference of nature between life of man, life of spirit, and biological, biological life. And we say... [break] ...not really exists, and we think so. We think that animals, plant are not real beings, are world of appearance and that you human person only is real being. And that in this sense, the material world is without importance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now..., I follow. Suppose you are living in this house. So you are not this house, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if I come and break your house, is it not inconvenience for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, surely. Surely it is inconvenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if I cause inconvenience unto you, is it not criminal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is inconvenient to me, but is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If I cause some inconvenience to you, is it not criminal? Is it not sinful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> I think if there is a serious reason, it is not the destruction of the spiritual man itself. By example, it is perfectly possible to use of the reality of the material world, of the natural world to the valuable finality of human vocation. We think that the question is a question of motivation. It could exist bad reason to kill an animal. But if the killing of animal is to give food to children, men, women, we <span class="Italic">ont faim. Qui...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hungry.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Can you understand?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātma-mātā guroḥ patnī brāhmaṇī,</span> the wife of the priest.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four. <span class="Italic">Ātma-mātā guroḥ patnī brāhmaṇī rāja-patnikā, dhenur. Dhenu</span> means cow. <span class="Italic">Dhenur dhātrī. Dhātrī</span> means nurse. <span class="Italic">Tathā pṛthvī. Pṛthvī</span> means earth. These are seven mothers. So cow is mother because we drink milk, cow's milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I deny that she's not mother? So how we can support killing of mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, it is a motive. But we think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, in India, those who are meat-eaters, they are advised... That is also under restriction. Advised to kill some lower animals like goats, even up to buffaloes. But cow killing is the greatest sin.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because the cow is mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you take the milk from the mother...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when she's old, she cannot give you milk, therefore she should be killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that very good proposal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui, oui, oui.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says yes, it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says: "Yes, it is a good proposition."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> If, if the men are hungry, it is the life of men is more important than the life of cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, because we are propagating this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we ask people to, not to eat meat, any kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if, under certain circumstances, you are obliged to eat meat, eat the flesh of some lower animals. Don't kill cows. It is the greatest sin. And so long one will be sinful, he'll not be able to understand what is God. But human being, main business is to understand God and to love Him. But if he remains sinful, neither he can understand God, and what to, what is the question of loving Him. Therefore at least from the human society, this cruel maintenance of slaughterhouses must be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui, oui.</span> I think that this is perhaps not an essential point. I think that in this realm the uses of various religions can be good. The importance is to love God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> But the commandment practical can be various.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like God, if God says that: "You can do this," that is not sin. But if God says that: "You cannot do it", then it is sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> When God says that it is not good to Indian, and says to the Jews that it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Now take... Therefore I say that Jesus Christ, either you call him God, or confidential representative of God, both of them are one, when he says: "Thou shalt not kill," why should we interpret in an another way, to our convenience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, but Jesus eated (French, refers to passover lamb)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Mutton, mutton.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Oh, the sheep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui,</span> the sheeps...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but Jesus Christ never maintained slaughterhouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Non, mais...</span> He eated, he eated, he eated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In certain circumstances, when there is no other food, that a life must be saved. That is another thing. But why regularly slaughterhouse should be maintained for the satisfaction of the tongue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is it clear? (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui.</span> But I think there is, at first, a great duty to help men and women and children to live and actually it is the first duty. It is more important to help men and women to life. The life of beast is of minor importance than the life of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From that point of view, you can kill lower animals. Why should you kill mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui, oui.</span> Mother. Man, as human being is not the same that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it is not moral. Even if you kill animals for maintaining your..., allowing that, there are many other, hundreds and thousands of animals. So if you at all require, people eat also hogs, sometimes, in wartime, they ate dogs also. And there are persons, they regularly eat dogs in Korea. They eat dogs regularly. So even animal killing is necessary for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, yes, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for eating, then at least the mother animal should not be killed. That is from moral point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, from moral point of view...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our point of view is that we don't allow killing any animal. Our Kṛṣṇa says: <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says vegetable, fruits, milk, grains, all these things should be offered to Me with devotion. And you should take the remnants of the foodstuff. So we take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And Kṛṣṇa says: "Give Me foodstuff prepared from this group." That we do. Accepting that the fruits, they have got life. But fruits are by nature... There are many fruits. It is offered by the tree for eating. The tree's not killed. So we accept this philosophy also that a, one animal, one living entity is meant for being food for another living entity. <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> That we also accept, but that does not mean one living entity is the food for another living entity, that does not mean I can kill my mother, my child... That is not, sir. So at least this must be taken into consideration that cows, innocent, they give us milk, we take its milk, and we kill in regular slaughterhouse, this is not very good thing. It is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes. I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Does the fact that Christianity, does the fact that Christianity sanctions eating of meat mean that from the Christian viewpoint, lower species of life do not have a soul like human beings.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says: "No, that yes, this is the philosophy, that, that below the human level, the soul does not inhabit the body of other species."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> The soul, the soul, the soul is, is human soul. In the animal you have some psychologic existence, but not life of spirit with freedom, with mind and with the reality of spirit. But you have the same idea because you said that there is a difference of nature between spiritual creation and the material world. You know, the material world is not of the same essence than the spiritual world. And the man, the man is a part of spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says: <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu.</span> "In all species of life, as many forms are there, so the spirit soul is there." This outward body is just like a dress. You may have a very costly dress, and I may have a very shabby, poor dress, but both of us are human being, or living entities. Similarly these different forms of living entities, they are just like different types of dress. <span class="Italic">Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like you are in black dress.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is external. But within the dress you are a human being, I am also human being. Similarly, there are eight million four hundred thousands of dresses. There are nine hundred thousand dresses within the water, aquatics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, two million kinds of dresses of the trees, plants, like that. In this way the Vedic literatures have calculated, there are eight million, four hundred thousand forms of living entity. But they're all living entities, part and parcel of God. Just like one man has got ten sons. Not all of them equally meritorious. Not all. One may be high-court judge. And one may be ordinary clerk in the office. But father, both the high-court judge and the clerk in the office, father claims both of them as son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Yes, yes, I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For father, there is no such distinction that: "This high-court judge is very important and the clerk in the office, my son, he's not important." So if the enlightened son, high-court judge, says to the father: "My dear father, your, this son, is useless. Let me cut him and eat." Will the father allow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (asks in French if this is clear)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Non.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from this consideration, at least this morality should be observed that cows, they're our mother. We should not kill at least mothers for eating the flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> The difficulty for us is not the idea that it is good for us to respect the life of a cow. The difficulty is the metaphysic reason. You know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, metaphysics, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> It is, it is, it is the idea that all life is parcel of the life of God. You know of this is to us, difficult to admit. We can, there is a very great difference between the life of man who is really called to partake the life of God, and the animal life, who is (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> No. Without, without, impermanent. Life of man is permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that, that difference is due to development of consciousness. The human body, human body, you get developed consciousness. Just like this tree. It is also a living entity, but it's consciousness is not yet fructified. If you cut the tree, it does not resist. But it resists in a very small degree. That is proved by the scientists. The Sir Jagadisha Candra Bose, in Calcutta, he's also a very great scientist. He has made machine: when you cut the tree, it feels and it is recorded in the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And for the animals we can see, when one kills the animals, it resists, it cries, it makes great sound, horrible. So it is the question of development of consciousness. But the, a soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> But, why, why, why God make some animals who eat other animals? There is a fault in the creation because... It is a fault in the creation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The God is very kind. If you want to eat animals, then He'll give facility, good facility. Just like tiger. You become tiger, and eat animals. Those who are animal eaters, unrestrictedly, God will give him the body of a tiger next life so that he can very freely eat. "Why you maintain slaughterhouse? I give you nails and jaws. Just eat." So they are waiting that life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (translates)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cardinal Danielou:</span> Well, (French). I am very joyful to, to speak, to speak with you. And I offer, if I can, tomorrow go to the, to visit the Temple. Yes, yes. I hope I can tomorrow.</div>
