<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His name was Gopāla Banh. Gopāla Banh ...And there was a king, Kṛṣṇacandra. So the kings would relax by joking words by the jokers. That was system formerly. So Gopāla Banh was constructing a house. So the king advised another friend that: "If you go to his new house and evacuate..." Because the house is not yet opened, not yet established, "Then I'll give you one thousand rupees." So this man said: "Yes, I'll go and do it." So he was, he came to Gopāla Banh's house and began to say: "Gopāla Banh! Oh! I am called by nature. Kindly show me where is your privy. I have to pass." So he could understand that: "Why this man has come here to evacuate?" So he: "Yes, yes. Come in, come in, come in." So he opened the new lavatory and brought a big stick. So he said: "Why you have brought the stick?" So he said: "Yes, you can pass, you can pass stool, but if you urine one drop, I'll kill you." So "How it is possible?" "If it is not possible, I cannot allow." So these, these foolish scientific men, "You can speak, but if you use microphone, then I'll kill you." Yes. The Gopāla Banh's policy. They would not say: "Not allow." But in a different way. [break] For political diplomacy. Not directly: "No." But creating such position, it is not. You are chanting also? Sixteen rounds? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> See says she's trying her best to do so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Something is better than nothing.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">[break] ...of our morning lecture, you can question if you like. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor jñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I had one question about the nature of transcendental knowledge. And it said in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that transcendental knowledge is of a nature that it is like fire. It burns to ashes the reactions to sinful activity. But... It may be sort of a nonsense question. But I couldn't understand how it is, what, how it, how, what is the nature of knowledge that it can do this? How does transcendental knowledge burn to ashes the reactions of sinful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you always engage your mind in transcendental topics, naturally all other nonsense topics will be stopped. Or you'll have no interest in such topics. That is burned down. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareśānubhavo viraktir anya... [SB </span>11.2.42]. That is the test. If you increase your devotion, then you'll be not interested in ordinary things. Just like our devotees, they are no more interested in the worldly topics. They do not like to go to the cinema. That is no more interest. We can see the film of Ratha-yātrā, but we are no more interested to see ordinary film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the word <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajña,</span> the knower of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajña.</span> Is that for one who is differentiating himself from this body? In other words, a person who has realized that there is field and there is knower, is he given that title or is the person who cannot make that distinction, is he also given that title?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Anyone who knows that... That I have explained. That everyone is sitting on the floor. So everyone knows that he is not floor. He's different from the floor. Is it very difficult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is knower. Similarly by common sense we can understand that we are not this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It says in the purport: "Now the person who identifies himself with the body is called <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña,</span> the knower of the field."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In the purport it says: "The body is called <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> or the field of activity for the conditioned soul, and the person who identifies himself with the body is called <span class="Italic">kṣetra, kṣetrajña,</span> the knower of the field."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is wrongly written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Ah. It's everyone, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Not just those people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Identifies with the body. He's not <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is wrongly written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That was no my question. This was my question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Oh, it is wrongly written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> From the lecture, from lecture, when one can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who does not identify, it should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Who does not identify. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That's always questioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not, has been mis-edited. If you identify with body, how you know it? Oh, it is a very great mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We can, we can write them, make that correction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Write immediately. One must know that I am not this body. That is knowledge. That is knower. That is common sense. I say: "It is my body." I don't say: "I body." That I explained. One who does, one who knows that "I am not this body," he's real knower. And one who knows that: "I am this body," he does not know. He's in ignorance. Just like Danielou.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> A Kṛṣṇa conscious person, he can maintain his position in family, government, business, anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? All these Pāṇḍavas, they were government men. How they maintained Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja... They were fighting for political reasons. So they were Kṛṣṇa conscious, fully. [break] ...who identifies with this body, he's described as cow or ass. How he can be knower? It is wrongly edited. The word: "Not". It was edited by whom? Hayagrīva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hayagrīva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Jayādvaita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hayagrīva also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Hayagrīva and Jayādvaita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This should be corrected immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> [break] He asked you a question about transcendental knowledge, and actually you explained that knowledge is not one thing, but it's composed of three things, it is the object, the knower and the process. That is all knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Knower, knowledge and the object. The object is Kṛṣṇa and you are knower, or trying to know. And the process is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That's all. If you want to understand Kṛṣṇa, then you have to adopt the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> No other process. It is clearly stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> No other process. No speculative philosophy or meditation. It is not possible. So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the process, you are the knower, and Kṛṣṇa is knowable. That's all. [break] ...vādī, impersonalists, they say ultimately the knower, knowable and the known becomes one. That is their philosophy. Monists. There is no more knower, no knowable, the knower... Simply knowledge. They say simply knowledge. Oneness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You quoted... In the course of your lecture this morning, you quoted that verse from the Tenth Chapter, <span class="Italic">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam.</span> When that knowledge comes, the devotee is qualified by some degree of advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The more he's qualified, the direction comes from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> And what is the... What form does that direction take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> And what form does that direction take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In whichever way. The real direction is that he may come back to home, back to Godhead after giving up this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is that <span class="Italic">buddhi,</span> that intelligence manifested in some way, in his service, or in his thinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Because the process is devotion, <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Bhakti means not idle. Activities. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not idle gossip. It is something, activity. Therefore <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> sometimes misunderstand that they are working like us. So where is the... what does it mean, <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span> Just like Arjuna is fighting. But ordinary man will see that he's a soldier, he's fighting. What is this <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span> But Kṛṣṇa certifies: "Yes, you are My devotee." By fighting, he's devotee. Because he's fighting for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Similarly, by the order of Kṛṣṇa, whatever you do, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Karmīs</span> cannot see. <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> see... [break] <span class="Italic">...tiki, laukikī, vaidikī. Laukikī</span> means material activities. And <span class="Italic">vaidikī</span> means according to Vedic instruction. Whatever you do, if it is done for Kṛṣṇa, then it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Laukikī</span> and <span class="Italic">vaidi...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Laukikī. Laukikī</span> means ordinary, common activities. And <span class="Italic">vaidikī</span> means Vedic. Just like a man is doing business as motorcars. So he has to do business as other motor car dealers do. So this is <span class="Italic">laukikī.</span> It is not <span class="Italic">vaidikī.</span> In <span class="Italic">vaidika</span> instruction, there is no such thing, that "You do motor business like this." Therefore it is <span class="Italic">laukikī.</span> So either <span class="Italic">laukikī</span> or <span class="Italic">vaidikī,</span> if it is done for Kṛṣṇa, it is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Kṛṣṇa also says: <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad... [Bg. 9.27]. Yat karoṣi</span> means whatever you do,... "Whatever" means the activity must be <span class="Italic">laukikī</span> or <span class="Italic">vaidikī.</span> "Whatever." There is no restriction, that only <span class="Italic">vaidikī.</span> No. Even <span class="Italic">laukikī.</span> Whatever you do. Find out this verse: <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi tapasyasi yat.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"O son of Kuntī, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform should be done as an offering unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Purport: "This is the duty of everyone to mold his life in such a way that he will not forget Kṛṣṇa in any circumstance. Everyone has to work for maintenance of his body and soul together, and Kṛṣṇa recommends herein that one should work for Him. Everyone has to eat something to live. Therefore he should accept the remnants of foodstuffs offered to Kṛṣṇa. Any civilized man has to perform some religious..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "You give Me." "Whatever you eat, you give Me," Kṛṣṇa says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "Any civilized man has to perform some religious ritualistic ceremonies. Therefore Kṛṣṇa recommends..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This is <span class="Italic">vaidikī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "...Do it for Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaidikī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> "...and this is called <span class="Italic">arcanā.</span> Everyone has a tendency to give something in charity. Kṛṣṇa says: 'Give it to Me.' And this means that all surplus money accumulated should be utilized in furthering the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Nowadays people are very much inclined to the meditational process, which is not practical in this age. But if anyone practices meditating on Kṛṣṇa twenty-four hours by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> around his beads, he is surely, he is surely the greatest yogi, as substantiated by the Sixth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (indistinct) there's that Prof. Kotovsky who was raising an objection. He was saying that your four-class system may work well in a simple agrarian culture like in India, but here where things are much more complicated, it would never work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already there. He is professor, why? (laughter) That is their rascaldom. They are doing the same thing. But still they are decrying the process. Why you have become professor? You remain ordinary worker. There is no need of professor. Why he has become professor of Indology? And there is two, amongst the workers also, there are two classes, manager class, worker class. You have to divide. Without division... [break] Just like this body is not a lump of matter. There is division. Without division, the body cannot work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So that's no excuse that there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means... these rascals, they have simply imperfect knowledge. Still, they are leader. That is our protest. That why you become leader? You have got so many imperfections. Why you are cheating people? That is our protest. You have no perfect knowledge. Still, you become leader. Why? Why you are cheating men like that? Just like the professor who was speaking that by four, combination of four chemicals, life has come. And as soon as he was challenged that: "If I give you these four chemicals, whether you can produce life?" He said: "That I cannot say." Then what is the use of speaking like that? So they're cheating, and people are being cheated. Still, they're given Nobel Prize. "Oh, here is a big man." They'll talk all nonsense. At, at the same time, they'll become professor, teacher. And people will accept. So at least let us protest against this system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga</span>, that <span class="Italic">kīrtana's</span> too loud downstairs. There was a professor who came to see you in London, the religion professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Professor Hardin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When he said that: "Many times, my students ask me questions that I do not know. So I try to answer." But you said: "If you do not know, you should not teach." You said: "Our philosophy is that if you do not know, you should step down." He said: "I cannot do that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's getting salary, money. No sincerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So actually a devotee has answer for every question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is devotee, who can answer any question. Everything is discussed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Everything, complete knowledge. Now in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said that this cosmic manifestation... Now you find out this verse: <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10]. Mayā.</span> M-a-y-a.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Still too loud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's too loud downstairs. There have been complaints from the neighbors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Loud, they are very good. How can you stop it? As soon as you chant, somebody... That you cannot check. You may stop <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sūyate sa-carācaram<br class="calibre2"/>hetunānena kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>jagad viparivartate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 9.10]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"This material nature is working under my direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings. By its rule this manifestation is created and annihilated again and again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when Kṛṣṇa is directing, is it aimless? The whole cosmic manifestation, is it aimless? There is some purpose. Otherwise, why God has created, and He's directing? These people, they cannot understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They'll challenge. They have arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They will say that: "If you..." Just like... Actually things... There is no order behind things. If you throw a ball against a wall...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is rascal throwing that ball? Who is that rascal? Throwing that ball? If you are giving that example, somebody's throwing ball, who is that rascal, throwing that ball?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Let's say someone who wants to prove there's no direction to the way..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, if you, as soon as you say: "Throwing ball," somebody's throwing. How can you deny it? You give the example, "throwing ball," but throwing ball means somebody's throwing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The original thrower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The motion is given by somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What they said in East Berlin...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What they said in East Berlin, when we were preaching, was that material nature has always been there, and life has come from matter. They say that matter is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They can say anything they want, but that doesn't mean it's logical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Matter is... What is that? Let us understand this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They were saying to us that, that there is no God behind everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now why not? Can, can... Have you got any experience within your experience that anything was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, that's what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that rascaldom. That word say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I just say what they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are saying... Was this tape recorder was existing, or somebody has prepared?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> A man has prepared it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man has prepared it. Then somebody must prepare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But it's man's intelligence that has created that machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, man or somebody, but try to understand generally: Anything that you see, that is created by man or beast or somebody. It is created. So this cosmic manifestation, why do you say that it is not created? It is created. You do not know who has created. That is your ignorance. But as I have no experience, in this material world, which is not created... It is created. You are created. Still. How can you say it is not created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> But then the profane, Prabhupāda, they say that: "Let us carry that logic to the very end, that even God is created. Then why... You say God is having no..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. God is created, you can say. But when a created thing is, then he's not God. Our, our proposition is that everything is created, but finally if we find somebody, he's not created, then he's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They would say: our conclusion was just now that everything has to have been created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Everything has some source of origin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So if everything has some source of origin, how can there be something that does not have a source of origin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when there is no source of origin, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa showed Arjuna His universal form. So He established that He was the origin of everything, and He had no cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The rascals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra: janmādyasya yataḥ.</span> The origin of everything. But He's not originated from something else. And that is God. Therefore He's called Absolute. Everything here is relative. And God is Absolute. That is the difference between Absolute and relative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are like children. They want to see that... They are like children. They want to see that original cause immediately. And if they do not see the original cause immediately, they say there is no original cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is childish. That is childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So let's say someone proposes that God has created everyone equal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> God has created everyone equal. God has created all His children as equal spiritual beings. So why is it that, that one person is fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, and I have no interest in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That means we're not equal, there's some flaw in God's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is your flaw. That is your flaw. God says that: "You simply surrender unto Me." But does it mean that everyone is surrendering to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> No. Then they're not equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Then God's creations are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That, that... Suppose I have got ten sons or so many disciples. I say that: "You do this." Somebody may not do it. That independence everyone has got. So after being so-called independent, when he does not do, according to the instruction of God, he becomes different. God has created everyone equally, but when he disobeys the order of God, then he becomes different. Where is the flaw in this statement? I say everyone of my students that: "Don't do this." But if somebody does it, then he becomes different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Their argument is... They will say that just the fact that the living entity has the independence and, and the possibility is there for him to make a mistake, they consider it to be a flaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If it's better to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But they consider it to be God's flaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why God's flaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Because He has given us the chance to fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Independence means that you may obey me or not obey me. It is not my flaw. Otherwise, independence has no meaning. Independence has no meaning. If I give you independence... Just like Kṛṣṇa is giving independence to Arjuna: "Now I have explained to you everything. Now I give you independence. Either you accept or not accept, that is your position." So if this independence has no such quality, acceptance... That is not independence. If one has to be forced by the law of God, that is not independence. Then one does not know what is the meaning of independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Then why has He given us independence if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He must give because we, He, He has got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...if we misuse it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got, He's the Supreme Independent, and living entities are part and parcel of God. Therefore you must have independence. Otherwise, how he becomes perfect part and parcel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> And if he did not have independence, that would be the flaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That will be the fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That makes everything complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Independence means that you can do or not do. That is independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Their definition of perfect is wrong. Just like this boy's definition of a poet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a rascal. He's simply bogus. He's trying to... There are so many parties like that. They're four or five, they make a group and imitate these Beatles. As if... Beatles have made money. They'll also make money. That is the... And speak all nonsense. That's all. These are crazy fellows. So independence means that you can do or not do. Just like you, as a nation, American nation, or English nation, you are all independent. But why you go to the jail? Is it government's fault that you go to the jail? Therefore government has fault? Why this nonsense question. When a man, instead of going to the university, goes to the police custody, is it government's fault? Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? It is a common sense affair. The God has given you independence. If you do something wrong, against the will of God, then you must suffer. Therefore we find so many varieties of living entities. In different grades of life. That is due to misuse of independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Very popular today is the idea that if we are use, misusing our independence, it's because of our upbringing, our childhood, our society, something is wrong in our psychology. Not that it's the soul, not that it's a question of spiritual problem, but material one, that our parents were cruel or our society, our education was imperfect or something. But not spiritual problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is independence. Your parents were cruel. Therefore you have revolted against the parents. That is your independence. Why you revolted against parents? Because you have got the independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What shall we say to someone, Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, if you are doing stereotyping, then in spite of your father being cruel, you would not declare independence and go away from home. Because you have got this independence, therefore you can understand that: "Why shall I obey this father? I go out." That is independence. They do not understand the meaning of independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because they've lost their independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Because they've lost their independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not lost. Misused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Fallen into <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Or misused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not lost. Independence still there. He can go back again to father, go back to home, back to Godhead. God says that: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān...</span> "You have come here to enjoy your independence, but you have created a havoc, entanglement. Now, if you simply surrender unto Me, abide by My orders, I give you all concessions. Immediately you are free from all reaction and come back to Me." Therefore, God comes to canvass, He sends His devotee to canvass, that: "You give up your misuse of independence and become happy." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness program. But if you still stick to the independence, misuse of independence, you remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The trouble with these philosophies is these philosophers are simply stubborn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The problem with these different discussions is these philosophers are simply stubborn. When they hear a better philosophy, they still will not change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that is independence. That is also independence. You accept: "Yes, what you say, it is right. But I'll not accept." That is also independence, misuse of independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Like Dhṛtarāṣṭra, when he heard the arguments from Vidura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So God's creation is perfect. There is no imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Does there come a time Śrīla Prabhupāda, when one misuses his independence, the independence is taken away? For example, if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now why shall He take away. What He has given to you, why He shall take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> In animal life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Animal life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal life, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do animals also have independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have got little independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They say, "All is instinct."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say. They say, all rascals say. But actually this is independence, but because they're animals, they are directed by nature, more or less. Just like they do not... My point is they do not misuse independence as much as a human being does. You see. Just like a tiger. He is to eat animals, killing animals. He does not come to your orchard to steal your fruits. But you, rascal human being, you eat fruits and animals both. Animal, that is instinct. Animal... Suppose if you put-I've given this example many times-a bag of rice on the street. Many birds will come. But he will eat some grains, five grains, ten grains and twenty grains, as much he can eat, and go away. But you do the same favor to the human beings, there will be fight. Everyone will try to take some more quantity in the house and stock it. Therefore, the human being is more responsible for sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> So the rascal thinks that independence, the manifestation, the symptom of independence is to misuse independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> He thinks the symptom... I am independent. I will show you I am independent. I will misuse my independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There's... Just like you are a citizen of French government. You are also independent. If the government says that if you do this, then you'll be punished. So when you do that, that is misuse of independence. Otherwise you are independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> So real independence means to surrender then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. To authority. Because you have to surrender. If you don't surrender to God, then you have to surrender to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like you don't surrender to government, then you have to surrender to the superintendent of jail. That's all. If you misuse your independence, you'll not be happy. This is the fact. But you have got the independence. You can misuse it. That is your prerogative. That is your freedom. Freedom means you must have independence. But because you are not absolutely independent, so you suffer. The Absolute Independent is God, Kṛṣṇa. Just like government. The government orders: let this crowd be shot. Let there be bullet shot. Hundreds of men die. But government is not responsible for such death. But if you kill one man, you'll be responsible. So your independence is subordinate independence. Similarly, all living entities, they have been given independence by God, but his independence is subordinate to the independence of God. This is our position, <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There are so many young people who, when we try to preach to them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we explain that it means to accept the position of service, service position, they reject it because they have no experience of service that is satisfying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? They have rejected so many things. Why not your proposal? Just like the hippies. They have rejected so many things. Why shall he accept your proposal? Why you think that your proposal is so nice, he'll accept immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That doesn't mean we don't preach to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That doesn't mean we don't preach...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You preach. You just purify them. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Let him hear. Then he'll accept. Then he will gradually come. Yes.

So as we gradually increase our strength, our number, we have to protest to the world that: "Why you rascal and fools, keeping the whole human society in darkness? You have no knowledge." Here God says that: 'Under My direction the prakṛti's working.' You have no knowledge. You are saying that there is no aim. Without aim, why God should create this, such a big gigantic manifestation. Why He should take responsibility? Is there no responsibility to maintain this gigantic... God has got immense power. He can maintain. That is another thing. But why He should take the responsibility? Just like government creates a big prison house. It is not for nothing. There is some aim. Otherwise, why government should keep such establishment, huge establishment? It is not something faith(?). They are to be given cloth and shelter and everything, the arrangement. Similarly such gigantic universal manifestation, millions and millions of living entities are there. They have to be trained up. They have to be provided with all necessities of life. This responsibility's there. And actually God is doing that. He's giving food. He's giving necessities. Why? There is some aim. The aim is that they have misused their independence. Try to reform them again (indistinct). This is the aim. All these living entities in the material world, the have misused their independence. Therefore, they are in the material world. Otherwise why should they remain in the material world? Anyone who is in this material world, it is to be understood that he's misused his independence. (end)</div>
