<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not this, not that. That will not help. You must act in such a way that these people accept you as superior. [break] ...(Hindi) [break] ...not a paid servant. [break] ...bring Bhagavān at your control. You can bring Him at your control by love. Just like Yaśodāmayī... She's showing the stick: "Kṛṣṇa, if you do like this, then I will chastise you." And He's crying. That is <span class="Italic">premā.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Premā pum-artho mahān.</span> That is the highest achievement, to achieve the love of Godhead. And if you love God, then you achieve love of everyone. (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I like you calling me... "What is that, what you are doing now?" (laughs) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] ...anya Mahāprabhu has taught us that to remain a fool and rascal before spiritual master is the first qualification of the disciple. Always remain a fool and rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu preached after, after...</div>

"My Guru Mahārāja has chastised Me, considering Me a fool number one." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">guru more mūrkha dekhi.</span> "My Guru Mahārāja saw Me a first-class <span class="Italic">mūrkha,</span> fool. And therefore he has chastised Me." That is the standard of guru and <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> A guru... And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">lālane bahavo doṣāḥ.</span> If you pat, there are so many bad things. <span class="Italic">Lālane bahavo doṣās tāḍane bahavo guṇāḥ.</span> And if you chastise, there are so many good qualities. <span class="Italic">Tasmāt putraṁ ca śiṣyaṁ ca taḍayet.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na tu lalayet.</span> Therefore either son or disciple, you must always chastise him, not pat him, "Oh, you are very good boy." "You are nothing. You are doing nothing." That is the business of the guru, to find out fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Don't spare the rod.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although there is no fault, the guru's business is to: "Where is his fault?" That is guru's business. <span class="Italic">Tasmād taḍayet na tu lalayet.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yesterday you had a very big congregation here? Or all the chairs were kept out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People were coming. Therefore we have given. Not very big congregation, but many people came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are doing in the Fourth<span class="Italic"> Adhyāya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he is a born <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> and also wants to be a king, he can't be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is... Because you are... You are... We are, rather, we are also <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas.</span> (laughs) Therefore we select a <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> as president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Select. We have selected him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] Any intelligent man will say like that. I said... When they fought so much for Hindi language, I said that "Why not Sanskrit?"</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...both you and Me, we have changed so many times, taken birth. But you have forgotten. I have not forgotten." Why this difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because God has got the same body throughout in all the <span class="Italic">avatāras,</span> while you change your body. <span class="Italic">Icchā-dveṣa samutthena dvandva-mohena bhārata</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>7.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> By, at that time...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam.</span> You are not <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> but if you think Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You sometimes call me a very intelligent man and other times you call me a dud. Now who am I? I forget myself. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> The so-called, the so-called big, big leaders, big, big philosophers, and big, big scholars, they have accepted Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being or "There was no Kṛṣṇa." Just see how much <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, they... There is a section of scholars who think that Kṛṣṇa was not a personality at any time, but it is a legend. But others say that even if it is a legend, it is worth following and worshiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Both of them are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Because one who thinks that it is not a fact, and one who thinks that, "Even it is not fact...," both of them do not know actually.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Abuddhayaḥ.</span> That is the position. "God is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> Now He has assumed a form, accepting <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" This is Māyāvāda philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but the difference between God and us, that the God has control over the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> while we are controlled by the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the <span class="Italic">jīvas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not know what is <span class="Italic">māyā</span> even.</div>
