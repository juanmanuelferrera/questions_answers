<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That Blitz article, I wrote a reply and sent it to Krishna Modi, the member of Parliament and he's going to discuss it with the other members of Parliament. What I did...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this article is in our favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, the previous one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So but Mr. Modi said that we don't bother about this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no, he'll reply. So I gave him the point. He wanted me to give him the point and the right answers and then he will reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the points?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I read the whole letter you? It's a four page letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Dear Shri Modiji. Hare Kṛṣṇa. In Blitz issue of August 21, 1976, an article under the heading of "Blitz Tears the Mask of Ungodly Face of Kṛṣṇa Cult" appeared. This article appeared on page 3 of the issue and was written by A. Ragwan of Blitz Delhi Bureau. We beg to state that this was a mischievous article in which the newspaper accused us incorrectly. It is our firm opinion that the purpose of this article was simply to defame ISKCON because it is engaged in spreading God consciousness based on the Vedic scriptures. For your information, ISKCON is a registered society with the government of India. This society..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For your information we beg to submit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. For your information... Before that I have said. "For your information ISKCON is a registered society with the government of India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, "for your infor..." It is not completed. "For your information..." What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, this is a sentence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "This society was formed strictly for the purpose of spreading God consciousness. We briefly submit below the misleading information as reported by Blitz and humbly inform you of the fact." What I've done is I've shown each point that Blitz has incorrectly said and then responded to it. Should I read? Okay. "Point one. Blitz Ungodly Face of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness. ISKCON: The International Society for Kṛṣṇa Consciousness is a worldwide community of devotees practicing the Vedic teachings, the eternal science of rendering devotional service to Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Society was founded by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, a pure devotee of God, who is coming down in <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> started by Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa five thousand years ago. In other words, the roots of this movement trace back to at least five thousand years. It is not a modern concoction. In India our Society is registered under the Society Registration Act #21 of 1860. As we are a registered nonprofit organization, we are required to maintain complete account of all donations received, both within India and from abroad. Thus keep a complete account of all our expenses. Our accounts are audited every year and submitted to the income tax authorities and the charity commissioner. Very briefly, the main object of the Society, as registered with the government is..." I've given them the three main points from your memorandum of the association. "To advance, transmit, and spread the ethical and philosophical principles of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as revealed in the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And the doctrines and the observances which serve to promote and manifest the said ethical and philosophical principles in the furtherance of the subject. To build or to assist in building temples, schools, colleges, hospitals, and other buildings in connection with or for the advancement of the objects of the Society and to maintain, alter, and improve the same, including existing buildings, and to furnish and equip the same. To print, publish, sell, or cause to be printed, published or sold, or to distribute books, booklets, leaflets, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly newspapers, magazines, or other periodicals for the purpose of giving information for the work of the Society. We refrain from four categories of sinful activities, such as meat-eating, intoxication, gambling, and illicit sex life. Furthermore, our entire life is dedicated to reading, chanting, and preaching about Kṛṣṇa. We rise at 4 a.m. all over the world. So how can Blitz say that we are ungodly when we are following Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa's teachings?" This is my reply to point one. It's okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is nice. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Point two. Blitz And now it's ISKCON-MRA-Anand Marg..." Just for your information Prabhupāda, MRA and Anand Marg were banned organizations for murders...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> MRA also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it is banned now. So Blitz said, "And now it's ISKCON-MRA-Anand Marg." So ISKCON is replying. ISKCON: "Blitz is trying to link us with banned organizations like MRA and Anand Marg. We challenge Blitz to show any of our activity that is dangerous to the Indian society. Our only business is to follow <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is all we are asking others to do also. We're not engaged in any political activity either. So how can Blitz compare us to banned organizations like MRA and Anand Marg?" So this is my reply to point two. "Point three. Blitz: ISKCON was founded in New York in July, 1966. ISKCON: Yes, ISKCON was registered in New York by A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. Bhaktivedanta Swami went to America at the advanced age of 70 to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness because he was ordered so by his spiritual master, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda, the founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of Gauḍīya Maṭha institutions in India, to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the Western countries. Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda strongly desired that the whole world accept Lord Kṛṣṇa's teachings and therefore he ordered his most educated and sincere disciple, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda in 1936 to spread these teachings to the Western world. Bhaktivedanta Swami started translating <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in 1936. When the late prime minister, Shri Lal Bahadur Sastri, saw Bhaktivedanta Swami's <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> he said, "His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is doing valuable work, and his books are a significant contribution to the salvation of mankind.' Presently Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, a division of ISKCON has published over sixty books of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. These include <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> 25 volumes, and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> 17 volumes. These books have been acclaimed by both Indian and Western scholars. The books are being used by about three thousand universities all over the world, including Oxford, Cambridge, and Harvard universities. In India, in the last four months, close to four hundred institutes have placed standing orders on Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda's books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta University purchased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I said four hundred universities. I didn't... "Even Russian scholars have praised Bhaktivedanta Swami's books and placed orders. For your information, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust is the leading seller of books of Vedic culture outside India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Topmost publisher of religious and philosophical... In the world. That is admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I said outside India because <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> Press... It becomes disputable in India. So this was my reply to point three. "Point four. Blitz: Most work in India is done by foreign devotees. ISKCON: The founder-<span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of ISKCON is His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, who is an Indian. His chief secretary for India is also an Indian. In total, ISKCON has presently about 270 devotees in India, of which at least 150 or about 60% are Indian. Our programs in India have been praised by all leaders. The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, while inaugurating our Hyderabad center on August 18, 1976, said, "History appears to be repeating itself. One found a revival of temple construction, temple worship, and <span class="Italic">Gītā-prayana</span> in advanced countries like U.S.A."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">Gītā-prayana. Gītā-parāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Parāyaṇa.</span> Okay. I just copied the spelling from the paper, <span class="Italic">Parāyaṇa.</span> Okay, I'll change it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, that is understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. "He complimented ISKCON, for disseminating the Vedic culture. West Bengal government officials have praised our agricultural efforts. The principle officer of agriculture of Nadia District in West Bengal said that our Māyāpura farm is receiving attention of nearby farmers, and this farm is acting as a demonstration for them. So the statement that foreign devotees are running ISKCON in India is misleading. Point five, Blitz: Big business in Spiritual Sky. Boss of West Bengal is Gregory M. Scharf. ISKCON: In Māyāpura our devotees make handloom saris, <span class="Italic">dhotīs,</span> and <span class="Italic">gāmchās.</span> All over the world our devotees wear the traditional Indian dress of <span class="Italic">dhotīs, kurtās,</span> and saris. It is our spiritual master's desire that all our devotees overseas only wear clothes made by our devotees in Māyāpura. Spiritual Sky sales and services was formed just to send our Māyāpura handloom and other necessities only to our centers overseas. In return our overseas centers send Māyāpura donations. Even Gandhiji wanted every Indian to be self-sufficient. This is what we are trying to do. We produce our own food and clothing. Instead of criticizing, Blitz should publicize these activities so that others can follow. Gregory M. Scharf's spiritual name is Gargamuni Swami, and he is an initiated disciple of Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. Blitz has tried to portray him as a businessman who's wearing saffron clothes to deceive people. He is a sannyāsī since 1966. Point six, Blitz: Substantial amounts of foreign money is being received by ISKCON India Limited. ISKCON: First of all, our society is registered and called ISKCON, not ISKCON India Limited." They are purposefully being sarcastic. "It is not a business house. Yes, we do receive remittances from abroad. Every paisa that has been remitted from abroad has come through the reserve bank of India. Bhaktivedanta Swami has written over eighty books which are being sold in every country in the world. These books are selling twelve doubled(?) sixty thousand dollars daily which is about five <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> We have over a hundred centers all over the world and all these centers are being run by book sales. In the last three years, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust has published over two million hardbound big books. About three and a half million softbound medium size books and about fifteen million magazines on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you can see the wide acceptance of these books. Out of the 2,800 major universities in America, about ninety percent have purchased one or more of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda's books. Occasionally we receive contributions. This is not in cash but in kind. For example, Alfred Ford donated two buildings to our Society, one in Honolulu Hawaii, and the other in Detroit, America. In London..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. You can go and play. You cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Go and play. "In London, George Harrison donated a big castle which is now called Bhaktivedanta Manor. We have purchased many buildings and converted them to temples from the sale of our books. What is wrong if a portion of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust sales are transferred to India for construction of temples? Fifty percent of Bhaktivedanta Book Trust income is spent for further publishing and the other fifty percent is spent to build temples all over the world. In fact, Blitz should appreciate this because Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda's books are bringing valuable overseas currency into the country without any cost to the Indian public. Point seven. Blitz: In Bombay they have put up a temple with a barbed fence around it. ISKCON There is no barbed wire around the temple. We invite Blitz to show us the barbed wire." There's no barbed wire. "Point eight. Blitz: Already rupees twelve lakhs have been spent on an unfinished temple in Vṛndāvana. ISKCON: Blitz does not know that the Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple in Vṛndāvana was completed and officially inaugurated by Dr. Chenna Reddy, governor of U.P., in April, 1975." They are saying the temple is still being made. "Point nine. Blitz: Their major center seems to be in Orissa, the land of princes and paupers. They have built a center close to an atomic energy commission complex. ISKCON: How foolish. Our major center is not in Orissa, but in Śrīdhāma Māyāpura in West Bengal. Māyāpura is the birthplace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, an incarnation of Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa. We are coming in Lord Caitanya's disciplic succession and therefore we want to develop Māyāpura and make this an international center. In Orissa, we do have two devotees living in three huts in Bhuvaneśvara. They are living on a piece of land that was donated by one of our life members from Calcutta. If at all it is near the Atomic Energy Commission, it is only by coincidence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was donated by the late governor and Central Minister. Nityananda Kananda. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He donated it. Okay, I'll write down his name them. "Gaura-Govinda Swami, a 45 year old retired teacher from Orissa is in charge of our Bhuvaneśvara center." So they'll know. "Point ten..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that land was donated by a prominent man. Nityananda Kananda (?) was central government minister and later on governor of Gujarat. And he often comes to see me in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Point ten. Blitz: It has started taking interest in politics. It has started a political party in U.S.A. called "In God We Trust" party. ISKCON: ISKCON is not involved in politics at all anywhere in the world. Two American devotees did contest some civic elections for which a party called 'In God We Trust' was formed. The purpose of that campaign was to remind everyone to remember the Lord at all times, as everything belongs to God. Our spiritual master dissolved In God We Trust party in U.S.A. four years ago. Furthermore, there were never any plans to set up In God We Trust in India. We challenge Blitz to show us any evidence to support their claim. Point eleven. Blitz: As far back as 1971, the Maharastra government has taken action against the foreign devotees who have chosen to overstay in Bombay and elsewhere. ISKCON: This statement is also incorrect. The Maharastra government has never taken any action against our devotees. Point twelve. Blitz: The government has decided to stop specialized facilities rendered to foreign devotees seeking to popularize Kṛṣṇa in India. ISKCON: We are very grateful to the government of India for giving us facilities for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The government has not withdrawn any special facilities that have been given to us earlier. So I'm sure you can see by now the extent to which Blitz has misreported ISKCON activities in India. Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that one day in every town and village of the world this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement would be spread. The Vedic culture is India's real heritage and we want to popularize it in every corner of the world. Even in black Africa we have locals that have joined."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every corner of the world for world peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, for "world peace." Do you have a pen? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You don't have any light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I need my pen. It's missing. I found it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because this is the only platform for united nations which is practically demonstrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the only platform for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> United Nations which is practically demonstrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...is practical... (writing down)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our movement, all over the world they have joined. Hindu, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, and Africans. All, everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "ISKCON has devotees in all parts of the world in all nationalities, including Muslims."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu-bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Should the government need any further information we will be more than happy and pleased to cooperate in all respects. With kindest regards. Your sincerely, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa dāsa, Secretary, ISKCON." It's okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is nicely done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So this is a point by point reply. So now no one can open their mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. It is very intelligent. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And I thought we'd give both Blitz and ISKCON so you can see right there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if Mr. Modi discusses this it will be a great help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Now the other book I want to write, it's facts about ISKCON, or what is ISKCON. We will call that booklet "What is ISKCON." And then in a question and answer form, give all the answers. What is ISKCON, where does ISKCON get its income from, who are the people who run ISKCON, everything that they ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it came from Delhi from shopping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are shopping from Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was supposed to go to Delhi, few items. They're better and cheaper sometimes. So now I'll work on the other booklet which the defense minister wanted, "What is ISKCON." A small, like "Kṛṣṇa Consciousness is Authorized," on that form with some reviews.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can start this fan. No, no. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> The mains has been turned off, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There is no water coming from the mains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've turned the water off somewhat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is dropping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, it's raining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then we cannot sit. [break] ...book is going on. (Bengali) This is our childhood song. (Bengali) The small drops of rain falling, now their will be flood in the river. (Bengali) [break] We know even in October sometimes there are rains. Because the <span class="Italic">Durgā Pūjā</span> takes place in October. From our childhood we have experience. During <span class="Italic">Durgā Pūjā</span> there was raining, fog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We haven't got rid of those monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They've gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. There's some on the roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The (indistinct) is there? In the open?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, it's undercover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was just telling him the monkeys are still there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're still there? They've gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I've just seen five minutes ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We know where those monkeys are coming from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The monkeys live on the porch. One of those porches on the guest house where Arundhatī's room is. Around the other side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're not in the dome. We looked into that. It's covered. Dome's completely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the top room they have not closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they have balconies. They said... I was told that they're living on one of the balconies around the other side where Arundhatī's room is. They don't chase them away so they just stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I just want the name of the person who gave us that land in Orissa because I'm getting this retyped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The name is Nityananda Kananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kananda. What was his title before? What was he...? Ex-governor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a minister in the central government, deputy minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Deputy minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deputy minister in the central government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> During when? Approximately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> During Jawaharlal Nehru's time. And later on governor of Gujarat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Governor of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gujarat. Now he's retired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay, this is very good. This will get them to shut up their mouth completely. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? Why you are unnecessarily...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not... Just dripping a little bit. It's not so bad. I'm just wearing the <span class="Italic">cādara</span> to keep the mosquitos off. I'm getting bitten, so I'm wearing a <span class="Italic">cādara </span> to keep the insects away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is coming again. (fountain starts) [break] ...very celebrated astrologer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. He said, "Well, Bhaktisiddhānta Mahārāja was."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he gave up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's what I told him. Instead of Sūryasiddhānta he became Bhaktisiddhānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he wanted he could have practiced lucratively. But he gave up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he had many students. (pause) (indistinct) He dropped in the fountain?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He swims around sometimes inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like it. But they make sound. [break] So if actually I am serious to serve Kṛṣṇa I must begin immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So that means utilizing whatever you already know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's right. Because there is no guarantee. Suppose you are learning some art to serve Kṛṣṇa. In the meantime if death takes place...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then no service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if you could not learn the art, at the same time you miss Kṛṣṇa's service. So that is not our principle. We want to serve Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> Whatever work you already expert, you do that. Just like he is doing. Whatever he knows, he is giving service. He's not going for sewing cloth. Because he does not know that. Why should he waste time? He knows this art, let him do. That is service. Whatever you know, Kṛṣṇa can accept any service. Kṛṣṇa is not one-sided. Because He is everything, so he can accept every service, anything. That is stated, <span class="Italic">svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> Whatever you know, you try to please Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa's representative.

Why he should go to <span class="Italic">Āyur-vedic?</span> That is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Long time ago you wrote a letter to Jadurāṇī to do that. Jadurāṇī, she wants to do service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I thought that when she first came I saw that here she has got a little tendency for painting. So I engaged immediately, that you go on painting, whatever you can. So in the beginning she was not good painter. But still I said, "Anyway, you paint Caitanya Mahāprabhu, Nityānanda. And whatever you paint, it is accepted." It is not the art, but it is the service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> His point was that he doesn't have any service. So he was thinking if he learned something, because he already has a medical background...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him serve in that way. If he has got a little medical background, let him utilize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. He wanted to branch out into <span class="Italic">Āyur-vedic </span> so that he could...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his whims. That is not service.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We were doing that in Māyāpura. I remember last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there are so many banana leaves. You can utilize it. One leaf is sufficient for four plates at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Actually I must confess, generally most days I use a bit of banana leaf to take some of your remnants on. Take a bit on a banana leaf, and then take from there. It is very handy. Actually the monkeys they come and also they eat this leaf. They often come and tear off a piece of leaf and sit on this eating them. Monkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is destructive. They do not know.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. They cut the skull off a live monkey. They cut the skull off like egg and drink the brain through straw. I read in magazine how they do this. It's very common practice now.</div>

So then he said he went to see Sai Baba, and then Sai Baba looked at him and he said, "Oh, you have been in an accident and your car was hit by the train.

He was six year old Śrī Kṛṣṇa. So this Sai Baba refused to answer the questionnaire. He said, "Why should I respond to these people?"</div>
