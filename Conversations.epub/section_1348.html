<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...days till you get a little more strength. I mean this is a very good sign Śrīla Prabhupāda. You've taken a half a kilo of milk. No mucus, no stool. If you get a few days of strength... I mean I have no objection even tomorrow to take you. I just would like to hear what the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>... I really have a little faith in him. I mean I have all faith on you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I have only a little faith in him, but I don't want to reject his advice as a doctor. This <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is giving sound advice so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're just trying to get him here. He went out again to get some more medicine for you. He says now that he's seen that you took this half kilo of milk he's going to start to give a medicine that will make this milk make muscles on your body, because all the muscles have become finished, slackened. So he wants to do that so that you'll then have strength. Parikramming the temple is not so bad. Let's just see what he says. It's certainly not that difficult. The main thing is, you have to be able to sit up for some time. (aside:) Prabhupāda wants to become enlivened spiritually, you know, by some spiritual activity. (to Prabhupāda:) We'll ask the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> if he thinks we can take you tomorrow for a short <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> around the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> He just got on the phone. I just talked with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's coming back? I couldn't believe that... I felt so bad, seeing him tonight. He was sitting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, on the fountain steps, completely dejected. Couldn't understand why. He just was so, so disappointed and unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the way you deal with us simply deepens our attachment every moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is my duty. (laughter) There was a professor in Scottish Churches' College. So when you would say something, he would reply, "That's my duty," "juti," j-u-t-i. (chuckles) So there was a student. He said... So he said, "Is that Scottish pronunciation?" [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What would you like, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pass urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...properly fixed up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it properly fixed up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Finished, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About 40 cc's, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali) (Bengali conversation continues for some time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are you comfortable, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I want little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Little?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that "my," Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> "My" must mean massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Massage? Where, Śrīla Prabhupāda? On your leg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the corner of the waist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Both sides?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, left side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll put a little oil on? It's against aching. This is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brisk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is that oil you liked for pains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> On the back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Upendra said. "Should I put a little?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Is this mattress hard for you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It becomes harder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This whole waist area? This whole area?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bon Mahārāja came actually, but he did not come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Where he came to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> He was waiting in his college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He did not come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> He said that "Go there... I will see Mahārāja at this time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How we can give a fixed time? Actually it's better you get a little bit stronger before receiving guests, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If you see him you will be doing a lot of preaching and talking. He's still here in Vṛndāvana, Bon Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What time is good, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Ten o'clock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Tomorrow there is function.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, tomorrow's function. Day after tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> <span class="Italic">Ha,</span> day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tomorrow is no good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What time is convenient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Every time.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Day or night is the same for you now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So day after tomorrow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll send a car, say, at about half past eleven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Past eleven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Eleven-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Good time? Is that all right with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask Bābājī Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You also come. Where will you be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> I am at the Imlitala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So first we will pick you up.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali )</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? They will take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> here? Bhakti-caru Mahārāja cooks very, very first class Bengali <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Very best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They should take here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> The evening on Saturday, er, Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> On Sunday in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sunday evening. That means tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> No. Day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Tomorrow is Saturday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tomorrow is Saturday. Day after tomorrow. Tomorrow is Saturday?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six o'clock. You tell Bon Mahārāja, say, at... We will pick you up earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> No, I'll come to Bon Mahārāja's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Then five-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Five-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right? Yes? And they will take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> So make it even a little later, say six-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> Six-thirty. Not six-thirty. Five-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm? Five-thirty's better. Okay. <span class="Italic">Ṭhike.</span> Five-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (laughing) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Bhakti-caru Mahārāja, you have to make nice <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> Sunday evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (aside:) He's going now? So we will take him back. You arrange. He'll come. Anudeśa, you arrange for the car also. Help Bhakti-caru. Is this giving you a little relief, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Massaging your legs are Bhavānanda Mahārāja and Girirāja. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soda water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Bol,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The soda-water sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Soda water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Soda water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't hear the sound of soda water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, I do. Oh, that's the water bucket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some water was boiling, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That was the sound of boiling water. In America people always keep the teapot boiling. So similarly, here, Upendra, he always keeps a pot of water boiling, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He is always ready to serve you with warm water. Whenever you need warm water... So that's one of the things. Always there is some water boiling here. You must be very tired today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You've done a great deal of talking. [break] (Hindi with <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's asking whether Śrīla Prabhupāda is feeling stronger. He said yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying that Prabhupāda's pulse is ninety, which is normal, and he gave three other medicines for Prabhupāda's heart. That missing beat that Prabhupāda was having-that's no more there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were having a missing beat in your pulse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali) He is telling that he's requesting repeatedly that Prabhupāda doesn't talk too much. He says that the energy that he's building, the moment he starts talking, he loses that energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how to say all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Trying to stop Śrīla Prabhupāda from speaking is like trying to stop the Gaṅgā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Shastriji's saying that he's seen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of patients, but he hasn't seen a body like Śrīla Prabhupāda's. In one moment it is very critical, and the next moment it's in perfect order. And he is now absolutely confident that Prabhupāda is going to get well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He is or isn't?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is. We also are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And he's just requesting Śrīla Prabhupāda that he keeps on taking the milk and the fruit juice and the medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda? (end)</div>
