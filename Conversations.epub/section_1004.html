<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That roof is the fifth story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sixth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixth. So we are finishing fifth only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are finished will be six stories. Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only fifth, up floors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, you can't go more than that. This is near the airport. Now they've introduced a new law that you can't go even below this. What we did is the new law has just come into effect, and so we did the slabs in the night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a new law which reduces the height even further. You can't have any big buildings in Bombay now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know the reason, but apparently Indira Gandhi doesn't like big buildings. So actually according to the new law we have already built more than what the legal limit is. So what we did...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got some assetship(?) for the road? We have left over? Where is Saurabha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Saurabha is in the front. Shall I call him?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When it is built it will be I think just like Vṛndāvana. Many people think that the temple is these two towers. They think that the actual temple are these towers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is included in the... [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no tap water here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have tap water, but it's not drinking water. I mean it needs to be boiled. In Delhi you can drink the tap water, they say it's okay, but in Bombay it's very risky to drink tap water. Especially in monsoon. [break] ...famous actress and singer called Shri Lakshna-pandit. She's one of our devotee's sister-in-law also. She has some devotion. So she is coming to sing <span class="Italic">bhajanas</span> tomorrow in the <span class="Italic">pandal.</span> Is that okay? She's very famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before Deity one can do. Before Deity one can show devotional activities, but not otherwise. Otherwise it will be sense enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Vṛndāvana once you told me not to have the <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā</span> by these professionals also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are, some space is due to us on account of giving up the road?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Good air.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We're invited to do <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> to inaugurate a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha</span> and the Dvārakā Śaṅkarācārya will be present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's Sumati Morarji's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> I don't know what the place is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's somewhere in Braverly, but she's sponsoring or she's associated with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's probably a Vallabha <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we have no objection with Vallabha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They're sending two cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> This morning. So I wanted to invite him to come and see the temple and Your Divine Grace...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About that Vallabhācārya, she wrote me letter, I've replied it. I replied it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, Girirāja told me. I never mention those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, don't mention it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Because they don't listen. Their history is that Vallabhācārya had the dream and discovered Govardhana and Śrī Nāthajī, Gopāla Deity, and there was no Mādhavendra Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> But in the court it has been established. One lawyer in Delhi, he told me that this Deity belongs to the Gauḍīya-sampradāya. In the court it has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How did it come to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Mādhavendra Purī or somebody delivered to Vallabhācārya. Mādhavendra Purī is not possible, somebody else. [break] Dvārakā Śaṅkarācārya, he's a Māyāvādī, and he'll give <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, he's just going to give blessings to the... He's presiding, I guess. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also complete like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. The other side we are making one special room for you on the roof. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One special room like this? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is the lift room. But next to that, the similar room, the same size. It is not done. Because that we have to do later on. We're not allowed to do that now. There's a new law passed in Bombay that no one can build higher than six stories, nowhere in Bombay. So we had to rush for this, otherwise they would have stopped us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are not rushing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No, this is finished. We have reached the highest. That point is the highest. It's only for the slab. Afterwards, they don't mind. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from this light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The switch is just in front of Prabhupāda's door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a seat? Where is gone, that seat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They probably took it in because of the rain. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...rainy season these leaves should have been very green, but it is not green. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> It's also the sea wind that kills a lot of trees. Not so much here, but if one goes down to the sea, all trees they have no leaves. There's some type of salt or something in the air that destroys plants. Here it's all right, but close to the sea it's all... That must affect them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">saptāha,</span> it is not authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No. But in some editions of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> they have a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-māhātmyam,</span> and there's a story about <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> and <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> and Nārada Muni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That no <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> has mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's Gītā Press again. That's Gītā Press.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They say how this is the instructions for how <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> should be read in seven days up to this canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gītā Press was Māyāvādī. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This lady? That man there? He's our accountant, Mr. Krishna. He lives with us full time. He's doing very good service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> About two months ago in Hyderabad they had a very big <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha.</span> One thousand and eight <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> chanting <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> for seven days, and it was presided over by a big Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> Rāmānuja-sampradāya. And all the local Marwaris, they gave <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees for <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They hurt our collection, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> No, they haven't given anything to our temple, but for this, the same people, some of them, most of them refused even to become members. One man who refused me to become a member, he gave fifty thousand rupees for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they refused us or help us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's talking about some <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha</span> they had there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They are the "Hindus." We are the foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But they don't go too long, because in Ahmedabad they have started one Gujarat, one <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-hṛdaya-pīṭha.(?)</span> Just outside Ahmedabad. And he had a plan to build a whole huge temple and <span class="Italic">dharmaśālās</span> and schools, <span class="Italic">gurukulas.</span> That Krishna Shankara Shastri, that poor fellow, he started something, and now he has scarcity, he cannot find funds to finish his project. So the project is lying idle for almost two years. They collected sixty, seventy <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> initially, but then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty seventy <span class="Italic">lakhs?</span> And he squandered it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No. He has got land and he has got some buildings, but now he has no funds to go further. And there also no local people give. All he collected in London and Africa from the Gujaratis. [break] ...in becoming trustees and managing the things, but they will not give any money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So bring some sitting place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Every <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> got 116 rupees, and they brought him a <span class="Italic">cādara</span> and they paid for <span class="Italic">prasāda. Lakhs</span> of people came from all over central India, Andhra Pradesh, thousands and thousands. They paid for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Whole <span class="Italic">pandal,</span> huge <span class="Italic">pandal,</span> they went to this exhibition ground. They gave, the rest of the money went to the Rāmānuja Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh, that was the <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Jeer Swami. Shriman Narayana Jeer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That's not a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Sahasra-Bhāgavata.</span> They had one thousand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that Donghari Maharaja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That Donghari is very famous in Gujarat, so now he has mostly become famous all over India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they are booking thirty rooms in our guesthouse for ten days for the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> You've got new <span class="Italic">japa</span> beads, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> It was made in Honolulu. In Honolulu <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plants are very luxurious. Hyderabad local people, they are not sympathetic with our temple? Huh? Not sympathetic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But when their caste guru comes they may come out, because that's a big thing. Narayana Jeer, Rāmānuja-sampradāya, so Rāmānujas have to pay their respects to their own <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> The temple is being built. And the location of Hyderabad is such that there are so many guesthouses, because it's near the station, Nampally Station. There are many guesthouses. So from all over India people who stop in Hyderabad, they come to the temple. So from all over Andhra we got invitations from people who had come to the temple. (plane going over)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guesthouse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There's the Vṛndāvana Hotel, and that Ashoka?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Annapurna...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Annapurna Hotel, so many guesthouses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They visit our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> All those <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> that came for the <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> and everybody, after the <span class="Italic">yajña</span> ended at about six-thirty, they immediately came to the temple, our temple, afterwards. Everybody knew. We distributed thousands of books there. It was very good book distribution. We sold in one day, you know, we were selling two thousand rupees a day worth of books. Everybody that came there was very pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We took advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless one is pious how he can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> Yes, we went there every day and we had all day book distribution and <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Actually some of the Marwaris were good friends of ours, so we wanted to get..., they announced that we were there and we were selling books over the loudspeaker system. Very good. They gave us..., we had a good place for book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Bombay also Shrimati Morarji had a big program in her house recently. There were huge crowds and our devotees went there to distribute books afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They didn't like it, though. Ghaja, Ghaja came, from Śrī Nāthajī, has come to her house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the idea, Ghaja(?) Due to her influence people came. Not for the Ghaja(?). She is influential and something is being done, everyone knows that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In Bangalore we went to another Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sannyāsī's āśrama,</span> and he invited us to see an initiation, and they burned the <span class="Italic">śaṅkha-cakra</span> on the shoulders, by fire, branded. That means they're initiated.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you have got to look after that <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> or what the <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña</span> will be happy there to live there? I think I am not wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are right. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra</span> is changeable. <span class="Italic">Kṣetrajña </span>is permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Permanent, but changing <span class="Italic">kṣetra</span> may be kept till the <span class="Italic">kṣetrajña</span> is there, presiding over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> However you may try, <span class="Italic">antavanta ime dehāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Antavanta ime dehāḥ,</span> that is right, but the <span class="Italic">anta</span> may not be got too quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> What is this (Hindi)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sagrada(?)</span> is meant for only cough. (Hindi) Is Āyur-Vedic, very good medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Where can we get some?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You can grow them here in this garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Where can I buy it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You can buy it from the market, <span class="Italic">serabasagra.(?)</span> Syrup, it is in the form of paste. Leaves are also paste make a decoction out of it. <span class="Italic">Asaka(?)</span> is recognized by the Western medicine also. Americans are importing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was introduced by Dr. Bose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bose, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He introduced so many Indian drugs in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have in Bengal this Standard Pharmaceuticals of Bengal, been able to isolate penicillin from cow dung, and they have a big plant in Calcutta producing penicillin from cow dung. It's stated, you know, how cow dung was considered sacred. Perhaps we did not know that, but by experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before this, one Monmohan Gosh, Dr. Monmohan Gosh, he was pathologist in medical college. He proved the antiseptic properties of <span class="Italic">gobara.</span> He was Dr. Gosh's friend. So he was working in his laboratory also. I know. Long ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And in <span class="Italic">gomūtra,</span> sir, there are so many hormones coming, and a big sample of hormones which can be resynthesized as human hormones. That is why <span class="Italic">gomūtra</span> is being drunk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gomūtra</span> is good medicine for liver disease. If you drink urine of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, it is proved scientifically so many hormones and by-products and hormones which can be resynthesized into human hormones, modern science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, <span class="Italic">gomūtra</span> is considered sacred by we people that we put a drop in the newly born child's mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pañca-gavya, gomūtra</span> is one of the parts. <span class="Italic">Pañca-gavya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Milk and honey. Five ingredients, <span class="Italic">gomūtra</span> is one of the five things. Honey, milk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is <span class="Italic">pañca-amṛta. Pañca-gavya</span> a little different. <span class="Italic">Gobara,</span> urine, milk, yogurt, and ghee. This is <span class="Italic">pañca-gavya,</span> pertaining to the cow. And that honey, that is <span class="Italic">pañca-amṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, I have a question. Can I ask you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now then, Arjuna was so advised that he should fight out. So in that case, I mean we all consider he was right to follow Kṛṣṇa advice? Then if a man is overtaken by disease and if he fights out that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't say that, that he should not fight. It is my personal... Not that one should not take care of the body or one should not eat medicine, that is not. I like this, let me do without medicine. That is my personal... It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is medicine? Any herb is a medicine, even food is a medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, I don't decry medicine. That is not my business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, I don't say decry. But you don't want to take advantage of medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medicine. Just like a type of <span class="Italic">vairāgya,</span> sometimes they do not eat. That does not mean eating is forbidden. It is not. It is my personal, I am trying to avoid, that's all. There was a big friend of W. C. Bannerji. You have heard the name W. C. Bannerji? He was one of the three inaugurators of Congress in the beginning. No, that Bannerji, Surendranatha Bannerji, he came later. Almost contemporary. But the Congress was started by I think, yes, W. C. Bannerji. W. C. Bannerji was a big barrister. So he had his friends, contemporary. So he was also <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So when... He was taking daily his bath in the Ganges, and if he was diseased, was drinking Ganges water. So he became seriously sick. So this W. C. Bannerji, he was a big man. So he asked his permission to bring some doctor. "You'll die in this way."(?) So he persisted, "No, I shall simply drink this Ganges water." So it is not that medical science is in defeated position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He just died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">Brahmacaryeṇa. Tapasya,</span> one of the items is <span class="Italic">anāhāra. Anāhāra.</span> As far as possible not to eat. That is one of the items of <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> You know this <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> Vinoba Bhave, he's going on a fast until death starting in September to end cow slaughter in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole Europe, there is no cloud, no rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There's lot of rain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fortunate <span class="Italic">vṛṣṭi.</span> Still India fortunate. I'm coming from London, Paris, and Tehran. All fields yellow. And Europe, so much scorching heat and sunshine, I never seen. Especially in London. This time I saw everything has become yellow. Greenness gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The non-monsoon countries can produce more food than the monsoon countries. The monsoon comes only three months in a year. Those people get rain all year 'round, they can grow better crops. This is how so many parts of North America and Europe, they can have sufficient crops all the year. We can't have it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is scarcity of water also. They are killing the animal premature. They cannot do it. It has come to this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) in favor of vegetarians. We are fools raising fodder and this thing and again raising animals on that and feeding on that. Why can't we directly feed on poor animals? I think the human race will survive more that way than by eating animals, but economically it is more sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is recommended, <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa never said <span class="Italic">māṁsād bhavanti bhūtāni.</span> Kṛṣṇa never said. This is artificial. In the lower stage of human civilization when they cannot produce food they do not know how to do it, so the animals are killed. What can they do? But actual food is <span class="Italic">anna,</span> food grains. Even for the animals. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni. Yajñād bhavati bhū</span>... So there is no <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> So this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> is the only <span class="Italic">yajña</span> in Kali-yuga. So if they perform, everything is all right. There will be cloud, there will be rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña karma samudbhava.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the Kali-yuga, the other <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> are not possible. First of all, there is no <span class="Italic">yājñika-brāhmaṇa</span> and paraphernalia, so many things. Perhaps if we perform <span class="Italic">yajña</span> and pour <span class="Italic">ghee</span> on it, immediately government arrest. <span class="Italic">Ghee</span> can be produced immense. I have studied. Immensely, you can produce, by keeping cows. Kṛṣṇa has recommended, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya. Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya.</span> The <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya</span> is essential. It is not that animal slaughter stopping, no. Kṛṣṇa could have said <span class="Italic">paśu-rakṣya.</span> No, Kṛṣṇa has not said. <span class="Italic">Go-rakṣya.</span> Those who are animal eaters, they can indulge in eating other insignificant animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya</span> must be the backbone of the economy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, health, brain, everything. Milk is miracle food. And we are practically experiencing in our farms that if the cows are protected nicely, they can supply immense milk. We are getting in our farms, extra milk. Everyone is eating so many preparations, <span class="Italic">sandeśa, rasagullā, rābrī.</span> They are surprised. In their history they have not eaten all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are eating the milk-producing animal so milk will not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they advertise milk is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These Europeans, Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Don't eat milk." Do they not? And they cannot drink also. In Bengal there is a proverb, <span class="Italic">kule pete ghiya(?) (indistinct).</span> If you supply preparation made of <span class="Italic">ghee</span> to the dog, he cannot digest it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (quotes proverb in Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha! They cannot digest factually. They get, what is called? That disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Jaundice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jaundice. They cannot eat much milk product.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir. Cow is the biggest factory to produce protein, first-class proteins for human beings. Instead of taking advantage of the products of the factory, they eat out the factory itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we see practically in our farm the cows give more milk than other farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The satisfaction of the animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very satisfied. You have been in New Vrindaban with me? No, you were not. So the cows are so happy that... Just like in India. They are walking here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't do anything. Now they have, they have (Hindi), brought some crossing and each cow, Jersey cows and Indian cows, they have crossed and they are producing more than thirty, forty liters of milk every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One liter means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Two pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have got cows, they are supplying more than hundred pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> This cost is three thousand rupees, one cow. Four thousand. (Hindi) pure cows five thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have brought some Holland bulls and Jersey cows and then Indian bulls, and brought some genetic researchers brought out a new hybrid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> It is very good cow, very good. Giving thirty to forty liters per day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Those cows we have in the Pennsylvania farm, the two best ones, they're the two best pedigree cows in the whole of America. They have their pedigree traced back two hundred and fifty years to when the first cows came to America. Purebreds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our Philadelphia farm we are selling fifteen hundred dollars extra milk. Fifteen hundred dollars per month. So if cow is properly protected, it can supply immense milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was Mr. Nehru, he said that we cannot prohibit cow slaughter. Therefore he made so many wrong things. [break] (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> We are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are praying to end rebirths by <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> and so there is no question of rebirth if we do it sincerely, and it is for the <span class="Italic">parama-bhakta...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti... [Bg. </span>4.9].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām eti so'rjuna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is perfect. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paramaṁ gataḥ.</span> That is the highest. Why these people, our own people, in spite of possessing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we are so rascals, we are not taking that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think the degeneration of this country are from the foreign people, foreign domination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, it was their propaganda, Macauley's, that "If you keep Indians as Indians, you'll never be able to rule over them." So British policy was to make propaganda so that "everything Indian is bad."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think Max Mueller (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was necessary for them to Anglicize the Indians to rule over them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our differential, or (Hindi) has created all this rot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not our, it is human society's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) We allowed everyone to be here unawares. If public corporation, trading company, becomes the ruler of this country, I don't understand how it could be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we have no, that <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇa</span> system. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have given up Kṛṣṇa's instruction, now you have to suffer. You do not train <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> So anyone who is in power, he is good. That is Kali-yuga. Kali-yuga means anyone gets vote, he's in power. They can misuse the power. There is no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think that is a wrong system (much airplane noise-indistinct) this open Democracy is not a (indistinct) by consensus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Now, either democracy or monarchy, the population is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So either you make it democracy or any "crazy," <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> will be on the power. So they can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> sir, the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> will rule according to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> Who is going to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>? We are inviting everyone, "Come here, become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>." Who is interested? He'll go to the factory. Instead of becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> he'll be hammerman. In America no students are coming to the philosophical class or higher mathematics class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mathematics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Higher studies, nobody comes. Only technology. The higher class, higher studies class, they are being closed. The professors are getting no job. We have a friend, Dr. Henderson, he is a doctor in higher mathematics, he is not getting job. No students, nobody is interested in higher... Similarly, many other things, and literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Here also the same thing, nobody. And Sanskrit practically nil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And philosophy class, closed. Here I think also. Nobody... They think "What is the use of speculation?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> At Kurukṣetra, one Sanskrit university they are planning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic university. So that is our plan. We have asked government to give us land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> We had a big article in the <span class="Italic">Times of India</span> about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Provided government gives us land. [break] ...in Bombay. (Hindi) Palm trees, within the palm trees, such buildings will not have this advantage. I think in this quarter our, this land is the best. This Juhu and Birawallah(?) Scheme, this land is the best. Twenty-thousand square yards full of palm trees, and we have made this garden. This advantage is not available by everyone. They divided the property, this side five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and the vacant side nine <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Fourteen. So anyway, we took both the sides. Taking this side, five <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> now this one building is worth five <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> There are six buildings. Very high. And we have got six buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I put up a foundation of my new house here, it has cost me only foundation sixty thousand. Only twenty-one square feet. Twenty-one hundred square feet. Foundation has cost (indistinct).</div>
