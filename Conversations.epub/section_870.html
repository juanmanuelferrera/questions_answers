<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from the ground. So the tree is the son, and the earth is the mother. So what is the wrong argument there? We have got experience that a child is coming from the womb of the mother. So why we should suggest a nonsense creation, that there was a chunk and there was a creation? What is this? Talk on this point. Where is your experience that all of a sudden a chunk dropped and there was creation? We have got experience that creation is there. Mother is there, and a child is coming. This is the creation. So wherefrom this idea comes, that without father and mother, creation is possible? What is his argument? He is great scientist. Let him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Chief rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say that nature takes care of it all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What? Then why nature did not take care of you? (laughter) Therefore you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? The trees, they produce seeds, and the seed drops on the ground, and than another tree comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's no father. Simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no father. That I understand. But the tree is coming from the earth. So that is in anywhere. Just like the father gives the seed in the womb of the mother, and she produces the body and it comes out. The seed is coming from the father. And that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bījo'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> The seed comes from the father, that you cannot deny. Mother, without seed, cannot be pregnant and cannot give child. That is our experience. Nature is mother, and the seed is given by the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In science, the biologists teach that there are small animals, very small, called amoebas. And when they reproduce, they simply divide themselves into two; there is no sex, there is no father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So two or three or four or five coming from the life. The amoeba is a life. Not that from any stone it is coming. The life is coming from life. But in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Previously the scientists used to say that they would put dirty laundry and rotten garbage in a box. Then a few weeks later they would find rats. So they said that rats are made from garbage. So then everyone-this was presented as a very laughable theory. And then the next theory that was presented as the actual one was that life came from chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, life comes from rats (laughs). Every year, they are changing their theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, their philosophy came from rats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? What is that philosophy? Rat philosophy? This is called <span class="Italic">vṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya</span> in Sanskrit. The scorpion is coming from the stock of rice. Actually, the scorpions they lay egg within the stock of rice, and by fermentation the eggs become scorpion and come out. Not that the rice is producing scorpion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The scientists know about that, and they say yes, that is very laughable, primitive. But their new theory is simply that life comes from chemicals. So it is actually the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, because life is also chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the fact is that they cannot even manufacture a tiny seed which will fructify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let them manufacture a seed. From that seed a big tree will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Some devotees are saying that cockroaches are coming from the vapors of impure things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they come. That is called <span class="Italic">sveda-ja.</span> Just like from perspiration, bugs are coming out. <span class="Italic">Sveda-ja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So isn't that life coming from matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not matter. From matter is not coming, but they are taking birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the atmosphere that they get born into.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So are they coming from eggs, or how are they coming? Just the soul enters the dirt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like it is a suitable circumstance from which the living entity makes his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But how has the cockroach been formed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like embryo. The living entity comes of the two secretions of father and mother emulsified. It creates a situation so that he can stay there and develop a body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But it requires some emanation from a cockroach body in order to create another cockroach body. So how can a cockroach body be created from vapors without contact of another cockroach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Vapor does not create. The individual soul comes there according to his <span class="Italic">karma</span> and, in that condition, he develops his body. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So the seed of.... The soul is within the vapor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The seed, when it is put into the earth, a situation is created so the soul can develop into a tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> But how would the soul develop a particular body...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Yamarāja is.... We are reading the Yamarāja incident(?). That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like how can a living entity take birth in the fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The argument is that how can an entity take birth in perspiration? His question. So how can a living entity take birth in the fire? Mostly our experience is that entities are taking birth from the earth, but according to the understanding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how the fishes are born in the water? How the other living entities, they remain in the air? Or without air? There are five elements: earth, water, fire, air.... Anywhere, the living entities can take birth. <span class="Italic">Sarva-ga. Sthāṇur sarva-gataḥ acalo 'yam.</span> You read all these words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sarva-ga.</span> From anywhere, he can take birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Do the living entities who are born from perspiration require a mother and father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. There is mother. That perspiration is mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So the reason why they get a particular body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the father is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So they are just getting a particular body just due to Yamarāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, according to the decision of the Yamarāja, he has to get a particular type of body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The scientists don't know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very confusing, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Confusing must be. How you can understand the subtle laws of God? You have dull brain, with cow dung. (laughs) You cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arcita:</span> So according to the Christians, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Jesus Christ was born without contact of any material father. He was divinely placed in the womb of Mary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Divinely placed by the Father is God. That's all. You cannot deny the fact. And he claims: "I am son of God." Then, what is the argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arcita:</span> Is there any such experience in the Vedic literatures, Śrīla Prabhupāda? An example we can cite also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Vedic literature, apart from. Your argument, that without father, how it is without father? Without father, there is no question of birth; without mother, there is no question of birth. Our point is that without father there is no creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda, when a living entity is in an animal body, and when he quits his body, there's no <span class="Italic">karma,</span> he's just automatically promoted to a higher body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal life means there is no sin. It is promotion. Because they are animal, their consciousness is not developed. Just like a child-a child, if he steals, that is not sin. He will not be criminally charged. He is child. A dog goes left to the right or right to the.... He is not criminal. But if you do, you are criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So Yamarāja does not direct the movements of the living entities as they are going automatically from animal body to higher body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> An animal is not jurisdiction of Yamarāja. The man is in the jurisdiction of.... Just like law is meant for man, not for the cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So what determines the different varieties of dogs and cats if they are just automatically being...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not automatically. You are man. If you develop a dog's mentality, the Yamarāja puts you in the dog's body. And then you again develop, come to the man's body. That means your term of imprisonment finished. You become again man. Now again decide. And again if you become a dog's mentality, again go. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The different varieties of suffering within the animal species are due to the different varieties of sinful activities in the human life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they, then they automatically come. Just as your term of imprisonment, by day's gone, it is finished, again you are free. Similarly, by natural development from dogs or cockroaches or from this or that, there is a process of development. You come to the human form of body. Then again you decide whether you go down or you go back to home, back to Godhead. That is your choice. If you want to go down, go again. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> come here. So make your choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So the living entity who is in the lower body like insects or plants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will come automatically to the human form of body, by promotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And he passes through all the species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So he has no desire to fly, but still he passes through bird species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just like child is taken care of. Child does not know what he is doing, but the father, mother, taking care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's taken through stages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So mother nature takes care to bring him again to the grown-up youthful life. Now you make your decision. So, if you don't make your decision, the knowledge is there, the books are there, if you don't make your decision, still you want to remain as cats and dogs, again begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Do most humans go down to the animal species again after human life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do most human beings fall down into the animal species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. He can become a stool worm. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the value for the living entity to automatically pass through all these different species? Does he get any knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To, to finish his life of imprisonment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> How is it benefiting him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's corrected. Benefit is he's corrected. After undergoing so many species of life, he is corrected and again he is brought to the human form of life, civilized form of life. Let him make his choice. If he again makes his choice, go down to become a stool worm. Go! That is nature's.... <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi-guṇa,</span> according to qualities he has taken. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā: [Bg. </span>3.27] the rascal, being proud, "Now I have got this life, civilized life. I can do whatever I like to. Ah, there is no God." Then God comes as death and puts you again to become a worm in stool. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the Seventh Canto you mention that there are certain species of human life for whom certain sinful activities they don't receive any reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, uncivilized, they are like animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> So they can perform, like, let's say for example, intoxication or meat-eating, and they won't receive any sinful reaction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, oh, yes. No. Because they are uncivilized. And you claim to be civilized and you are killing animals? Must be responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arcita:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, those who come up from the animal species, do they automatically get a chance to contact Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or do they, might be born in low family, or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they get.... Just like we are opening centers, we are giving chance to everyone. If he takes opportunity, he can become realized.(indistinct) <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the duty of devotees, to raise everyone to the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But if one is unfortunate, he does not take the advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a question of fortune then, in the human form, to get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Obstinacy. If you take the worm from the stool, aside, it will go again to the stool. You see? Again it will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's still, within all the different species, there are still different varieties. What accounts for all these varieties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Varieties of the body, according to the mentality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> According to <span class="Italic">karma</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, according to karma at the time of death, mind is saturated in that way, and he gets a body, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> And then, after, say if a human being falls down into the animal species, after that, does he go through each and every one of these species successively? Even there are different types of dogs, he becomes each different type of dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, oh, yes. That is Darwin's gradual evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Except this is evolution of consciousness, growing bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Darwin has captured that portion, how the body is changing one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> So, for somebody who is now a disciple of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, are we to understand if he is not born in a family of devotees and if he is not born in an aristocratic family, that he was not a yogi in his past life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Past life, they had some good deeds. Therefore they have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. It is called <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti.</span> Besides that, whatever he may be in the past life, the movement is there, it is open for everyone. Everyone can come and take advantage, despite whatever he did in his past life. It doesn't matter. If he comes and if he is fortunate, if he chants, then he becomes advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> This is Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's special mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were explaining to the reporter yesterday that the difference between the animal and the human is that the animal cannot think of God; he has no religion. So, when the living entity is passing through these different species, he doesn't have sufficient knowledge of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No knowledge. That is animal. That is animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then how is he benefited? You explained it, as he is being promoted he is being corrected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Corrected, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But if he cannot understand God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no need of.... Different stages of body.... Just like you are going up one step, another step, another step. There is no need of going, "What is this?" But you are going up, step by step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you explain that one takes a specific birth due to a specific degree of lust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, mental situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you once said that if someone is not attracted to chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that he is being punished by Yamarāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Āpana karama bhuñjāye śamana kahaye locana dāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dānavīr:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes when we're preaching to people that we don't eat meat, fish or egg, they say,"Why not eggs? They're not actually living. It's just a, it hasn't been fertilized."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that's a rascal. You explain it, explain to him that why they cannot make an egg by chemical composition and give for fermentation and a chicken may come. Why do they not do that? Why they are taking eggs from hens? Why do they not chemically manufacture egg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> Must have life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. If that is a fact, that there is no life, then you prepare egg. What is there? Some white chemicals. A little yellow. You can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like abortion. They have a process to take the egg from the hen, and they make sure that the egg will not grow into a chicken. It is like an abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. The life is there. You make some arrangement that it will not take part. That is another thing. If it is a fact that the egg is not life, then why you rascal do not manufacture a chemical egg and get a chicken? Why you rascal talking nonsense? That is our challenge. We say "rascals" not without consideration, because actually they talk like nonsense. Rascals. They cannot do, and still they'll insist they will do. That is rascal. Is it all right? (laughs) South, South America, er, South Africa, there are so many factories of begetting chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Rainbow Chicken Factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the chicken factory, but they're taking the eggs from chicken. Why not manufacture small egg and give to the fermentation and come? There is no question of killing animals. Why they are taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say God has provided it for us for food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then you become a dog. God has provided you a dog's body. Take advantage of it and bark. (laughter) Protest. "Why You have made me? Why You are doing?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> When I was in the hospital, right next to me there was one yogi, and a girl yogi came to instruct him every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes. (laughter) One of her instructions was, the first instruction was that you can do anything you want. You just cannot be attached to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then suffer. Why you have come to hospital? If you have become attached to the suffering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Good morning!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good morning. Thank you, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Oh, isn't that nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> So the whole time he was in the hospital, all he talked about was how much he was suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't be attached. (laughs) Rascal. Don't be attached. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But the.... Certain psychologists are very, very interested in trying to put a person under hypnosis, and then he can talk about experiences he has had in his past lives. They are very eager to have a person under a certain condition where he will remember experiences from his past life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why the psychiatrist does not remember? Why he does not remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that only certain people have the ability to remember.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can remember, but not these rascals' mechanical process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say they take him into the subconscious and they extract thoughts from the subconscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say certain people can be done. That means it is nonsense. If it is a fact, if it is a process, then everyone can remember. Why certain? That is their jugglery of words. Cheating.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as they say "certain people," that is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Actually, they say that potentially everyone has these powers, but some are more developed than others. Also the powers to understand each other's thoughts. (someone passes with a portable radio hearing a news broadcast)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated, <span class="Italic">nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇuḥ.</span> So <span class="Italic">sarva-gataḥ,</span> meaning the living entity is all-pervading, this is nominative singular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all-pervading, everyone can go, <span class="Italic">gataḥ,</span> one who can go anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> Oh, so that's the understanding, because the impersonalists' understanding, they could say that the living entity is actually God by saying that he is all-pervading, <span class="Italic">sarva-gataḥ.</span> They could interpret it in this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you ask him, you are <span class="Italic">sarva-gataḥ</span>? If you are intelligent you should have asked him, are you <span class="Italic">sarva-gataḥ</span>? What he'll answer?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are not liberated, why you are talking nonsense? Then you are a nonsense. You are not liberated, you cannot talk correct things. Don't talk. If you are not liberated, whatever you are talking, you are nonsense. So why you are misleading people? First of all, be liberated, then talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> What is the position of Dhruva Mahārāja, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? He was a devotee, that's all. He never said that "I am God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes devotees argue that "Dhruva Mahārāja, he had a material desire, and still he became perfect. So I can keep my material desires."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when he gave up material desires, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varān na yāce,</span> "I don't want anything," then he became liberated. So long he had material desires, he was not liberated. When he refused to possess anything material, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varān na yāce,</span> then he became liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But say, like Dakṣa, he saw Lord Viṣṇu and he had a desire for sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dakṣa. So he was still having sex desire, but he saw Lord Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So then someone could argue, use that as an argument for returning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seeing Viṣṇu is not liberation. Just like when Kṛṣṇa was present, so many people saw Him. Does it mean that everyone became liberated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a question of understanding His position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just like now many people are seeing you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, but only a few are getting the benefit. Everyone is getting benefited in some way, but only a few are understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from me, even one sees Kṛṣṇa.... There were so many. But it is said that in the battlefield, everyone who died seeing Kṛṣṇa, he got liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> You once said if someone sees <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and wonders "Who are those people?" then they are ten times more advanced than the greatest scientist.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> By the mercy of Supersoul, he can be present in many places at once?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By the grace of Kṛṣṇa, a devotee can become anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> So in other words that means the pure devotees can be omniscient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. God is omniscient, so a pure devotee can become omniscient by the grace of God.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhusūdana:</span> In other words, sometimes it says Kṛṣṇa comes Himself, and actually the meaning is that He comes as His incarnation like Lord Buddha, but the verse seems to say that it's the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, and without your purport it's not possible..., it's almost left so that you can be fooled, as if it's a covering, a special covering so that nondevotees cannot understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Supreme Personality cannot come? It is said there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhusūdana:</span> No, it says He comes in the form of Lord Buddha, but I remember it was a great misunderstanding that Buddha was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can come in any form He likes, not particularly as Lord Buddha. He's coming as fish, He's coming as tortoise, He's coming as boar, so why as Lord Buddha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhusūdana:</span> But you explain that Lord Buddha is not <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva,</span> but that He is <span class="Italic">śakty-āveśa-avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhusūdana:</span> But the verse says the Supreme Lord will come Himself, so one tends to think, well, Lord Buddha is the Supreme Lord Himself, but actually without your purport we wouldn't understand that He's <span class="Italic">śakty-āveśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the <span class="Italic">śakti</span> is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Śakti-śaktimator abhedaḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">śakti,</span> energy, and the energetic, they're identical.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's many living entities within the body. Just like there's tiny germs, worms, all kinds of living beings.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Arcita:</span> Is it the same in the spiritual body? Is it the same in the spiritual body? Is the spiritual body actually composed of many living entities, but there's one living entity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The spiritual body is identical with the soul. Here in the material world there is duality, inferior and superior. In the spiritual world everything is of a superior nature. There is no duality. There's no material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Petrol smelling everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's from these automobiles, the exhaust.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Some have become extinct.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No longer on this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (too much noise) Not necessarily. They are within the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, other animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What other animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Those gigantic, they called them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Brontasaurus.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tetrasaurus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another imagination. These are actual facts.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They just made up different compositions of bones and then drew some outlines on them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But you said in Hawaii though that there are some animals that are as big as skyscrapers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, these are birds. It is far from this earth though. They travel from one planet to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So these bones that they have found of these gigantic animals, they were all living underneath the water.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not on the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. But the list is there: <span class="Italic">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi.</span> There are 900,000 different forms, and how many we have seen? There is information in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We've seen a few hundred at most.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. (laughs) That is also doubtful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Kṛṣṇa incarnates into every species of life. He can appear in any form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise, why the form came? <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> If we have to accept this <span class="Italic">sūtra,</span> that everything emanates from Him, so unless Kṛṣṇa has got such similar form...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's one argument that always defeats the impersonalists. They can't explain how forms have come from something without form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impersonalists are neophytes. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, "With poor fund of knowledge." Their knowledge is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yesterday you were telling a reporter that it is not possible for modern man to travel to the moon, but in your Second Canto you describe that in a previous age of Kali the men had created mechanical means for going to other planets, and they were creating havoc all over the universe, and Lord Buddha appeared to stop their nonsense.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got our own argument, that the other planet is as good as this planet. If this planet is full of life, why the other not? Analogy. Analogy is also another science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes, you write in the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book that the demigods can come to this planet invisible.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not? Some men arguing that.... Because he did not see, it does not mean there is no life. That they cannot say. Just like in the water we don't see. Superficially.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If they take a camera over the water, they won't see any life.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...with their camera.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Even over the earth, you can't see any life. They took pictures of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that is their defect, that their eyes are defective. They cannot go there. That they will not accept. The camera which they manufactured, that is also defective. Because you have manufactured it. You are defective. Your senses are defective. Therefore, in the Vedic literature: "Don't try to see with your eyes, but try to see by ear, <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> " <span class="Italic">Śāstra-cakṣuṣā.</span> You should accept as your eyes the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> Not your so-called eyes.
