<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 9, 1974, Māyāpura</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's situated as Paramātmā, <span class="Italic">antaryāmī,</span> everywhere, <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stham,</span> within the universe as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, within the heart of everyone, and even within the atom. Then how we can walk? Kṛṣṇa is within the atom. How we can walk? If somebody says, "How we are walking on the road?" Because in the atom there is God. Within... <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In everywhere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this, this is combination of <span class="Italic">paramāṇu,</span> atom. So how we can walk? People may question like that, that "In, within the <span class="Italic">paramāṇu,</span> there is Kṛṣṇa. How we are walking on this road?" So this question you should all understand very... You know that upon the <span class="Italic">mandira,</span> we do not stay. Just like our Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">mandira</span> is being constructed. There is no residential quarter upon the <span class="Italic">mandira.</span> Similarly, when the <span class="Italic">mandira</span> will be constructed, we are not so fool that we'll show, we'll go and stay upon the <span class="Italic">mandira.</span> But <span class="Italic">mandira</span> is not constructed yet. So what shall we do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Worship should go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore we have temporary situated <span class="Italic">mandira</span> in the same building. We cannot stop our worship. That is not possible. Because one cannot go upon the <span class="Italic">mandira,</span> because the Lord is now being worshiped within the residence, it does not mean we can stop His worship. Worship must continue in any condition, <span class="Italic">apratihatā,</span> without being impeded by any rules and regulations. This is called <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga. Vidhi-mārga,</span> and there is <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga. Vidhi-mārga</span> means under rules and regulations, and <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> means out of love. That is another thing. There is another instance. Govinda was personal servant of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So after His dinner, Govinda used to give Him massage on the leg. So one day Caitanya Mahāprabhu fell down on the ground and began to sleep on the door. So Govinda was to give massage to His leg. So he crossed Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and began to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not walk. Giving massage. So He was sleeping. So at two or three o'clock when Caitanya, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu became awake: "Govinda, you are sitting here. You have not taken your dinner?" "No, sir." "Why?" "Now, how could I cross you and take my dinner?" "Then how you came?" "No, that is for Your massaging. (laughter) But I cannot cross You for my dinner."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. "For You I can cross."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For You, I can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For You...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For Your service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For your service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But for my sense gratification, I cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very good answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In a, in the Western countries, I had to sometimes do something which I should not have done. But I've done it to bring so many souls to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The preaching necessitates that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because if there is no other alternative, what can I do? In the beginning I had no disciples. So I was cooking myself. So one gentleman, he... Later on, he became my disciple. He gave me some place. I was cooking. And in the refrigerator, I saw there was meat. (laughs) So I asked: "What is this?" He said, "It is for cats. I don't take meat." "All right. (laughter) I'll do (?)." So of course, I stayed there for three, four days. And if I cry, "Oh, I have violated my rules and regulations..." Rules and regulations can be violated when there is urgent necessity of service, not whimsically or for one's sense gratification. And that is, of course, in our present..., with the permission of the spiritual master, not one should think, "Oh, I have become so much great devotee, I can violate all the rules and regulations." No, you cannot. If there is need of violating rules and regulations, you must take permission. Now we have no temple. Under the circumstances, we are doing that. So you construct the temple as soon as possible so that people may not criticize you. [break] ...for all <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotees, you should begin preaching amongst the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> It is not forbidden for the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> to preach. Because preaching is required everywhere. Arjuna was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> So <span class="Italic">yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> One must know the science of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can become preacher.</div>
<div class="Verse">kibā vipra kibā nyāsī śūdra kene naya<br class="calibre2"/>yei kṛṣṇa-tattva-vettā sei guru haya<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 8.128]</div>
<div class="Verse">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/>āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is preaching. It doesn't matter whether one is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> Or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It doesn't matter. If one knows the science of Kṛṣṇa then he can become guru. And He said, "By My order, you become guru and deliver your country." <span class="Italic">Ei deśa. Ei deśa</span> means "your country." "So what is to be done?" "Now, just whomever you meet, you instruct him about the instruction given by Kṛṣṇa." [break] ...seeing that "Why our, you are living on the top of the temple?" You inform them that, "You have not seen yet temple. It is not temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It is temporary...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have yet to see what is temple. "Temple will be constructed. This is not temple." I wanted to stay in the <span class="Italic">dharmaśālā</span> of Tīrtha Mahārāja, to construct the temple. I requested him that "Some of my men will stay in the <span class="Italic">dharmaśālā.</span>" He refused. Then how can I construct temple? Therefore I have first constructed residential quarters. And unless my men live here, how can I construct temple? So this is residential quarter. This is not the temple. The temple has yet to be done. So suppose we have no regularly constructed temple, do you think we shall give up worship of the Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We must continue it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Because there is no temple... Bhavānanda, you are understanding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We can do our worship anywhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And it is said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Anywhere, in the jungle, anywhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...bhakti. Bhakti,</span> the definition of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, apratihatā. Pratihata</span> means impediment. I have seen amongst the Mohammedans. It is very good. As soon as their <span class="Italic">namaz</span> time is there, anywhere they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Anywhere, anywhere, they will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Even on road, they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> On the boat, on everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The four times, three times, <span class="Italic">namaz.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're so regulated, as soon as the time is there, anywhere, they'll worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There was big trouble about them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There was big trouble about them in London for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because they would leave their work and start praying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then the work was stopped, and later on, it was sorted out. They were allowed to do their worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> [break] ...cultured under, say, very comfortable circumstances. This has a relation to constant inquiries from public, specially young men, at the entrance of our <span class="Italic">mandira,</span> our, this building, these days. I was sort of doing, helping them for entrance and exit. In that course, many young people specially they asked, "How could people living in so much comfortable circumstances could hear and ask for <span class="Italic">bhakti."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then does it mean that those who are...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I, knew... Yes... Yes...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are in uncomfortable situation, they are big <span class="Italic">bhaktas?</span> (laughter) Can you show me that because they're in uncomfortable situation, they have become big <span class="Italic">bhakta?</span> Is that the proof? What is this land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This land we were looking at a few days ago? You suggested purchasing it for grazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is very nice. So it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so do it. [break] <span class="Italic">...bhakti's,</span> as I explained, <span class="Italic">apratihatā.</span> Any condition, <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> can be executed. The example is given: Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī and Rāmānanda Rāya. Rāmānanda Rāya was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and governor, and he was very comfortably situated. And Rūpa Gosvāmī was living underneath a tree every night. And both of them were equally... Rather, Rāmānanda Rāya was accepted in greater position than Rūpa Gosvāmī. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was in renounced order of life, but He gave even better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī. And Rāmānanda Rāya was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He was not even a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And governor, very opulent. Very comfortable situation. You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how Caitanya Mahāprabhu treated them equally or gave better position to Rāmānanda Rāya than Rūpa Gosvāmī? This question was raised-not only now-when our Guru Mahārāja started Gauḍīya Maṭha. So he was allowing the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> to live in palatial building and go in car for preaching work. So many such persons questioned, "How is that, <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> are going in car, living in palatial building?" So our Guru Mahārāja replied that "A devotee should be offered the best comfort of life. And if he would not have introduced this comfortable life, at the same time, to become pure devotee, then these devotees from Western countries will, would never come. They would never agree to sit down under the tree and, imitating Rūpa Gosvāmī... That is not possible." Do you understand or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I answered that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You answer me. I am talking with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Actually, I didn't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, in our building we have got the most comfortable situation. There is no such sanitary arrangement in any of the temples. But we are trying to give them. Because we deal, dealing in a different atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> People of the different countries can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They are not habituated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not habituated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...with this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to go on the field and pass, evacuate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...to pass their obnoxious and</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it will be a great difficulty for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...great difficulties for them. And to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must be given, as far as possible, their western type of comforts and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And they're born and brought up in this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have sacrificed so much for me. They are ready to lie down under the tree. But it is my duty to see they are, as far as possible, they're comfortably situated. That is my duty. They can agree to live in any condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Gargamuni said me like this one day, and myself and one of the devotees went to draw the ration from the river in the distance, two miles off. And the devotee's saying, "We'll go by the car." And "Let us go by the rickshaw."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they do like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I like to save the paths(?) of the temple. And that devotee's not... Up till devotee, but he was a worker, his whole time living in the temple. And I asked Gargamuni, "Your devotee is saying, 'We'll go by car. It is expensive. Because we are collecting money from the different peoples and from the public. And we must not use our money in this way.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> For Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> ...who are very much attracted to living in Māyāpura, residing in Māyāpura, after perfecting their lives, do they sometimes join Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu's <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement in Goloka Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let me... [break] Those who are living in Māyāpura, they have already joined.</div>

There is no question of liberation for him, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.</span> He's already in the Brahman platform.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is just to give His personal example that a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should not be very much intimately mixing with rich men. That is by His personal example. He was a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He refused to see a king because a king is supposed to be always busy in material affairs. So if... For the general people aspiring to go back to home, back to Godhead, for them, to mix with the materialistic persons is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Viṣayiṇāṁ sandarśanam atha yoṣitāṁ ca</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 11.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">viṣayī,</span> simply engaged in sense gratification, and <span class="Italic">yoṣitām...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Many religious institutions, they welcome the rich peoples. Those who are coming by cars, and those who are coming gorgeously, and they are donating much to the institutions, they are welcomed by the people, management of these institutions. And this is your version. It is just contradictory. I accept your version. It is quite, quite right. And I hope our institution must do not like that. This ISKCON must not do like that. The well-to-do peoples who come, they'll get more... [break] ...more receptions, more congratulations. I request it must be your direction that our institution ISKCON must not do like this. And it is your... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one, one thing is that we are not living like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was ideal <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and He was living apart from any material attachment. But we have to do preaching work. We have to construct temple, comfortable temple. So who will pay for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then your version...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have to sometimes do that. Just like that woman, that chaste woman. She served a prostitute...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> To make them correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Serve prostitute for serving her husband. That is a big story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Big story, yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to the prostitute and her pay, her fee, was <span class="Italic">lakṣa-hīra,</span> one hundred thousand pieces of diamond. You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. I know that, that story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So for the satisfaction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we sometimes do that. But we collect money from them not for our sense gratification, but constructing this temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For the general public and...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And unless we have got temple like this, nobody would come. If I sit down here, "Bhaktivedanta Swami is sitting here," nobody will come. (laughter)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is God. He can attract any man. But I am not God. I have to attract people by some opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But Prabhupāda, in the beginning, you attracted in the park everyone. When you went to America, you were chanting and attracting people just in the park. Same place. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, at that time, only Brahmānanda was attracted. (laughter) Not you. Not you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Only because he was sincere soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Brahmānanda and Acyutānanda, they first danced in my chanting in the park. The photograph was published in the Times of New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And I heard that your first devotee in America, Kīrtaniyā.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came next. Brahmānanda came first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, I came first. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You were present in that Thompkinson Square?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh before that. Yes, yes. Yes, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I asked him. And somebody, some devotee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahmānanda you are defeated. (laughter) So <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is glorious than <span class="Italic">brahma-jñāna.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And some devotee introduced me with him, that "He is the first devotee of Prabhupāda in America, in foreign."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's also a priest's son, coming from very respectable, priestly order family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Last few days, we were enjoying a good day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But there are so many disciples of one guru. Are they come all in bona fide disciplic succession?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm? Well, everyone is in a bona fide disciplic succession provided he keeps that tradition, keeps that tradition. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā.</span> One must behave that "I belong to this disciplic succession. I must keep myself fit for the post." Then it is all right. If he deviates, then he deviates the disciplic succession. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says frankly that... This is disciplic succession. <span class="Italic">Āmāra ājñāya:</span> "Just carry out My order." Then you are in disciplic succession. If you do not keep yourself in the order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, then simply by becoming disciple, you are not in the disciplic succession. This is disciplic succession. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said this clearly, <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei:</span> "Wherever you live, you become a spiritual master." How? <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128] "Whomever you meet, you only speak what Kṛṣṇa has instructed." Then you are disciplic succession. It doesn't matter what you are and where you are. It doesn't matter. This is disciplic succession. And if you think, "Now I am initiated. I am now liberated. I have no other business," then you are not in the disciplic succession. You must preach. That is disciplic succession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> This is the definition of a disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Āmāra ājñāya guru haña tāra ei deśa</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">, yāre dekha...</span> You have to... Anywhere, any friend, any businessman, "Are you Kṛṣṇa conscious? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That's all. What is the loss in that? "My dear friend, I request you to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span>" Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Even a child like Sarasvatī, she does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes? Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> She asks everybody. Every child, she will say: "Jump!" "Jump, Jump, Jump!" And she will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if he does not, she'll say: "Śyāmasundara, here is a <span class="Italic">karmī.</span>" (laughter) So they're... Our <span class="Italic">Gosāin</span> in Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, he was smoking. "Mālatī, Mālatī see this old man is smoking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Take this beedie out. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. She was telling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. "He's smoking beedie." This man became little ashamed. "Yes, my girl, I'll give it up by and by." She was surprised that a man is smoking. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break] <span class="Italic">...dṛḍha-vrata,</span> vows, very rigidly. <span class="Italic">Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> So if I'm unable, there is no need of starving. No. Because if you become diseased, then your <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> will be hampered. So you can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Or ability, inability, that depends on the person.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) [break] Adjust their cash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Cash is different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I mean to say, account computer. But they must tally with their daily balance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, they put in the suspense. When they find out this mistake, that somebody pointed out, then they adjust it. So many times it has happened. But this computer system is not hundred per cent efficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One Indian girl, Śakuntalā, went to London and America and stay on (?) these computers. She was able to work out computer, one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> She challenged. She challenged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śakuntalā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Śakuntalā, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some girl came to see me. She's little fatty, that girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I think...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> During the festival days...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> ...for the last three or four days, many people, specially young men, were asking for different sort of informatory books or leaflets in their own language. And also asking for how they can became members or more closely associated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> With more translational or a type of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So unfortunately, we haven't got any expert Bengali to do these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> In my own way, I am ready to prepare a sample of the English translation of the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Welcome. It is a great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But that must be very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, cheap. We can distribute without price. That is not the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> And also they were asking to be associated more in the facilities for life membership like that with... They feel it's within their reach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No life membership, life membership they're... Just like if somebody joins, he's more than life member. But if he does not join, then he becomes life member by paying the fees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I want to be a member, and I wish to resign from my present service. And I wish to dedicate my whole life to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your present service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> At present, I am serving in the steel plant, Hindustan Steel Industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, steel plant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And I want to, wish to dedicate my whole life to the lotus feet of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And I am a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How far you are educated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span>. As long as I will live, I will broom and clean the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. That's all right. You go on doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> OK. And then I will submit my resignation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is up to you. I cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes. And my parents are sufficient enough. They have enough land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrī-vigrahārādhana-nitya-nānā-śṛṅgāra-tan-mandira-mārjanādau **. Tan-mandira-mārjanādau.</span> That is also great service. If you guide other people, and you do yourself, just to keep the temple very neat and clean, it will be a very, very, great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Yes, yes, yes. I am ready to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, then you are welcome immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And that is my desire, all, inner desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Āpani ācari prabhu jīve śikhāilā.</span> If you show example how to keep the temple neat and clean, then these foreigners also will learn from you. [break] ...those who are earning money, they should... But we are giving them books. So our books are worth about three thousand rupees. But we are simply collecting eleven hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> All that they wanted, I understood from the talk, informatory, informations I mean, in their own dialect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, one thing is that at least in Bengal they do not require much information because this Caitanya Movement is their movement. It is simply a plea. Everyone know that Caitanya Mahāprabhu came to distribute the <span class="Italic">Hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.</span> This is the essence, and let them help, <span class="Italic">prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā,</span> by life, by money, by words. This is the movement. Why they are anxious to get information more? That is a plea. Everyone knows what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu, at least in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I tell them that when they ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I say, "Why you are asking me that? You already know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather, they are to give information. But this is a plea. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is, was not made in London. (laughter) It was spoken in India. Why they are asking? That means they have become so rascal and fool they do not know what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu? Their position is so low-graded now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They do not like to learn it. They do not like to know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> imported from London? Why do they ask like this? How much degraded they have become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And our answers must be like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As if you are... They are importing knowledge from Lenin, these rascals, and they do not know what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> How much degraded they have become. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They even go as far as to say that this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is adulterated now, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Maybe also they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Adulterated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yeah, they say so many things have been added to it. Sometimes some rascals come to criticize to that extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that addition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, when you come to, when you come to ask a specific answer, they say, "If you bring <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we'll show it to you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So bring <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> What is the addition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This was, this was pointed out by quite a few in the train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, you can ask them at that time, "Please place one book like that which is adulterated, and it is somehow or another added in it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what is their source of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> They have no, no source of... They like to</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Speculate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> They like to convey...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but they can say it is added and subtracted. They're... But they do not know what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no adulteration there. Very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you, all Indians, you have to do this. This is simply a plea to avoid. In Bengal, everyone knows Caitanya Mahāprabhu was for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But so far, most of them, perhaps, also wanted informations regarding, full informations regarding ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ISKCON. That is a short-cut of "International Society for Krishna Consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, that I know, myself. They wanted to know, in their own language, etc... And for that I meant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> ...a sort of booklet in local dialect, in the Bengali. To be more propagated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I can give you the hints. You prepare a leaflet immediately, and we publish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, yes. I, we have already prepared. Already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come. I shall give you more hints. Immediately come. I shall give you. Only need... [break] They should come forward. That is needed. Otherwise, everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I was having discussions with Pāñcajanya Prabhu regarding these things. Even to have them locally printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Anyway, we can work that out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, it's all taken care of. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Waves in the ocean. Let it, let it be stopped. Then I shall start my boat." It will never come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Then this is not my intention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will never come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> It is not my intention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Start boat immediately, in whatever condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Any circumstance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any circumstance. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We should take it very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] "First of all let us become economically fit. Then we shall consider our spiritual." This is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That will never come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the big, big leaders, they wanted to keep themselves economically fit, but when death came, they had to surrender. "Yes sir, (Bengali)"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Many leaders are economically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not... They're not leaders. I say they're rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> They do not live here, and they must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All these leaders, I must say clearly, they're all rascals, misleaders. Not only in our country, all over the world. Therefore we have started this movement, who is real leader? (end)</div>
