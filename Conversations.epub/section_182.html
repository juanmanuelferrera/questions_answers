<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not sentimental. There is no religion, and still, they are professing, "I profess this religion," Where is your religion? If actually there was religion in the human society, why there are so many problems? There should not have been so many problems. The problems are in the animal society. Why there should be problem in human society? Because they have given up the real principles. They are simply animals. Therefore there are so many problems. Actually there is no problem. Even they are not animal. Less than animal. In animal society there is no problem. There is problem, but not so acute. They are free. Just like the ducks, the pigeons, they fly from one country to another. They have no problem of immigration department, passport, or visa. They have no problem. These rascals should understand that they have created problem on account of their animalistic, less than animalistic civilization. There is no limit of sense gratification. The sense gratification, homosex, they are supporting. Just see. Just see. At least, in animal society there is no homosex. They have created homosex, and that is being passed by the priest, the religious heads. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I've heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. If you say that they are animal civilization, that is a great credit for them. It is less than animal civilization. Write all this in papers and everything, all openly. Challenge strongly. First of all, realize, then challenge. [break] <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ.</span> That is the special distinction, that their life, human life must be based on <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> religion. They have rejected <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> That is another type of frustration because the so-called leaders of religion, they could not give anything. They also exploited people under religious sentiment. Actually they could not make people religious. They did not know what is religion. And therefore people become, revolted: "What is this nonsense? They are living at our expenditure." We are real religious people. We are enlightening people about religion, life, about God. And these people they simply take money and live peacefully. And drink also. Here they drink wine. In India they drink <span class="Italic">gāñjā.</span> You have been Rādhā-Dāmodara temple? You have seen that <span class="Italic">Gosāi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Is he still there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Rādhā-Dāmodara is kind. And where this rascal will go? (laughter) After all, somehow or other, he is giving some service to Rādhā-Dāmodara, managing. <span class="Italic">Api cet sudarācāraḥ.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare. [break] ...should think that we have got to say so many things to the people. Huh? About this. So take these ingredients, assimilate them in the brain and distribute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman devotee:</span> People like it when we speak so strongly to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like. And you have got so many ingredients. So now you realize how many things you have to speak to the world, economic development, everything. We are not simply so-called religious people. We know everything in right way. Everything, what is to be... That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all round, all included.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The people who listen, they become very impressed. At many programs, the students, after I finish speaking and I answer some questions, they realize that we know something very completely. They become very interested. They come around and bring more questions. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And you will get all ideas from our books. That is Indian <span class="Italic">śaṅkha?</span> That in your hand, bangle, white bangle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Ah, elephant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is called <span class="Italic">śaṅkha.</span> From conchshell, it is made from conchshell. Where you have purchased it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> I'm afraid this is ivory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ivory? Oh. There is similar made from conchshell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Yes, I had those in Allahabad. I was going there to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Allahabad? Conch, from conchshell? It is especially used in Bengal. A woman... that is an auspicious sign that she is with her husband, to have conchshell bangle. <span class="Italic">Śaṅkha-sari.</span> A woman dressed <span class="Italic">śaṅkha</span> and sari, <span class="Italic">śaṅkha-sari.</span> They don't require any other ornament. One nice sari and <span class="Italic">śaṅkha.</span> That is Indian conception of woman having husband. That is distinction between widow and a woman having husband. Widow will not accept sari. All finished. Vedic culture, widow should finish her life after having the husband. <span class="Italic">Saha-gamana. Satī.</span> Yes. [break] ...have got enough to preach. People will like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I think so. Yes. I think we have enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll like. Enough ingredients to preach. Simply one has to become intelligent how to express. The, what is called, outlines of thought are already there. You read one line, you can speak half an hour. They are so full of meaning. Provided you can express the meanings. So we are not reading all the lines. We are going quickly from one <span class="Italic">śloka</span> to another. Otherwise, if we explained each line of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam...</span> Just like my Guru Mahārāja explained the first <span class="Italic">śloka</span> for three months in Dacca. [break] ...after this verse, he explained for three months. Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained <span class="Italic">ātmārāma-śloka</span> in sixty-four ways. That is described in <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span> Sixty-four ways. Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya explained in nine ways. He did not touch on those nine ways. Setting aside those nine ways, personally He explained in sixty-four ways. Formerly such scholars were there, such religious persons were there. Therefore people were happy. What these rascals speak? Now there is Freud's philosophy and Darwin's theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's nice because here people will listen. In India they won't listen, and in America they can't listen. They're so degraded. (end)</div>
