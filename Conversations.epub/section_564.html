<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...to solve the problem of drug and alcohol addiction and, of course, they're concerned with the causes of it and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can send all these alcohol and drug patients here and they will be cured. These boys, American and European boys, they were all addicted to alcohol, drugs. Now they have given up. Practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In what way would they cure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply I say that "If you want to be my student, then you must give up four things: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling." This is my condition. So they give up, and they become my student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do they suffer withdrawal symptoms?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says, "Do they suffer withdrawal symptoms?" Sometimes when a patient is giving up alcohol or drugs, he goes through various symptoms which are painful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That should be... But unless... Find out this, <span class="Italic">paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate. Rasa-varjaṁ raso 'py asya paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> "The embodied soul may be restricted from sense enjoyment, though the taste for sense objects remains. But, ceasing such engagements by experiencing a higher taste, he is fixed in consciousness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Purport? "Unless one is transcendentally situated, it is not possible to cease from sense enjoyment. The process of restriction from sense enjoyment by rules and regulations is something like restricting a diseased person from certain types of edibles. The patient, however, neither likes such restriction, nor loses his taste for edibles. Similarly, sense restriction by some spiritual process like <span class="Italic">aṣṭāṅga-yoga,</span> in the matter of <span class="Italic">yama, niyama, āsana, prāṇāyāma, pratyāhāra, dhāraṇā, dhyāna,</span> etc., is recommended for less intelligent persons who have no better knowledge. But one who has tasted the beauty of the Supreme Lord Kṛṣṇa in the course of his advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness no longer has a taste for dead material things. Therefore, restrictions are there for the less intelligent neophytes in the spiritual advancement of life, but such restrictions are only good if one actually has a taste for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. When one is actually Kṛṣṇa conscious, he automatically loses his taste for pale things."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if I might ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, or the Supreme Soul, and we are all individual souls. So naturally we have an awareness of our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, or God. When we say God or Kṛṣṇa, we don't mean my God or your God, but we mean God, no matter which religion we're speaking of. So all of us naturally have a capacity to love Kṛṣṇa, or God, and we can awaken this relationship with Him. And when that is awakened, then all unwanted things disappear, because everybody is actually frustrated, looking for permanent happiness in this temporary world. But when we awaken our Kṛṣṇa consciousness then all of those frustrations disappear, and so all such problems like drug addiction become unnecessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How long does this process of withdrawal take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says how long does it take to stop taking drugs by the process of Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one lives with us at least for six months, he will give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Six months. And are there cases which relapse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says, "Are there cases of..., which relapse? Persons who begin to withdraw from drugs...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe one in five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> One in five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is. Everyone is prone to fall down. But that percentage is very low, say, one in five hundred. We have got about ten thousand students all over the world. Out of them, they have fallen about ten or, say, fifteen, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You means you have ten thousand students who used to be addicted to something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Addicted to everything-illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling. And now they have given up everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And those who relapse, can they be treated again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Those who have relapsed, can they be treated again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes, that I say. Say, utmost, ten out of ten thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says, "Can they be treated again, a second time?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Even American government is pleased with this movement because they have spent so much millions of dollars for stopping LSD, and they are surprised that when the people come here, they give up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Do you teach abstinence or moderation in the use of these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we say "Stop." We don't allow even smoking and drinking tea. That is also intoxication. We are so strict. But still, they give up. None of us take tea. We eat very simple things, vegetables, wheat, rice, little milk, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Did you say you eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Wheat, wheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Wheat. Ah. Is there any reason why you don't, you prohibit people from eating meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is sinful. It is sinful. According to Vedic conception, these four things are sinful activities, four pillars. Just like four pillars, the legs of this table, similarly, illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, and gambling are the four legs of sinful life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What do you consider illicit sex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illicit sex means animal life. The marriage is in the human society, not in the dog society. So if one has illicit sex, that means he is no better than dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I don't quite understand that. Did you say that illicit means sex between people who are not married?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sex is allowed only married couple. And that is also only for begetting child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Married under what law? Under what religion? Under what religious law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span> Find out. You can come here and read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Which was that? <span class="Italic">Dharma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi. Dharma-aviruddha.</span> You know that verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is that <span class="Italic">balaṁ balavatāṁ cāham?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">balaṁ balavatāṁ cāhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kāma-rāga-vivarjitam<br class="calibre2"/>dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kāmo 'smi bharatarṣabha</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "I am the strength of the strong, devoid of passion and desire. I am sex life which is not contrary to religious principles, O Lord of the Bhāratas, Arjuna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You can follow actually? What does that exactly mean? It's a direct translation, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says, "What does that exactly mean?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explain to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, as it explains here, "The strong man's strength should be applied to protect the weak, not for personal aggression. Similarly, sex life, according to religious principles, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> should be for the propagation of children, not otherwise. The responsibility of parents is then to make their offspring Kṛṣṇa conscious."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The question was which religion, which religious principle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, he means our marriage under... We accept that marriage, sex life in marriage, is licit, not illicit. So he asked, "Under what religious principles or under which religion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any religion. Christian religion does not allow illicit sex. No adultery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Any religious principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is religious principle. In the animal kingdom there is no marriage, but in the human society-may be Christian, may be Hindu, may be Muslim-there is marriage system. That is religious system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is polygamy illicit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Not illicit. But it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Polygamy means if it is married. Just like in the Vedic society they used to marry many wives. Just like Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa had sixteen thousand wives. And He maintained them sixteen thousand palaces. And He expanded Himself into sixteen thousand Kṛṣṇas. So that is a different thing; He is God. But if you can maintain each and every wife, you can marry more than one wife. But if you are unable to maintain, that is illicit. All the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> kings, they used to marry more than one wife. Still in India, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> kings, they have more than one wife. But they maintain very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But your method of curing drug addiction has no definite practical use, surely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not practical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Not everyone who wants to stop taking drugs can spend six months in solitude or in a company like yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says he finds it not practical because not everyone who is addicted to drugs can spend six months in a temple with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are spending years. They are all European, Americans. They are not Indians. We have got here... You go to Melbourne. We have got big branch. In Sydney we have got. In Europe. They are doing that. It requires training, proper training. Then it will be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, if there is someone who wouldn't like to perhaps join this religion, but still wants to get treated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not religion. This is a culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Oh. Yes, this culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are admitting persons from various religions, various nations, various countries, and they accept this culture and they become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do they have to wear those clothes and shave their heads and chanting those things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is optional. That is also optional. That is not compulsory. But in India because the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs, sannyāsīs,</span> they dress in a particular way, they do that. But that is not compulsory. But it has got a psychological effect, because whenever we go, people chant "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" So by this dress, we give chance, the other men, to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, could you correct me if I'm wrong. We have a society called Ramakrishna Society, a society in Burma. Those people who founded this society and are practicing Kṛṣṇa culture, they don't wear those things, or they don't chant in their temple, but they do all sorts of social welfare type of thing. Is there any difference between...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramakrishna Mission is not Vedic. It is a creation of Vivekananda's concoction. It is not Vedic. Just like they created a God, Ramakrishna. So that is not a Vedic sanction, that you create any fool rascal, a god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Isn't yours a product of or derivative of Vedic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So how would you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like whatever question you are asking, we are answering from Vedic literature. We are not answering ourself. That is the difference. The evidence is from the Vedic literature. I don't say that "In my opinion it is like this." We don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'm sorry, I missed that point. Could you please explain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He said it is Vedic because the answers he is giving are not his opinion or concoction, but he is giving from the Vedic knowledge or the Vedic scriptures instead of making up his own opinion. That is the meaning of Vedic; it is based on the Vedic teachings exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But the Ramakrishna wasn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They formed their own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do you consider that this kind of practice or the practicing this kind of culture is regimentated? A person has to come in and spend sometimes in the temple, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the association, the influence of association. If you go to a drunkard association, you become a drunkard. And if you go to a saintly association, you become a saint. <span class="Italic">Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.</span> Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dhyāyato viṣayān puṁsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>saṅgas teṣūpajāyate<br class="calibre2"/>saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kāmāt krodho 'bhijāyate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one becomes lusty and if it is not fulfilled, he becomes angry. This is all psychological.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yeah, well, when a person is attached to that group in the temple, isn't this, become a lust too? You see, being influenced by the group and also attached to the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are teaching to be influenced by Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we have written fifty books like that, four hundred pages. You can show some of our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> Volume Two, Volume Four...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixty volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You seem to be placing a lot of emphasis on books. Are you following any particular path of yoga, <span class="Italic">niyama-yoga...</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> She says we place a lot of emphasis on books, and she wonders if we are following a particular path such as <span class="Italic">dhyāna-yoga</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga</span> or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are different types of yogas. And you will find</div>
<div class="Verse">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-gatenāntar-ātmanā<br class="calibre2"/>śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa me yuktatamo mataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.47]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">You have found out? Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "And of all yogis, he who always abides in Me with great faith, worshiping Me in transcendental loving service, is most intimately united with Me in yoga and is the highest of all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, doesn't it mean that someone has to worship that person to be able to attain the enlightenment or Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone is worshiping a person. Everyone is... But we have to worship the Supreme Person. That is perfect. Everyone is worshiping a person. Suppose you are employed somewhere. You have to worship your boss. Otherwise no employment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Oh, well, I consider it as a mutual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is mutual. It is mutual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's a mutual kind of support. But worshiping in a sense of religion or in a sense of a higher person, it's a different matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Worshiping means appreciating high qualities. Worshiping is not blind. If I know that you have some high qualities, I worship you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do you worship to a person or what? To his doctrines or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Worship means person. Worship does not mean imperson. Unless there is a person-to-person relationship, there is no question of worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is... This picture of Śrī Viṣṇu, it's the person who you worship or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He is the creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And, in the sense that He is called Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is His another form. Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu's another form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I see, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> What is your correlation between belief and science? You mentioned that science is involved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What do you mean by science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, the human sciences or otherwise is a study on its own. What is the relationship or the link-up between that and your faith?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The relationship-God is the creator of everything. So everything has got relationship with God. So what do you think of this science? The <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> it says, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>:</span> "Now this human life is meant for understanding the science of God." So the question is what is God? The answer is: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> "God or the Supreme Absolute Truth is that from whom everything has come." So this is our science, the origin of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, the origin of everything. But why is it necessary for man to have to discover? I mean, man discovered the cure for poliomyelitis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why man discovers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, well, I'm using it as an example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he... Just like... It is not the question of discover, but because you are existing, you must have come from a father. That is science. It is not the question of finding out a father. Without father, there is no existence of you. It is not the question of finding out a father. Father must be there. This is science. Without father, is there any existence of any man or any animal? What your science says? Is it possible that anyone is existing without a father? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I was just wondering, um, do you believe in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is there independently existing without having a father? What is that science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's not necessarily in the science itself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this is a sign, that if there is a man, he must have a father. This is science. So what is your opinion about this science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I see it as a straight, deductive logic. If there is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...son, there must be father. That is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Don't you think this kind of reasoning is a deductive logic rather than inductive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the reasoning yours, that you deny father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> The father must have a father too, mustn't he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly, there must be supreme father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, who is the supreme father's father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is enquiry, that you have got your father, your father has got father, he has got his father, he has got... Who is the supreme father? He is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Who is God's father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is His father. That is God. God is everyone's father, but He is without father. That is God. So long one has got father, he is not God. When you come to the point that here is the person who has no father-He is independent-that is God. The definition of God is given in the Vedic literature.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It becomes a belief rather than a logic now, then, for when we think about the God. You were saying everybody has father, so why God, in exception, He hasn't got a father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He is God, that He can exist without father. But you cannot exist without father. That is the difference between you and God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is God in the form of male or female or anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is male. Otherwise how He can beget? Female cannot beget without man's contact. The <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> the nature, is female, and God is male. Find out this verse,</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So material nature is the mother, and God is the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But to whom did God give the seed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> material nature. That is said here. Just like for begetting a child, both the father and mother requires. So the material nature is the mother, and God is the father. So so many forms of life are coming from the womb of material nature. This body is made of matter. This body is earth, water, air, fire, like that. This is made of... But I am the soul. That is from God. I am part and parcel of God, as soul. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ.</span> Find out.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is there an animal soul, Swami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because it is already said, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu,</span> "all forms of life." Even ant, tree, birds, plant, trees, everything. There are 8,400,000 forms of life. All of them, the soul is there. And they have got different... Just like you are differently dressed, I am differently dressed, but you are also soul, I am also soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You're really talking about the <span class="Italic">ātman</span>? Aren't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmā,</span> yes, soul is <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> And the soul of the soul is God, Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is it possible for us to communicate with plants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> With plants. Is it possible for us to communicate with plants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have done. Sir Jagadish Candra Bose in Calcutta, Bose Institute, he has proved-he has got machine-that they feel pains and pleasure, which is recorded in the machine. If you pluck one leaf, they feel. Immediately it is recorded in the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Could I come back to that eating of meat? Related to this alive, soul, matter. Aren't you in a sense eating another soul too if you're eating vegetables? Not only if you're eating meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is, the material world... It is said, <span class="Italic">jīvo jīvasya jīvanam:</span> "One living entity has to eat another living entity to keep himself alive." That is the natural law. But you should have discrimination. Because you have to eat some other living entity, it does not mean that you will eat your own son. You cannot support that "Because I have to live by eating another living entity, so what is the wrong if I eat my son?" Therefore the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> You are given some jurisdiction. You can eat. And actually you do so. Because I have to eat something, we do not eat anything and everything. We have got discrimination.

<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we accept what is eaten by Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa wants these things: fruits, flower, vegetable, grains, milk. So we offer them and eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Why not animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not say, "Give Me animals." Because we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, we cannot take anything which is not accepted by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Are blood transfusions permissible, Swami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says, "Are blood transfusions permissible?" When one is in an accident or cut and he loses blood, they take another man's blood and put it it. He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is not bad. Because if one life is saved by transfusion admission... He is not dying. He is living. He is contributing his blood. So if he is contributing, you are saving some life, there is no harm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But blood is animal tissue. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they liked?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Um, the younger ones liked better. The nurse was asking where she could..., if she could refer people to visit us here, and I told her we don't know if this will be the permanent address, but as soon as we have a permanent address here I'll notify her. But she was wondering if she could send people, if the people would be welcome to come and visit and see the place here. And the Buddhist boy, he bought an incense from us. He said, "Where is that nice smell coming from?" I said, "Incense." He said, "I want some." The other gentlemen I don't... They're more set in their ways kind of men. I couldn't tell whether they were impressed or not. They don't express very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But all their questions were answered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes. When you told him where is the man who has, where is the person who did not come from a father, he began to... Before that, he was going to challenge whether this was science or belief, but then he had to be quiet. He just mumbled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they inquired, "Then God has father?" No, God without father. That is God. That is the distinction between ordinary living entity and God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So I will try to arrange someone for tonight and tomorrow morning; that geographer, I hope. And the people from the radio conversation. They're very well known, actually. Because I asked the geographer man, I said, "Do you know this man, Tim Downs?" And he said, "Oh, yes. I have heard him many times."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tim Down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Tim Downs. He is the man who may come from radio to make a conversation. Then they will play it on radio. But I have to find out if he's coming. And in the case that there may be three people who want to come, so would it be possible for tonight to having two, maybe five o'clock and seven o'clock or something like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes. I will keep in touch with those people and let them know. I will send them some literature too. Should I go and telephone those people?</div>
