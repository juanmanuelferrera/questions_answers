<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with C.I.D. Chief<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>January 3, 1977, Bombay</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you expand it. A dog is thinking, "I am this body. I am bulldog," "I am greyhound." And man is also thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian." But they do not know their real identity, and they are fighting like dogs. And this is going on in the name of civilization. And when we put forward <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the first lesson is that <span class="Italic">aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase: [</span>Bg. 2.11] "Arjuna, you are talking like a very learned man, but you are lamenting about the body. But actually..." <span class="Italic">Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ:</span> "So far the body is con..., this is lump of matter. So whether it is dead or alive, nobody seriously think of it, no learned, <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span>" Of course, those who are fools, rascal, they can take it. But those who are actually learned, they do not talk about this body. So upon this statement just see the world situation. Everyone is busy on the concept of body. So what is the position of the world? <span class="Italic">Apaṇḍita,</span> ignorance. And such people are going on as learned scholars, as politicians and leaders and so on. So how there can be peace? If you bring different types of dogs, greyhound and bulldog and Indian dog and bring them-the "United Dog Association" (laughter)-so will there be peace? That is the position. I declared in Melbourne in a public meeting that this United Nation is the unity of barking dog. I told. It was published in the paper. They also criticized me, "The Swami has come to hound." (laughter) But that is actually the fact. If you become impartial judge, not on behalf of CID or anyone, then you see the actual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> That is the truth, eternal truth. What you have said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are speaking about Kṛṣṇa. So if I say that Kṛṣṇa says like this and it is a fact, then what is our fault? But they are taking very serious, just like especially nowadays in Western country they are opposing that "This philosophy is a brainwash." So this is our position. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ brūyāt priyaṁ brūyāt mā brūyāt satyam apriyam.(?)</span> The world situation is that you can speak truth if it is palatable. And if it is unpalatable, don't speak. But this thing cannot be maintained when you are preaching spiritual life. There we cannot cheat. Spiritual life must be declared very frankly. Not that we have to declare; it is already declared. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> The spirit soul is within this body. The body is different from the spirit soul, and as it is changing-the body is changing-similarly, after death, so-called death... Because spirit has no death, no birth. <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> So this knowledge is the beginning of spiritual life. And if you are preaching, they are opposing us. India also opposing. This is our position. They take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and they mislead them. And we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. That is our fault. So what we can do. Can you suggest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> (laughs) I am a layman. What...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... You should be very kind upon... And what we can do? And if I cheat in the name of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then I become a great leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> All nation has turned... An extraordinary order, you spreading the message of Kṛṣṇa to the world, message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at least Indians should join this movement. They're feeling the weight, the Western countries. They are opposing means that those who are thoughtful, they are thinking that "If this movement allowed to go on, then our civilization will be finished." That is their... That... They are right. They are right. If these young men, they go on under my instruction, I shall finish their civilization. That's a fact. No meat-eating in Western countries? (chuckling) No intoxication? No illicit sex? No gambling? That means their life is finished. And we are imitating, that "We are becoming advanced in civilization." And we are condemning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> But most of the people realize that that is not the real..., real kind of advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> We are helpless. I assure that will stand, but actually what we call advancement in... It is not. People themselves are realizing that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoṣitāṁ saṅgī-saṅgam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> ...that advancement has led them to some sort of monotony, which they want to avoid, and they want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, we must know the destiny of life, what is the destiny of life. Then whether we are advancing or degrading, then it will be decided. But they do not know what is destiny of life. They are so fools, they are thinking that this life, say, for hundred years, and after hundred years everything finished. The Russian big, big professor, they think like that. I went to Moscow, and I talked with Indologist. They say "Swamiji, after this body is finished, everything is finished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> I read somewhere that this scientist, Russian scientist, was making research through electronics as to what happens to the soul when man dies, what actually happens when man dies. What is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You may study with electronics and other, but it is a open secret. The soul departs from the body, and it is a lump of matter. What is the difference between a lump of matter and the dead body? We see practically a motorcar, when it is no more workable, it is a lump of matter. What is the value of it? Who cares for the motorcar? Of course, we do not see here, but in the Western countries there are many places. Oh, hundreds and thousands of cars are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Junk yard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundreds and thousands. Here, of course, we have not so many cars, but there in many cities I have seen. They have gathered together, and then they are pressed and thrown to the iron factory and again melted in fire of... So similarly, when the life is not there, it is a lump of matter. So it is lump of matter. Just like the motorcar. When it was being driven by driver, it has value, but when it is not to be driven anymore, it has no value. Similarly... But the motorcar is the same. It is the driver that is important. Similarly, the soul is important, not this body. But the modern civilization, accepting this body as the important, and they have no information of the driver, soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> They try to decorate it, a body, dead body. It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Decorating a dead body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> No, but I think this..., a lot of a wakening in the minds of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This education is lacking throughout the whole world, and we have started this movement to give this education, and people are against. That means they have become so fallen that they cannot even take up right knowledge. The same proverb: "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." So we have to struggle against this darkness, but we have to do it. This is our mission. We cannot stop it. It is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> People are kept in darkness, and... That is not Caitanya Mahāprabhu... Kṛṣṇa's mission actually. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "When people are misguided," <span class="Italic">tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham,</span> "at that time I come down." So the whole world is misguided on this bodily concept of life, and this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means Kṛṣṇa has come down in the shape of this movement. That is the real fact. <span class="Italic">Nāma-rūpe kṛṣṇa kali-kāle avatāra.</span> "In the <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> Kṛṣṇa is incarnated in the form of His name, Hare Kṛṣṇa." Therefore in this age... That... <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstras. Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya.</span> Simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">mukta-saṅga,</span> he becomes free from all this material contamination, and he <span class="Italic">paraṁ vrajet,</span> he goes back home, back to... So this name is not different. Because Kṛṣṇa is absolute, there is no difference between His name and Himself. And that is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> and Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends, <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> recommends. We're just following their footprints, that's all. <span class="Italic">Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ.</span> This Kali-yuga is the ocean of faults. So... But there is one great opportunity in this ocean of faults. What is that? <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ param... [SB </span>12.3.51]. That is a great facility to these rascals, that if they chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> they become free from all contamination and become fit for going back home, back to Godhead. So this is a authorized movement. It is not a concoction, manufactured idea. So we are doing that. Unfortunately, the people... Not all, but majority...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> It has gained tremendous and spontaneous response, and people, all people... It has... The strength has shown me that people have taken liking from their soul. Not just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, these young men, they have taken seriously. Otherwise what business they have got to join me? They have taken it seriously. And with their help I am little able to push on this movement. But they are taking it seriously. And big, big learned scholars, they have opined that this movement is not going to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> I saw the photograph yesterday, Vinoda Bhave, meeting with Vinoda Bhave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're showing the pictures of our Walda (?) meeting. I just showed him pictures of our Walda meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Vinoda Bhave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vinoda Bhave is also... He has issued some statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said "What Prabhupāda has done, no one has done," something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Otherwise, how can the West would have come to know about Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are all books by Prabhupāda, all. I was telling our book sales...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that telegram we have received yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was telling him our book sales are eight to ten <span class="Italic">lakh</span> rupees a day. All by Gurujī, all. Can you imagine, Śrīla Prabhupāda writes one book a month. [break] One <span class="Italic">lakh</span> seventy thousand big books. 90,737 medium books. 63,322 small books, and 437,420..., that is, four <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> Total in one week: seven <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and 9,236 books. In one week...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> There won't be such a big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda produces one book a month still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now... I am talking to you as a CID official. Now, here is my dictaphone. I... (clicks dictaphone switch) It is not working. (Prabhupāda plays back section of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> dictation he has made) This is a Sanskrit verse. (synonyms) <span class="Italic">Tatra(?) saumika.</span> So the whole night I write books, and then this is typed. In the daytime they are typing. And then it is composed, and then it is made into book, and we take so much trouble to sell it, as you got the selling of, and we collect money and they send money, ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees in India, and I construct the temple, not only here.(?) So is that my fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> No, no, no. The man who would say it is a fault, either he is mad or it would be mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this old age-eighty-one years I am-I am working day and night just to preach this Kṛṣṇa consciousness and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> This is absolutely a service to God and humanity. Whatever tendency you have... Whatever comes out of your mouth, word, becomes a religious... It is written, out of which you write books. Out of the produce... From the proceeds of that book, you constructed a... It is wholeheartedly towards the God. Whole life is devoted to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And for these books, as author, if I would have taken royalty, my daily income would have been one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> fifty thousand. I don't take a single farthing. Whatever two <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> they give, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Then if that had been the objective, so much of this (indistinct) not would have come in reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no appetite also. (laughs) I do not eat too much. Whatever, one or two <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis,</span> they give, I take. That's all. This is my royalty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> But any... How these politicians, they react to this in America? Do they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There also... Here. Here people are suspecting that I am getting money from CIA, and they are also suspecting that I am cheating people and getting money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Yeah, but do they have any prohibition about these religious discourses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not... Prohibition has yet come. But individual cases, they have been instituted, and we are fighting by spending so much money to defend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Yeah, but I read in some paper that somewhere they had this county courts, you know, ruling that people are disturbed by the <span class="Italic">kīrtanas</span> and this for twenty-four hours and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got judgment. You read those judgment, judges? We have got counterjudgements also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now, this is from Philadelphia, Judge Alfred Longo, U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia decree was typical and included the following points: "Kṛṣṇa consciousness is recognized as an authentic religion. To broadcast the glories of God to all people, members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society can perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> a missionary activity including chanting, dancing, and playing cymbals and drums, the dissemination of the word of God through preaching and reading aloud from religious literature, the distribution of religious literature, sanctified food and flowers to the public, and the solicitation and acceptance of contribution. In performing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> devotees can go wherever people gather: streets, libraries and other public places." So we also had decisions... Eventually we win almost all cases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have got good support from the scholarly section by big, big professors. Even one priest, Mr. Cox, he is forming an association to support this movement in Harvard University. So we have got supporters also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> People are also coming in a good number to join this organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian community, they are also supporting us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All the Indians abroad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Abroad. They got life. There was no temple. There was no <span class="Italic">hari-saṅkīrtana.</span> Now they are feeling obliged. In London every Sunday all Indian community, they come. And during the Janmāṣṭamī<span class="Italic">,</span> ten thousand people. Ten thousand people and the contribution was... What is? Twenty-five thousand pounds or...? One pound equal to twenty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fourteen rupees. Now it's fourteen rupees. It's coming down every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are giving... Practically our temple is going on by the contribution of the Indians. They are giving goods. Rice, <span class="Italic">dāl,</span> and <span class="Italic">ghee</span> and our... No scarcity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> The Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Deity(?) which is close to most of the Indians. It's a common...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sometimes they ask that "What is your position, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, in India?" And in India everyone is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Because if you read from beginning, like the childhood, all His childhood plays and mischiefs and this from the birth, then childhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every house. Even there are Muhammadan house, they observe Janmāṣṭamī. I know that. One professor in Allahabad, Kavi or something like... I went to his place. He's a great devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's one big movie star... Not very big. Sanjaya Khan. He's Muslim, but he wears a pendant of Kṛṣṇa always. He's our member. He's promised us a donation of ten thousand rupees after his picture is released. Many Muslims we have members now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's Indian Muslim. We have got Iranian Muslims. They are our devotees, many there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Well, sir, I would like to remain here, but now I have to go to my office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Bring <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, bring here. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> Just touch my hand, that's all, and make me cure bodily...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. Thank you. You come whenever you find time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He comes regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> I was longing to come, so today I came. It's my great fortune that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... That. Even as CID officer, you can note. This is my business. I am working hard, producing these books, selling, and the telegram you see, and bringing that money here. So if you thing that I am still faulty, then what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">CID Chief:</span> From the beginning I have made it clear that I come here to get some mental peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have Chinese <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Actually Trivikrama Swami has just come. He's been preaching in Taiwan. (breaks) (end)</div>
