<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...enjoy in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Don't forget Kṛṣṇa, Then you are well. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.</span> Such a nice park. If we hold <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> people gather and enjoy distribution of <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then it becomes very nice. And only to come here to find out sex facilities, then going to ruin. (Aside:) Give me that. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Very good park. [break] ...and for class of people, talking. This is required, philosophical talk, those who will understand. For mass of people <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And then when you start to talk, they become fidgety. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Or they want to argue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like for children, you give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> all will gather together. You see? And if you talk before them philosophy, what they will understand? (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...Rajneesh. I think he's just doing exercises.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Varieties of madmen. <span class="Italic">Keśava tuyā jagata vicitra</span> (?): "O My Lord Keśava, Your creation is full of varieties." (sound of man shouting in the background) The same Rajneesh process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Well, ah, Tamāla is going (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The vast ocean, how looks beautiful. There is God's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> As far as I know, the only publicity that was made from Vṛndāvana was the letters sent to the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they must have been preparing for that. Anyway... The scientist says hydrogen and oxygen is mixed into water. Who supplies so much hydrogen and oxygen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Only God. Would you say that from God's vantage point everything that happens here is not very significant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, there are many Sikhs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall return? [break] Bombay also has beach. Not much cold, not much heat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They now have an apartment for you in Juhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is our house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I think it is. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in the history there is no such action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There was one time on one of the other islands. It fell on someone, some child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Sometimes during a storm it may be loosened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Kṛṣṇa lets them fall in such a way that people don't get hurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...grow fruit, eh? [break] And if the fruit is green, it will never fall. Therefore when the fruits are grown, green, take it down. But that they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I don't know if they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they do not use coconut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No, they throw them away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They are not intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They don't know anything about <span class="Italic">dābs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They think <span class="Italic">dābs</span> is not good. Yes, <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> don't like the taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The only good thing is meat, for them. <span class="Italic">Kadarya-bhakṣana kare. Nānā yoni sadā phire, kadarya-bhakṣana kare</span></div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, kevala viṣera bhāṇḍa,<br class="calibre2"/>amṛta baliyā yebā khāya<br class="calibre2"/>nānā yoni sadā phire, kadarya-bhakṣaṇa kare<br class="calibre2"/>tara janma adhaḥ paṭe jāya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Do you understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No. I recognize <span class="Italic">khāya. Khāya</span> means eating, eats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? All abominable things. Not natural products. So, did you like that preparation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Which one was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh yes, it was very nice. You have taught them very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When is <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Saturday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Only thing I did not like was the bitter melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I did not like the bitter melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You did not like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It is too bitter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it was so nice. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Do you like it, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. It is very beneficial for the stomach and kidney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's like medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Your wife also did not like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Oh, she likes it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Then it is all right. You are American fools. And she is Japanese. Japanese are very intelligent. Yes. Extraordinarily. They're just like Bengalis. Yes. Because mostly they eat fish. Fish is very good thing. It has got sufficient quantity of phosphorus. So brain becomes nice-for this crude work, not for fine spiritual work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday I received a telephone call from Gopāla and he said that in a month-</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gopāla Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā: :</span>-yes, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa, Mahārāja, in Tokyo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, Gopāla Svāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Gopāla Svāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gopāla Svāmī, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And he said that within a month the society will be registered there in Japan. That the registration is finally coming to effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> There was also a telegram from Bhūrijana in Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And he's fully prepared for us to come and he's hoping that we'll come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, then prepare that. So by the twenty-eighth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, we'll inform him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall cross here or there?</div>
