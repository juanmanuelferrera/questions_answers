<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...take the credit. And what is your credit? It is already there for millions of years. Why you are anxious to produce this? Without your help it is being produced. So why you spending our hard-earned money and cheating us? You are cheater. You should be punished. These things are already going on. For you there is no scarcity of life. Then why you are spending our tax to show your talent? What is your talent? You are simply cheating us-"We shall do it..." You do or do not, the things are already there. Why you are taking our money to make research? You are cheating us. You should be punished. You will be punished. Even the state does not punish, you'll be punished by the Supreme Lord because you are cheating. So you can cheat us, but you cannot cheat God. Regular punishment will be there. Millions of years it has been going on, and I want to tell (?) you, just tell (?) you (indistinct). The same example-millions of dogs are barking, and this man has learned how to bark. He is selling tickets. You see? You are driving away barking dog, and because this rascal has learned how to bark, you have to pay for it. What do you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> So they would say, "Well, we do not claim any credit, but, similarly, you cannot give God credit, because it is going on as a biochemical reaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? That is your rascaldom. You cannot produce it. Why do you say like that? You rascal, you produce by biochemical combination. That is your rascaldom. That is not science. You are talking like a child. That's all. Credit must be given to God. He's already doing it very systematically. Why shall I... I am not such a fool that I have to give credit to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> No, that is not the question, to give credit to me. But just because you can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who is producing, either or God or somebody, or somebody is doing that. I must see, (indistinct) ...not to you. You may not accept God, but somebody is doing that. As you are trying to do it, similarly, somebody else is already there. Therefore he should get the credit. Why you are claiming to get the credit? That is not right. Anybody... Just like you are somebody, you are trying to take all the credit. So similarly, somebody is already doing. So he should get the credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Their objection is to "he."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why you are "he"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Oh, I'm simply attempting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Attempting... You are "he"? You are person. You are attempting. You are foolish, you are attempting. But there is another person who has already done it. As you are a person, you are trying to do it, it is being already done by another person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Maybe because I am person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not maybe. Maybe... As soon as you say "maybe" then you'll be slapped. No knowledge. It is not a question of "maybe." It must be factual. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Attack these rascals strongly in big, big meetings, and slap them, "Why you are cheating and spending our hard-earned money, taxes?" Better follow us. We are giving all credit to the person who has already..., going on with the big man. Very systematically it is going on. For ourself, we are human being. When there are long hairs, we cut. That person's (indistinct) is so nice... nobody's going to cut the (indistinct) ...of the street. But annually, they are already being changed. The whole (indistinct), thrown away. Who's doing that? You must get credit. It is very nice here in the springtime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They have never seen God. They can see chemicals, but they cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are trying. How you can see? You rascal, you are blind. You, how can you see? You have to treat your eyes, then you will see. We are seeing. We are not blind like you. You are blind. You require treatment. You come to the treatment. You cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They don't have faith in the doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They don't have faith in the doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how he claims to..., claims others' faith upon him? He's more than a doctor? Doctor is also as good as scientist as you are. If you do not have faith in the doctor why do you claim people should have faith in you? Where is the proof that you'll be able? Why you are asking us blindly to follow you? What is your answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Sometimes they say that if we can control, if we can produce...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I'm protesting that you cannot control. You are rascal. You are thinking like that. That is our charge against you, that you cannot control. In the history there is not a single instance that man has controlled nature. But nature has controlled man. That is the history. Where is the proof that you shall control? You are controlled. Nature is forcing you to become an old man. You are becoming. You control like that, that you remain a young man. Nature is controlling you to die. You control nature that death will not be forced upon me. So where is the history that man has controlled nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> They say that now we are controlling atomic energy and now we are controlling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that atomic energy? What is the use of it? We'll die. Without atomic energy you'll die. What is that control? Death is already there, and you're utilizing atomic energy for death, that's all. So what is your credit? You use atomic energy that you'll not die. Then it is control. Death is already there. You might have atomic energy or no atomic energy-you have to die. By atomic energy you are accelerating the same problem of death, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gradually we are learning how to become deathless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They will argue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That is called hope against hope. That is foolishness. Therefore we say because you are expecting like that, therefore we understand that you are a fool. We can immediately understand, "Here is a grand fool." That is our study. Many fools have done like that, and you are one of them, you are also scientific (indistinct). Therefore our conclusion is "You are Fool No. 1."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We may not be able to actually stop death, but while we're here we can at least prolong our lifetime and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also you cannot do. Where is the proof?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, at the atomic research plants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is another foolishness, I say. You have not done it. You are simply expecting. Hope against hope. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But they are making different cures for critical diseases that are causing deaths...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But that does not mean there will be no disease. That is already being done by many medical practitioners. Better medicine. But where is the medicine that will not be disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gradually we are eliminating one by one all the diseases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you have not done. No disease... You have increased diseases. You have stopped one disease and increased another. Not stopped! But you have increased another disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have to learn though how to prevent all these diseases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are fool. You have to learn. That means you have to learn, means you are fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> But we are learning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't assert it, that you have done it already, you shall do it... As soon as you say we have to learn, that means you are fools. And while you are student, why you are claiming all these perfections? You have to learn. That you have to learn from us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually, when I was in Germany, there was evidence of how the scientists increased disease. They invented some vaccine to counteract influenza, and they injected all of Germany with this vaccine. But what happened is sometimes the body builds up resistance to these vaccines and produces another germ. So, as a result, another type of influenza was created, which was far more worse than the previous. It made people get fever for four and five days straight, 105 degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the way of... They have discovered this streptomycin, for tuberculosis, that if one takes too many injections of streptomycin, then it does not act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He becomes immune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So as a result of the vaccine they created a worse type of influenza, and they have nothing to counteract that worse type. So now they have to invent another type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals give trouble to the people, especially in India. They are not after the vaccine. They will catch people and force them. Just see. This is going on. (indistinct) ...others are avoiding, they are going, going this way, that way. Sometimes they fall, they do not know, and capture (indistinct) These rascals are creating havoc. Only to kick them on their face with shoes. That's all. The so-called scientists and biologists and... They do not know anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were saying that all the scientists are fools and rascals but they may challenge, "How has your knowledge benefited you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your knowledge has not benefited you. Our taking your so-called science has benefited you because you are using it for Kṛṣṇa. You have worked so hard, so result is going to Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa. We are making the best... (indistinct) ...there is chair but we don't care for the chair. We can sit down. But if it is available we don't reject it. Therefore (indistinct) ...you have made a chair and (indistinct) ...Not that I require your chair, without your chair I will, shall die. That is not my policy. You rascal, you have done something, I'm using it for your benefit. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They may argue that the knowledge which you say you have, it doesn't stop all of these things from happening to you. You're also suffering from symptoms of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But I'm trying because I have got this material body like you, so I have to suffer like you. But I'm making treatment. You are not making treatment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the effects appear to be the same on everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are not so much after doctors or medical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your students also suffer from diseases and all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So long the body's there, one has to suffer. That we tolerate. That is advised in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mātrā sparśās tu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>āgamāpāyino nityās<br class="calibre2"/>tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Titikṣa,</span> we know how to tolerate. We are not mad after curing. We know these things will happen so long I have got this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So your difference is that you tolerate, whereas the scientists don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we know that there is no cure. You do not know. You are trying to cure. That is the difference between you and me. We know so long I have got this body, I'll have to suffer. So we do not stop our business. We tolerate and do our business. That's all. But you have no business. You are simply trying, hope against hope. But it will never be fulfilled. Just like birds, bees, they do not know science. But so long they have got this body, they are also sometimes diseased. But they have no science, how they are cured? The same thing, just like this tree, they have no scissors, so how their leaves are being trimmed, falling down, (indistinct). We have discovered scissors, or clippers, but you have no clippers. How their hairs, or their leaves are being cut?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, according to archeological findings primitive man, before, when they would get some disease they would just die. And now modern science has developed so nicely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is there. And who is not dying now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, well, well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...they died at thirty, forty years old. Now we're dying at a hundred years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the difference? You die after forty years or hundred years? These trees dies after thousands years. Does it mean the trees are better than you? (Devotees laugh) If one dies after one thousand years, does it mean his life is successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But all of us want to live longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Who is allowing to live long? If you trying to live longer, already trees are living longer than you. Then a tree is better than you? By living longer you want to take some credit, then trees should be given that credit. That is the point. Many big, big men, they lived for short time. Just like Śaṅkarācārya lived for thirty-two years, Caitanya Mahāprabhu lived for forty-eight years. They're still living! There are so many followers of Śaṅkarācārya, so many followers of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Kṛṣṇa, told that He lived for 125 years and Kṛṣṇa is still living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Jesus Christ only lived for 36 years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who's caring for any tree who lives for five thousand years? If that is your point, to live long is a great credit, there are already so many living entities who live long, longer than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well they don't... they may be living a long time but they don't have the same intelligence how to use their life span...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...the dogs also got intelligence, the hogs also got intelligence. The intelligence which you are claiming, that is all discussed in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> It is said yes they are living, but you don't see that breathing. So then the <span class="Italic">vastra,</span> the bellow, it is breathing. "Waa, waa, waa, waa." It is breathing in the (indistinct) and it is (indistinct), the <span class="Italic">vastra.</span> It is breathing (indistinct). Here they are living but you don't see they have any sex enjoyment (indistinct). The dogs and hogs, they are having very good sex enjoyment, even on the street, without any restriction, and begetting three dozen children in a year. And they give credit to whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Apart from science, we have very nice philosophy and literature, studying art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is real science. Science we admit, but your science is not. You are trying to go against the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about our art and literature which just shows that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is different department so far science is concerned. But pure science is useless, simply useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we acknowledge that, suppose we acknowledge that, but we say that still our cultural advancements are very great. The students say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say "Why...?" Many people I meet in the university they're not involved with science very much. Their main dealings are with culture, literature, arts, philosophy, music. They say... He feels we have very wonderful, beautiful things to study so why should we take up studying what you have to offer. There's so much to study with what we're doing. Why should we join your movement? Why should we give up studying such beautiful music and art and literature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you'll like it. And there is beautiful sounds, you'll hear it. Even animals hear it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you sing the same song all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But do you hear it? As soon as you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> hundreds of persons, they'll have to hear it. Ask them not to hear it. You go, you scientists, (indistinct) ...don't hear it. They hear it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But your music is of one chanting is very limited. Chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you finish this limited, then you go to unlimited. You have no experience of this limited, what to speak of the unlimited. Kṛṣṇa has described you <span class="Italic">mūḍhās,</span> and you have taken (indistinct) are <span class="Italic">mūḍhās.</span> (indistinct) ...to have to take credit in so many way that our conclusion is following the footsteps of Kṛṣṇa. You are all <span class="Italic">mūḍhās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like some people may express God by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa but we can also express God through our musical talent. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You decorate God so nicely (indistinct) ...art painting, everything. They, putting art, so many thing, (indistinct). There's no scarcity of art painting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are trying to attain the Supreme through our own music. We are doing that through our own mus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is... That is another nonsense. We are trying to please the Supreme by the Supreme music. <span class="Italic">Golokera prema-dhana hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana.</span> These sounds are not (indistinct) These are Vaikuṇṭha songs. <span class="Italic">Nārada muni bājaya vīṇā rādhikā-ramaṇa nāme.</span> It is words by Nārada Muni. It is not manufactured here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't you think that the great musicians like Bach, they were inspired by God to make this music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they (indistinct) do not believe in God. So that is another thing. But this music is like you are hearing music ten thousand miles away. Similarly, this music is being imported from Vaikuṇṭha many millions and many millions of miles away. So this is not just music of this mundane sound. Otherwise why you are not tired repeating it for many, many days? Any mundane sound, we repeat it, you cannot prolong it. You cannot prolong it. But we are (indistinct) only Hare Kṛṣṇa and you can chant this. And you also hear it. You (are) attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> You have said that variety is the mother of enjoyment. So we are enjoying many different songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless there is variety how we are enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes. So therefore you only have one song. But we have many songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Who cares for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> So many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there are so many symphonies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our credit. We have got one song and we are attracting so many. You have got many songs but you attract yourself only. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When there is a symphony orchestra, ten thousand, twenty thousand people have come to hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who takes it seriously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They all do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They stay here and go away. That's all... Temporary, temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But then they will also buy the record and listen at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but our song, we are chanting always, where is that song you have got? You have got (indistinct) ...he has to give new record. Nobody cares for the old record. (indistinct) ...then his business will stop. If you say that "I have given one song, that's all." (everybody laughs) Who'll care for it? That is our credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But they will say only a select few are interested in that Hare Kṛṣṇa song.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Not select few. They're increasing the number, many thousands. Cannot say select few. Select few was beginning (indistinct) ...I was chanting (indistinct). And now that it is not select few and it will increase. But the song is the same. That is our credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Going back to science again...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Going back... Where is science? Going back to hell again. Say "going back to hell again". Say like that. (chuckles) Because that is not science. That is our charge. You can say like that: "Going back again to hell."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We wanted to talk to you about the moon. We have read your statement that you say that man has not gone to the moon, but we have seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only now, I've said long, long years ago. That this is all childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But how can you say this when we have so much proof that we have gone to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that proof is with you. I have not gone with you. I don't believe you because, according to you, unless you see, you don't believe. I have not seen so I don't believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have not seen the North Pole but you believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah ha. You materialistic people say that "We have not seen God, therefore don't believe." Therefore I say, "I have not gone with you, that you have gone to moon, I don't believe." That's all. Finished. How can I believe? You say that you have gone. But I have not gone with you. So how can I believe. That's all. That is my argument. You did not take me with you. How can I believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why I shall believe pictures? I have not seen it. This is false picture. As you say that you could not saw God therefore don't believe. Therefore I say that I did not go with you, I don't believe.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you take then I shall believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, we can show some rocks. We can show some rocks that you won't find anywhere on this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is refuted. The other scientists, they have said these rocks can be found here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One thing is that in your <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it says that the atom is the smallest particle but yet we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, smaller than atom there is. Atom is called <span class="Italic">paramāṇu.</span> Then it is <span class="Italic">anugra paramāṇu,</span> (?) smaller than the atom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Does that mean the electrons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever you say. But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is there. (devotees laugh) Be convinced of your footing, (chuckles) otherwise you'll be defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the other day we were talking about proving different assumptions through archeological findings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also bogus. Archeological findings is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But it seems that big skeletons of all these big dinosaurs...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have already information. We have got <span class="Italic">timiṅgala.</span> Just like big house. They can swallow up, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Whale. Whale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whale (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No but these dinosaurs move on the land. They're not fish. And they're very big and we have information...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is to you? You are also a created being. He's also created being. That's the (indistinct). You are not creator of the (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you say that there was more intelligent life previously, whereas we see these dinosaurs were previously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not see, you simply imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. We have the skeletons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have the bones, the bones of animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that's all right. There was a big animal, that's all. Just like you are a foolish animal, so there was a big animal. What is the difference? They are animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we have skeletons showing the men at that time also and their brains were very tiny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you say. But I don't believe it. I have not seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they have skeletons in the museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Very thick skulls and very small brains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Almost like a ape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. There was a big animal. So what is the difference? They are animals, big or small. You have seen a skeleton of pygmy man also. So where is that man now? You have seen pygmy man, you don't require archeological. So where is that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they don't live any more. Now we are more intelligent. Previously there were pygmy men, very less intelligent, small, not nice looking. Now we have got more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> you are going to be pygmy men. That is, there is proof, because you are not as strong as your forefathers. That's a fact. You are becoming dwarfer, dwarfer. According to our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> you come to that pygmy, (indistinct) in due course of time. As it was before, so again the time is repeating, history repeating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then that means our pygmy men were from a previous Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We say there was Kali-yuga. Four <span class="Italic">yugas</span> are changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dinosaurs also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. There are 8,400,000 species of life. You have seen some of them. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the question is that why are there not any findings from only 5,000 years ago at the time when Kṛṣṇa was here and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your knowledge has come to Darwin's theory for 200, not even 200 years.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things are coming according to their research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the city of Dvārakā? We do not find it remaining anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Might have (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we cannot believe what we don't see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Actually the scientists don't accept this theory at all any more about the man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The more advanced scientists, the more up-to-date ones, they reject this whole Darwin thing. But it's become so ingraded in the minds of the people that they have published, this <span class="Italic">Life, Time Magazine,</span> they publish millions of books and sell it. People read about ape man, the man came from the ape and so on. It's become such a popular, it's like a fairy tale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Propaganda, it is propaganda. That's all. Propaganda, you can do any false thing (indistinct) say. This is called, propaganda is called in Bengali <span class="Italic">dāsa cakre bhagavān butha</span> (?). <span class="Italic">Dāsa cakre bhagavān butha.</span> Bhagavān, one gentleman's name was Bhagavān and he spread, conspired that let us, make us some joke that she has become ghost.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's saying that he has to create the market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good things, does it require...? That is propaganda. You have got some false thing, you have to make propaganda to prove it, that it is real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That is the proof it is false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this man has taken money for... And he cannot supply even maintenance for his wife and girl. You have seen Mālatī?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He got a cheat wife. Eh? Mother said she cheated that "I am twenty-six years."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So many things she cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he wanted to be cheated.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She even said that she had four stillborn children. And we went to the hospital and there was no record of her having even been admitted to the hospital. Bali Mardana, she told him to wait downstairs while she gave birth to the four children and then two hours later she came down, she said, "Now it is finished." And he took her and drove away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mesmerized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And there was talk that you had said that those four stillborn children were incarnations of Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, she was think that by cheating this man I am becoming successful. Then she, without any restriction, she began to cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because he was Mahārāja so he became, she became Mahārānī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But still he's being fooled by her. Those birds I think are the ones from the cage. Because they're being fed they're all, agree to be...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like, the human beings are like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Do you think that... As the Kali-yuga progresses the people are getting smaller. Does this mean that Kṛṣṇa and His associates were much taller in stature than we are now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They were much bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen that Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, Kṛṣṇa footprint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That means Kṛṣṇa must have been fifteen or twenty feet tall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) But it is a fact formerly people were taller. We have seen. In our childhood we have seen, when European, they were very tall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They were taller and they lived longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That story about King Mucukunda when he was sleeping in the cave and he came out of the cave and looked outside and he said, "Oh, it must be Kali-yuga." because the trees were smaller and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you (indistinct) ...the mango trees now? Some of the trees (indistinct), the lemon tree, stunted. In Japan they grow many trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In Japan they cultivate trees to be like that, very small. They have little orange trees. Orange trees are this big, orange trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are also becoming oranges. Japanese enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The Japanese and Chinese are very, very small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did it...? [break] ...special. There is a proverb, <span class="Italic">kalo brāhmaṇa kota śūdra bete mussulman kalki chele busi...</span> (?) A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> black... <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa's</span> another name is <span class="Italic">śukla,</span> white.

Kota śūdra,</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> just like African, if they become white there is something mystery. <span class="Italic">Kalo brāhmaṇa kota śūdra bete mussulman,</span> Mohammedan, because Mohammedan means the Afghans, they are very tall, so a Mussulman is dwarf, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is black, the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is white, <span class="Italic">kalo brāhmaṇa kota śūdra bete mussulman</span> and <span class="Italic">kalki chelo,</span> that means the bastard and (indistinct) ...these are all of the same class. Adopted son, he gets money, without any labor, he spends like anything. In your country there is adopted son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here there are many adopted son. A rich man has no son. He adopts somebody, rascal, and he spends money like... There are so many instance. Squanders. He'll be satisfied after finishing... There are many instances. In our childhood, many you have heard, you have seen one, when the adopted son (indistinct) ...big property and he was not satisfied to squander all the money unless it became (indistinct) That I've seen. He had many cars and I saw him, he was drenched by water, rainfall, sitting in a rickshaw. Nobody cares for him. When he was rich, big, big men would come to see him, even Burdwan Mahārāja. Now I saw him that he was in Dharmatala, it was raining and he was sitting in a rickshaw. Nobody cares for him. And he was satisfied at that time after finishing the whole money. Otherwise hundreds and two hundred friends, there was very big house, bring, I mean to say, received as guests daily. (indistinct) His name was Arendranath(?) Sil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a Hindu name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sil. Sil means cultured. A cultured man is called <span class="Italic">sil.</span> Sushil. Sushil means very culture, very... Sushil. So <span class="Italic">kalo brahm...</span> This is unnatural. <span class="Italic">Kalo brāhmaṇa kota śūdra bete mussulman, kanki chele...</span> (indistinct) Now generally people, we saw, in our childhood, Europeans were very tall and now they are not coming (indistinct). Naturally when they'll not get sufficient nourishment, they'll be stunted. And Kali-yuga means decrease of nourishment, necessities of life decreasing. We see in such a rich man's house, there is no milk. Milk is one of the important nourishment foods. And there is no milk. So gradually there'll be no milk, no rice, no wheat, no sugar. These are stated. Where you'll get nourishment? And the mango, there'll be no pulp, only the seed. These are predicted. After all, you have to live by nature's gift, but these things will be finished. And Russia there is, already there is no rice. There is no fruit. There is no vegetable. Simply we eat meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore they cannot understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not they. They understand, the people understand. But this, this rascal government. That I have studied. Russian people are not bad. They're as good as others. But this is... Just like in India, still the mass of people, they're very good. And too mu... Yesterday we saw, all rascals, all these politicians canvassing, all big, big fat rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We were noting that when they were giving their lectures at that opening of the train station they seemed very demonic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All demonic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Their faces were very shifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So much anxiety and so much political dealings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All very fatty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They, they... the other's money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The peo... I didn't see one village man who was fatty, not one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not one. They're extracting money from them, making them intoxicated and exploiting. This is the fault. Very precarious condition. [break] So if you can make one example [break] India, that spot, very good example, then we can capture the whole India. Simply, we have got enough land. Give them enough food. Make them stout and strong, both the animal and man. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Let them hear. Everything will be all right. Everything will be ideal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No one can object either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's the beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make the whole field green, [break] sumptuously, let the animals eat, let the man eat. They feel satisfaction and they [break] He knows some people, they are being exploited, animals are being exploited by these rogues, fat, big, big, fat rogues. Discovering some nonsense, scientific means and people are starving. There is no food. And they're busy in discovering scientific method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Atomic bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Atomic bomb for India. That is the greatest paradox.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a picture... some deputation came to the minister that we are starving. There is no food. The administrator, he went, "Of course I have no information that you have no, but we're advanced now. Come tomorrow, there will be radio message. Radio message, radio, there's television, ha television..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Television, tomorrow, from tomorrow you'll have television.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Instead of food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instead of food you'll get television. (laughing) Advanced. This is going on. "I am hungry, sir. What shall I do with television?" That is the real answer. Say "I'm hungry. What shall I do with the television?" But he's pacifying, "Don't worry, you'll get television." This is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cheaters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is science. People, for want of sufficient nourishment, they are becoming dwarf and they are discovering scientific method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Intoxication... By increasing the intoxication the desire for food reduces. You eat less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore they are very much dizzy. And little hunger satisfied with meat. That's all. That is going on in the western country. The drinking... I have seen in airplane, bottles after bottle, they are drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Actually they have run a survey in America and they have found out that the greatest drug takers are housewives. The housewives, they are taking these weight-watching pills and they are addictive amphetamines. They are taking them and it gives them energy and they don't want to eat so much. So they are very skinny. They drink a little coffee and smoke cigarettes and take some pills and that is all during the day. Finished. And they remain very slim. And they think this is nice. So gradually they are replacing foodstuffs with pills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nature's way because there will be no food in the future. So nature is training them how to live without food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The whole civilization is becoming expert in killing and dying. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got some agricultural experience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all. Anyway, that not very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No. I can take advice from the experts. That man with the white beard there, he's supposed to know very much. He's supposed to be very expert, and he speaks English. He's supposed to have agricultural experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Jayapatāka had no agricultural experience.</div>
