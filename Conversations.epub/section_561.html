<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...if there is government laws, if you do not know it and you act independently, then you are making your life risky. So this is the case of the government law, and what to speak of God's law, nature's law, how strict it is. You can avoid government's law, but you cannot avoid nature's law. That is not possible. So that is the defect of the modern civilization: they do not know how nature is working, and they are keeping themself in ignorance, and they are suffering, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> one body after another. And if he becomes a tree, stand up for five thousand years. And we have to pass through all these stages. He has come to the human form of body. Still he neglects. He continues suffering. They are mad after sense enjoyment; and accepting different material bodies, that means suffering. As soon as you accept a material body, this is suffering. But the suffering of the trees is more suffering. In a forlorn place he stand up for five thousand years and tolerate all the blast, wind, scorching heat, water.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">He doesn't know that "I may become a tree like this." Then he must be... Why there are varieties of life? This is different type of punishment for different kinds of sinful activities. And he doesn't care for sinful activities. He got the human form of body, he doesn't care. Saintly persons, they are coming as Caitanya Mahāprabhu or Buddha or Christ. They are warning, "You do not do this." No, they will do it. So who is responsible for his sufferings? He is responsible. And so long he has got this short duration of life, fifty or sixty years or utmost hundred years, he is thinking, "I am free. Whatever I want, I can do," and making life risky. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> He is not independent. He knows that. Still, he will declare independence and suffer. This is the position. He is not independent; that he knows very well. But still, he will act independently. Is it not the position? Who can think that he is independent unless he is a madman? Hmm? Are you independent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is independent. And still, everyone is thinking independent, "I can do anything I like." Yesterday morning we were talking. You are independent. That is, means, misuse of independence. Just like in a state every citizen is independent but dependent on the state laws. If he forgets that, that "I am not dependent on the state laws," then he is foolish. Similarly, if one does not know that "The nature's law is the God's law, state laws; I cannot violate it," (sic:) then he is sober. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> One man is dying. A <span class="Italic">dhīra</span> knows that he is changing his body; he is not dying. He will get another body. <span class="Italic">Dhīra,</span> sober. And one who is not sober, he says, "No, life is finished." Or he can imagine he is going to heaven or hell. But a <span class="Italic">dhīra</span> knows what is going to happen to him. If he was in the material modes of nature, goodness, then he is going to higher planetary system. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti.</span> From <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we can understand. If he is in passion, then he will stay in this material world.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">And if he is in ignorance, then he is going to be animal. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati.</span> He knows. So he understood what is meant by first-class men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He seemed to understand a lot. I don't know if he could understand completely, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> As he walked out the door he said, "Now I have to go back and lead my fourth-class life." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes, he said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Then he has understood. Yes, it is all fourth-class men. He is considered a first-class man in the society. We say to him that "You are a fourth-class man." On what strength we can say like that? And he has to admit. That is our philosophy. Any first-class man, so-called first-class man, we can also say that "You are a fourth-class man," and he will agree. And if he admits, then he becomes first-class man. Then he can make progress. "I am living, a fourth-class man. I must be a first-class man." That is knowledge. So he was asking you, "Are you living first-class now?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, he said, "Are you all becoming first-class men? You want to become first-class men?" Before he left he said it was very nice meeting... And he looked and he said, "It's nice meeting you all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are trying to make some first-class men. That's all. This is our aim. Even if he is fourth-class man, it doesn't matter. If he takes up the training, he becomes first class. And as soon as he becomes a first-class man, <span class="Italic">ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti,</span> even if he is not liberated, he goes in higher planetary system amongst the demigods. Then there he gets more advanced. He goes to Brahmā. If he is not directly transferred to the spiritual world, then he gets these facilities. And with Brahmā, at the end of this creation, annihilation, they go to the spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just by becoming first-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is described. <span class="Italic">Śamo damas titikṣā,</span> that... You were not here, hearing? That is first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So just by becoming first-class men you can go to the heavenly planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that is meant for a first-class man. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti. Ūrdhvam</span> means higher planetary system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Are we not training all classes of men? In Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can train any class to become first class. It is simply by education. Just like anyone can become engineer by training. Where is the difficulty? Nobody is born first class, but we can make first class if he agrees to become first class. Two things required: he must agree, and the teachings are there. Then he becomes first class. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But you say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that the four classes are necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They already there, four classes of men, but they should be properly trained up. Then the society will be in order. Just like this man, he is considered to be first-class man in the society. He is in charge of some department. But actually, he is fourth class. So as he is little trained up by a moment's instruction, if he agrees to be trained up, he can become. He's young man, within thirty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Hmm. A very high position also. CSIRM. Commonwealth Science and Industrial Research Organization. He's commissioned by the government. They have to be very top intellectual researcher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> And he is in a good position materially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You spoke to three of those men in Melbourne last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Those scientists who came to see you last year in Melbourne were also from that organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The same place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There were three men and you made them eat the <span class="Italic">gulabjammon.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ah. He was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No, no. But they were from the same organization, the Melbourne branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. The same scientists came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. They were from the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he remembers. Then that man remembers, I gave him <span class="Italic">gulabjammon.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No, not this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That other man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Oh, yes. He sure did. That's a all-over Australia organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They are inquisitive because they come to see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh, you did not invite him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes, but he would not come unless he was interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the modern society there is no idea of first-class man, what is first-class man. They take it, a minister is first-class man. A first-class man is by these qualities: <span class="Italic">śamo damas titikṣā.</span> It is not by the fat salary. By the first-class qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Some people, like this man, they notice that qualities are degrading and natural resources are degrading, so many problems are coming. But they don't know what to do. They're simply reporting that "There we go down."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot counteract. The counteraction is here in our society. They should accept it. Then it will be all right. So become first-class man. Everyone will hear you. And you can face any so-called first-class man and talk with him straightforward that "You are fourth class." (laughter) (devotees offer obeisances) (end)</div>
