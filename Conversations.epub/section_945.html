<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To the right, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (to devotee:) I have to set up for massage. You can do the machine? It's recording now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice sitting place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Above all the noise in New York City, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa;:</span> It's not so noisy up here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pālikā wants to ask you something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Would you like to take fruit now, or <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> as regular?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I have taken breakfast. So Bali-mardana Prabhu<span class="Italic">,</span> doing all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Those are your servants' quarters, and the kitchen, and there's also a dresser in your bedroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is any closet with lock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. This closet here is a walk-in closet. Small room with a lock. You also have a cabinet that locks. It's a big walk-in closet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. So I shall again stay in New York? Nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> From this window here you can see the Empire State Building and all the big buildings in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There will not be any noise here either, because this is the eleventh floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So it's very peaceful for translating work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. (pause) My Guru Mahārāja left alone, so he has sent so many gurus to take care of me. You are all my Guru Mahārāja's representatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> We are <span class="Italic">guru dāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are taking care. I am very much obliged to you. I sometimes think in my childhood I was very, very pet son of my father. I have admitted that in that book I told. My father was not very rich man, but still, whatever I wanted, he would give me. He never chastised me, but full love. Then of course I got friends and I was married, so by Kṛṣṇa's grace everyone loved me. (laughs) And I came to this foreign country without any acquaintance. So Kṛṣṇa has sent so many fathers to love me. In that way I am fortunate. At the last stage if I live very peacefully, that is a great mercy of Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa's mercy everything is possible. So we shall stick to Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet and everything is possible. What is that book? After <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book? No, after <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, that yellow...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>So distribute this <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>. So Eighth Canto is also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is going out to the printer in the month of July, this month, by the end of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, first part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, but there is also a third part to the Seventh Canto, that is coming any day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Cyavana Mahārāja, you are making your mind fixed up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes, I'm feeling like my old self again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you are good boy. Whatever is done is done. Now remain with Vaiṣṇavas and fix up your mind. After all, it is a struggle between <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and Kṛṣṇa. Sometimes due to our weakness we may fall down, but we should take again strength and stand up. Do that, and combinedly push this movement in America. It is a good field. And if you can establish this movement in America, whole world will take. That is my mission. What is the length and breadth of this house area?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> I don't know exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the..., no? The hall is very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> See, it goes around, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You can walk around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can show you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On each floor it is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every floor has about twenty-five to thirty rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only this portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, all the way round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The long part is in the front. It goes all the way down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall take my massage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
