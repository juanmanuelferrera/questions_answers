<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "Performance of sacrifice, study of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> austerity and simplicity, nonviolence, truthfulness, freedom from anger, renunciation, tranquillity, aversion to fault-finding, compassion and freedom from covetousness, gentleness, modesty and steady determination, vigor, forgiveness, fortitude, cleanliness, freedom from envy and the passion for honor-these transcendental qualities, O son of Bharata, belong to godly men endowed with divine nature." (purport) "In the beginning of the Fifteenth Chapter the banyan tree of this material world was explained. The extra roots coming out of it were compared to the activities of the living entities, some auspicious, some inauspicious. In the Ninth Chapter also the <span class="Italic">devas,</span> or godly, and <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> the ungodly or demons, were explained. Now according to Vedic rites, activities in the mode of goodness are considered auspicious for progress on the path of liberation, and such activities are known as <span class="Italic">daivī prakṛti,</span> transcendental by nature. Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The defect of modern civilization is that they have no idea about liberation. Neither they have any idea about transmigration of the soul. From the very root, they are defective. They are thinking... Just like animals. Dog is thinking, "I am this dog. I am born dog and I'll die, that's finished, everything." He cannot think that "I can become also man." He cannot think that. So the modern civilization, they cannot think even that there is next life and we can go... They have got the tendency to go to the higher planetary system, moon. Artificially, they are trying, but they do not know. Just like they can go to any planet, <span class="Italic">sarvaga. Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṛn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ [Bg. 9.25].</span> They do not know this, although they have got the tendency to go. But they do not know how to go, positively what are the position of the different planets or Vaikuṇṭhaloka or liberation or next life, transmigration-nothing of the sort. Simply like dogs. Now consider this point, whether I'm speaking right or wrong. I know I am speaking the right thing, but if you deny, then you talk amongst yourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they think that liberation means that you can do anything you like, that you are free from any moral or ethic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the rascaldom. That is rascaldom. Just like in prison house, if a prisoner thinks that he can do whatever he likes, that is rascaldom. That is going on. The modern civilization is rascaldom. He is seeing practically that he's under the control of material nature, and still he thinks that "I can do whatever I like." This is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Christian conception of salvation was more one of being saved from hell rather than an attraction for some transcendental reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christian conception... Mass of people, they do not know what is hell because they are living in the hell already. That was the story. When hell was described, he was undisturbed, but when he was informed that there was no newspaper in hell then he became... "Horrible. How one can live there without newspaper?" So so far hellish condition is there now... Pradyumna, where is Pradyumna Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuladri:</span> He is showering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was describing about that factory. So they are working in the factory, what do they care for hell? Even if we go to hell, they will get some good salary, that's all. Money required, then I can drink nicely. The standard is there. Now this qualification, <span class="Italic">abhayaṁ sattva-saṁśuddhir,</span> what is that? It does not strike them at all, these qualities are high qualities. Is it not? This is the... What is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "Fearlessness, purification of one's existence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who is fearless? Everyone is fearful. And fearlessness is good quality, who understands it? <span class="Italic">Ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca,</span> this is animal life. To eat, sleep, sex and become fearful, that is animal life. And one has to become fear<span class="Italic">less.</span> So who cares for it? They are thinking to become fearless means to keep gun. That is also one way. Then, fearlessness and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "Purification of one's existence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they do not know. When they fall sick, then they want to purify, go to the physician, but his whole life is impure, he doesn't know. Because it is impure, therefore they are subjected to birth, death, old age and disease. That they do not know. But if you scrutinizingly examine all these different items of advancement of life, the modern man has no idea. That is being explained in this chapter. Therefore there is no such education, neither people are interested. Now higher art classes in the colleges, universities, no student will join. They are simply learning technological process. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "Those who are situated in the transcendental nature make progress on the path of liberation. For those who are acting in the modes of passion and ignorance, on the other hand, there is no possibility of liberation. Either they will have to remain in this material..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say "What we care for liberation? It is troublesome. You have to sacrifice so many things. We don't want liberation. That is nonsensical. You keep your liberation. We don't want." This is the problem. As you said, liberation means "Whatever I like I will do." But that is, actually, he cannot do that. But he's thinking that he's liberated. Can he do that, whatever he likes? But still he's... Therefore rascal. Dog's life. The dog is jumping, barking, that "I'm free now." But he forgets that as soon as the master will call and chain him, he'll do it. But he's thinking that "I'm liberated." This is the problem. What is his liberation? He does not know what is liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "Either they will have to remain in this material world as human beings or they will descend among the species of the animals or even lower life forms."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, they will say, "All bogus. This life, finished. I am free." That is the problem. This is their position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> We were finding, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that they could not defeat <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama dharma.</span> They had no society like <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> In the colleges, they could not understand this body, but we showed them how the society could be arranged harmoniously, and they had no alternative. Their ideas on how to structure society for everyone's happiness, they have no good ideas. So that preaching platform they could understand, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll understand. I'm just pointing out the difficulties of your preaching. You'll have to face all these difficulties. They're like cats and dogs. They are not even human beings. Therefore the business is little hard job. You have to deal with cats and dogs. But still there is hope, because they have got this human form of life. There is hope. It is not hopeless. Don't be disappointed, but this is the job. You have to meet with cats and dogs. That is my point. When you go to preach you must know that "I've come to preach among cats and dogs, and I have to deal with them carefully; otherwise, they will bark." (laughter) Therefore I wrote that poetry in disappointment before entering in your country, that "What they will understand, this philosophy?" Hmm, go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "In this Sixteenth Chapter the Lord explains both the transcendental nature and its attendant qualities as well as the demoniac nature and its qualities. He also explains the advantages and disadvantages of these qualities. The word <span class="Italic">abhijātasya</span> in reference to one born of transcendental qualities or godly tendencies is very significant. To beget a child in a godly atmosphere is known in the Vedic scriptures as <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.</span> If the parents want a child in the godly qualities they should follow the ten principles of the human being. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we have studied also before that sex life for begetting a good child is Kṛṣṇa Himself. Sex life is not condemned provided the process is used in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Those who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness at least should not beget children like cats and dogs but should beget them so they may become Kṛṣṇa conscious after birth. That should be the advantage of children born of a mother or father absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The social institution known as <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama dharma,</span> the institution dividing society into four divisions or castes, is not meant to divide human society according to birth. Such divisions are in terms of educational qualifications. They are to keep the society in a state of peace and prosperity. The qualities mentioned herein are explained as transcendental qualities meant for making a person progress in spiritual understanding so he can get liberated from the material world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is that institution to train people to acquire these transcendental qualities? There is no such institution. We are attempting to qualify the man in transcendental qualities. This is the only institution. Otherwise, where it is? I don't think, throughout the whole world, there is any institution to train the students in transcendental qualities. Who cares for transcendental qualities? Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "In the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> institution the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> or the person in the renounced order of life, is considered to be the head or the spiritual master of all the social statuses and orders. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is considered to be the spiritual master of the three other sections of society, namely the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> the <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> and the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> who is on the top of the institution, is considered to be the spiritual master of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> also. For a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> the first qualification should be fearlessness. Because a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> has to be alone without any support or guarantee of support, he has simply to depend on the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If he thinks 'After leaving my connections, who will protect me?' he should not accept the renounced order of life. One must be fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His localized aspect as Paramātmā, is always within, and He is seeing everything, and that He always knows what one intends to do. One must have this firm conviction that Kṛṣṇa as Paramātmā will take care of a soul surrendered unto Him. 'I shall never be alone,' one should think..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Don't divert your attention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> " 'I shall never be alone,' one should think. 'Even if I live in the darkest regions of a forest, I shall be accompanied by Kṛṣṇa, and He will give me all protection.' That conviction is called <span class="Italic">abhayam,</span> 'without fear.' This state of mind is necessary for a person in the renounced order of life. Then he has to purify his existence. There are so many rules and regulations to be followed in the renounced order of life. Most important of all, a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is strictly forbidden to have any intimate relationship with a woman. He is even forbidden to talk with a woman in a secluded place. Lord Caitanya was an ideal <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and when He was at Purī His feminine devotees could not even come near to offer their respects. They were advised to bow down from a distant place. This is not a sign of hatred for women as a class, but it is a stricture imposed on a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> not to have close connections with women. One has to follow the rules and regulations of a particular status of life in order to purify his existence. For a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> intimate relations with a woman and possessions of wealth for sense gratification are strictly forbidden. The ideal <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> was Lord Caitanya Himself, and we can learn from His life that He was very strict in regards to women. Although He is considered to be the most liberal incarnation of Godhead, accepting the most fallen conditioned souls, He strictly followed the rules and regulations of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> order of life in connection with association with women. One of His personal associates, namely Choṭa Haridāsa, was personally associated with Lord Caitanya along with His other confidential personal associates. But somehow or other this Choṭa Haridāsa looked lustfully on a young woman, and Lord Caitanya was so strict that He at once rejected him from the society of His personal associates. Lord Caitanya said, 'For a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> or anyone who is aspiring to get out of the clutches of material nature and trying to elevate himself to the spiritual nature and go back to home, back to Godhead, for him, looking towards material possessions and women for sense gratification-not even enjoying them, but just looking toward them with such a propensity-is so condemned that he had better commit suicide before experiencing such illicit desires.' So these are the processes for purification. The next item is <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga-vyavasthitiḥ:</span> being engaged in the cultivation of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> life is meant for distributing knowledge to the householders and others who have forgotten their real life of spiritual advancement. A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is supposed to beg from door to door for his livelihood, but that does not mean that he is a beggar. Humility is also one of the qualifications of a transcendentally situated person, and out of sheer humility the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> goes from door to door, not exactly for the purpose of begging but to see the householders and awaken them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the duty of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with logic and understanding."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As a gentleman, if you go to somebody's house, you require his permission, but India, still, a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> doesn't require any permission. He can enter in any householder's house: "Mother, give me some food." This is the introduction. Not that he has gone there for food, but easy introduction. And generally the householder will receive a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> "Yes, Swamiji, come here, sit down." They will offer obeisances and then they begin talks. This is the meaning. Not that he is hankering after food. This is only introduction. He's not a beggar. But people take advantage of this dress because they think that "Without any work I can beg and live." That is going on in India. So many rascals, they are taking this <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> dress and living at the cost of others. Therefore people have become disgusted. They have no knowledge to preach. Yes, go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "If he is actually advanced and so ordered by his spiritual master, he should preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness with logic and understanding. And if he is not so advanced, he should not accept the renounced order of life. But even if he has accepted the renounced order of life without sufficient knowledge, he should engage himself fully in hearing from a bona fide spiritual master to cultivate knowledge. A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> or one in the renounced order of life, must be situated in fearlessness, <span class="Italic">sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ</span> (purity), and <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga</span> (knowledge). The next item is charity. Charity is meant for the householders. The householders should earn a livelihood by honorable means and spend fifty percent of their income to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. Thus a householder should give in charity to such institutional societies that are engaged in that way. Charity should be given to the right receiver. There are different kinds of charities, as will be explained later: charity in the modes of goodness, passion and ignorance. Charity in the mode of goodness is recommended by the scriptures, but charity in the modes of passion and ignorance is not recommended, because it is simply a waste of money. Charity should be given only to propagate Kṛṣṇa consciousness all over the world. That is charity in the mode of goodness. Then as far as <span class="Italic">dama</span> (self-control) is concerned, it is not only meant for other orders of religious society, but it is especially meant for the householder. Although he has a wife, the householder should not use his senses for sex life unnecessarily. There are restrictions for the householders even in sex life, which should only be engaged for the propagation of children. If he does not require children, he should not enjoy sex life with his wife. Modern society enjoys sex life with contraceptive methods or more abominable methods to avoid the responsibility of children. This is not in the transcendental quality, but it is demoniac. If anyone, even if he is a householder, wants to make progress in spiritual life, he must control his sex life and should not beget a child without the purpose of serving Kṛṣṇa. If he is able to beget children who will be in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can produce hundreds of children, but without this capacity one should not indulge only for sense pleasure. Sacrifice is another item to be performed by the householders, because sacrifices require a large amount of money. Other orders of life, namely the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> the <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> have no money; they live by begging. So performance of different types of sacrifice is meant for the householder. They should perform <span class="Italic">agni-hotra</span> sacrifices as enjoined in the Vedic literature, but such sacrifices at the present moment are very expensive, and it is not possible for any householder to perform them. The best sacrifice recommended in this age is called <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, this is the best and the most inexpensive sacrifice. Everyone can adopt it and derive benefit. So these three items, namely charity, sense control and performance of sacrifice, are meant for the householder. Then <span class="Italic">svādhyāya</span> (Vedic study), and <span class="Italic">tapas</span> (austerity), and <span class="Italic">ārjavam</span> (gentleness or simplicity) are meant for the <span class="Italic">brahmacarya,</span> or student life. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārīs</span> should have no connection with women; they should live a life of celibacy and engage the mind in the study of Vedic literature for the cultivation of spiritual knowledge. This is called <span class="Italic">svādhyāya. Tapas,</span> or austerity, is especially meant for the retired life. One should not remain a householder throughout his whole life; he must always remember that there are four divisions of life: <span class="Italic">brahmācārya, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So after <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> householder life, one should retire. If one lives for a hundred years, one should spend twenty-five years in student life, twenty-five years in household life, twenty-five in retired life and twenty-five in the renounced order of life. These are the regulations of the Vedic religious discipline. A man retired from household life must practice austerities of the body, mind and tongue. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> The entire <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama dharma</span> society is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Without <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> or austerity, no human being can get liberation. The theory that there is no need of austerity in life, that one can go on speculating and everything will be nice, is neither recommended in the Vedic literature nor in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Such theories are manufactured by show-bottle spiritualists who are trying to gather more followers. If there are restrictions, rules and regulations, people will not become attracted. Therefore those who want followers in the name of religion, just to have a show only, don't restrict the lives of their students, nor their own lives. But that method is not approved by the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> As far as simplicity is concerned, not only should a particular order of life follow this principle, but every member, be he in the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī-āśrama,</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha-āśrama,</span> or <span class="Italic">vānaprastha-āśrama.</span> One must live very simply. <span class="Italic">Ahiṁsā</span> means not arresting the progressive life of any living entity. One should not think that since the spirit spark is never killed even after the killing of the body, there is no harm in killing animals for sense gratification. People are now addicted to eating animals, in spite of having an ample supply of grains, fruits and milk. There is no necessity for animal killing. This injunction is for everyone. When there is no other alternative, one may kill an animal, but it should be offered in sacrifice. At any rate, when there is an ample food supply for humanity, persons who are desiring to make advancement in spiritual realization should not commit violence to animals. Real <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā</span> means not checking anyone's progressive life. The animals are also making progress in their evolutionary life by transmigrating from one category of animal life to another. If a particular animal is killed, then his progress is checked. If an animal is staying in a particular body for so many days or so many years and is untimely killed, then he has to come back again in that form of life to complete the remaining days in order to be promoted to another species of life. So their progress should not checked simply to satisfy one's palate. This is called <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā.</span> <span class="Italic">Satyam:</span> This word means that one should not distort the truth for some personal interest. In Vedic literature there are some difficult passages, but the meaning or the purpose should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. That is the process for understanding the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti</span> means that one should hear from the authority. One should not construe some interpretation for his personal interest. There are so many commentaries on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that misinterpret the original text. The real import of the word should be presented, and that should be learned from a bona fide spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Akrodha</span> means to check anger. Even if there is provocation, one should be tolerant, for once one becomes angry his whole body becomes polluted. Anger is the product of the modes of passion and lust, so one who is transcendentally situated should check himself from anger. <span class="Italic">Apaiśunam</span> means that one should not find fault with others or correct them unnecessarily. Of course, to call a thief a thief is not fault-finding, but to call an honest person a thief is very much offensive for one who is making advancement in spiritual life. <span class="Italic">Hrī</span> me</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">ans that one should be very modest and must not perform some act which is abominable. <span class="Italic">Acāpalam,</span> 'determination,' means that one should not be agitated or frustrated in some attempt. There may be failure in some attempt, but one should not be sorry for that; he should make progress with patience and determination. The word <span class="Italic">tejaḥ</span> used here is meant for the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> should always be very strong to be able to give protection to the weak. They should not pose themselves as nonviolent. If violence is required, they must exhibit it. <span class="Italic">Śaucam</span> means cleanliness, not only in mind and body but in one's dealings also. It is especially meant for the mercantile people, who should not deal in the black market. <span class="Italic">Nāti-mānitā,</span> 'not expecting honor,' applies to the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> the worker class, which are considered, according to Vedic injunctions, to be the lowest of the four classes. They should not be puffed up with unnecessary prestige or honor and should remain in their own status. It is the duty of the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> to offer respect to the higher class for the upkeep of the social order. All these sixteen qualifications mentioned are transcendental qualities. They should be cultivated according to the different statuses of the social order. The purport is that even though material conditions are miserable, if these qualities are developed by practice, by all classes of men, then gradually it is possible to rise to the highest platform of transcendental realization." Text 4.</div>
<div class="Verse">dambho darpo 'bhimānaś ca<br class="calibre2"/>krodhaḥ pāruṣyam eva ca<br class="calibre2"/>ajñānaṁ cābhijātasya<br class="calibre2"/>pārtha sampadam āsurim</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Arrogance, pride, anger, conceit, harshness and ignorance-these qualities belong to those of demoniac nature, O son of Pṛthā." (purport) "In this verse the royal road to hell is described. The demoniac want to make a show of religion and advancement in spiritual science, although they do not follow the principles. They are always arrogant or proud in possessing some type of education or so much wealth. They desire to be worshiped by others, and they demand respectability, although they do not command respect. Over trifles they become very angry and speak harshly, not gently. They do not know what should be done and what should not be done. They do everything whimsically, according to their own desire, and they do not recognize any authority. These demoniac qualities are taken on by them from the very beginning of their bodies in the wombs of their mothers, and as they grow they manifest all these inauspicious qualities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your answer is there. They think liberty means whatever he likes. That is a demoniac person(?). Now discuss this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There's one... You've quoted Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, and he describes a scholar. A scholar is a man who can see all women as his mother, and all living entities, he treats them equally, and other's property as trash. So today's civilization is mistaking a scholar for a rogue and a rogue for a scholar, and here Kṛṣṇa is explaining a godly man, the qualities of a scholar and gentleman, whereas today's civilization is upside down, backwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore preaching is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They feel that godly qualities are a sign of weakness. And the demoniac qualities is a good sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Heroism. That is heroism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes, heroism. In this purport, Śrīla Prabhupāda perfectly describes our student life. As students, we were doing everything whimsically. Or we would accept bad things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja recommends from the beginning of student life, <span class="Italic">kaumāra ācaret prajño dharmān bhāgavatān iha [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> they should be trained up in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That Prahlāda Mahārāja recommends. Now from the very beginning of student life, because there is no education, he is trained up as demon. What can be done? So many things have to be reformed by pushing on Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These are Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, whatever is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that is within the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So we have to do all this.

<div class="Purp-para">"The transcenspurdental qualities are conducive to liberation, whereas the demonic qualities make for bondage. Do not worry, O son of Pāṇḍu, for you are born with the divine qualities." (purport) "Lord Kṛṣṇa encouraged Arjuna by telling him that he was not born with demoniac qualities. His involvement in the fight was not demoniac, because he was considering the pro's and con's. He was considering whether respectable persons such as Bhīṣma and Droṇa should be killed or not, so he was not acting under the influence of anger, false prestige, or harshness. Therefore he was not of the quality of the demons. For a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> a military man, shooting arrows at the enemy is considered transcendental, and refraining from such a duty is demoniac. Therefore, there was no cause for Arjuna to lament. Anyone who performs the regulated principles of the different orders of life is transcendentally situated."</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"O son of Pṛthā, in this world there are two kinds of created beings. One is called the divine and the other demoniac. I have already explained to you at length the divine qualities. Now hear from Me of the demoniac." (purport) "Lord Kṛṣṇa, having assured Arjuna that he was born with the divine qualities, is now describing the demoniac way. The conditioned living entities are divided into two classes in this world. Those who are born with divine qualities follow a regulated life; that is to say they abide by the injunctions in scriptures and by the authorities. One should perform duties in the light of authoritative scripture. This mentality is called divine. One who does not follow the regulative principles as they are laid down in the scriptures and who acts according to his whims is called demoniac, or <span class="Italic">asuric.</span> There is no other criterion but obedience to the regulative principles of scriptures. It is mentioned in Vedic literature that both the demigods and the demons are born of the Prajapati; the only difference is that one class obeys the Vedic injunctions and the other does not."</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Those who are demoniac do not know what is to be done and what is not to be done. Neither cleanliness nor proper behavior nor truth is found in them." Purport. "In every civilized human society there is some set of scriptural rules and regulations which are followed from the beginning, especially among the Aryans, those who adopt the Vedic civilization and who are known as the most advanced civilized peoples. Those who do not follow the scriptural injunctions are supposed to be demons. Therefore it is stated here that the demons do not know the scriptural rules, nor do they have any inclination to follow them. Most of them do not know them, and even if some of them know, they have not the tendency to follow them. They have no faith, nor are they willing to act in terms of Vedic injunctions. The demons are not clean either externally or internally. One should always be very careful to keep his body clean by bathing, brushing teeth, changing clothes, etc. As far as internal cleanliness is concerned, one should always remember the holy names of God and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. The demons neither like nor follow all these rules for external and internal cleanliness. As for behavior, there are many rules and regulations guiding human behavior, such as the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā,</span> which is the lawbook of the human race. Even up to today those who are Hindu follow the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> Laws of inheritance and other legalities are derived from this book. Now, in the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> it is clearly stated that a woman should not be given freedom. That does not mean that women are to be kept as slaves, but they are like children. Children are not given freedom, but that does not mean they are kept as slaves. The demons have now neglected such injunctions and they think that women should be given as much freedom as men. However this has not improved the social condition of the world. Actually a woman should be given protection at every stage of life. She should be given protection by her father in her younger days, by the husband in her youth, and by the grown-up sons in her old age. This is proper social behavior according to the <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> But modern education has artificially devised a puffed-up concept of womanly life, and therefore marriage is practically now an imagination in human society. Nor is the moral condition of woman very good now. The demons, therefore, do not accept any instruction which is good for society, and because they do not follow the experience of great sages and the rules and regulations laid down by the sages, the social condition of the demoniac people is very miserable."</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"They say that this world is unreal, that there is no foundation and that there is no God in control. It is produced of sex desire and has no cause other than lust." Purport. "The demoniac conclude that the world is phantasmagoria. There is no cause, no effect, no controller, no purpose: everything is unreal. They say that this cosmic manifestation arises due to chance material actions and reactions. They do not think that the world was created by God for a certain purpose. They have their own theory that the world has come about in its own way and that there's no reason to believe that there is a God behind it. For them there is no difference between spirit and matter, and they do not accept the supreme spirit. Everything is matter only, and the whole cosmos is supposed to be a mass of ignorance. According to them, everything is void, and whatever manifestation exists is due to our ignorance in perception. They take it for granted that all manifestation of diversity is a display of ignorance. Just as in a dream we may create so many things which actually have no existence, so when we are awake we shall see that everything is simply a dream. But factually, although the demons say that life is a dream, they are very expert in enjoying the dream. And so, instead of acquiring knowledge, they become more and more implicated in their dreamland. They conclude that as a child is simply the result of sexual intercourse between man and woman, this world is born without any soul. For them it is only a combination of matter that has produced the living entities, and there is no question of the existence of the soul. As many living creatures come out from perspiration and from a dead body without any cause, similarly, the whole living world has come out of the material combinations of the cosmic manifestation. Therefore material nature is the cause of this manifestation, and there is no other cause. They do not believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> 'Under My direction the whole material world is moving.' In other words, amongst the demons there is no perfect knowledge of the creation of the world; every one of them has a particular theory of his own. According to them, one interpretation of the scriptures is as good as another, for they do not believe in a standard understanding of the scriptural injunctions."</div>

They have no idea how to behave toward one another. Animal killing is very prominent amongst demoniac people. Such people are considered the enemies of the world because ultimately they will invent or create something which will bring destruction to all. Indirectly, this verse anticipates the invention of nuclear weapons, of which the whole world is today very proud. At any moment war may take place, and these atomic weapons may create havoc. Such things are created solely for the destruction of the world, and this is indicated here. Due to godlessness, such weapons are invented in human society; they are not meant for the peace and prosperity of the world."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Actually, in this century there has not been ten years of peace. Always there is some war been going on, and now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cold war and hot war, they say. When there is fire that is hot war, and there is diplomacy and politics, that is cold war. So war is going on. Sometimes it is hot, sometimes it is cold. There is no peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We even see that among the so-called God conscious communities in the world, still there are such horrible activities going on, fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we don't say that fighting will stop. We are distinguishing demons and rogues, uh, demigods. If you fight, demon, I must defend myself. What can I do? If you start war, you are demon, shall I stop: "No, no, I am demigod, I'll not fight. You kill me"? Is that intelligent? I'll have to fight. But the war starts by the implication of the demons. The Kurukṣetra war, it was not started by Arjuna. It was started by Duryodhana. (long pause) All right, go on.</div>

<div class="Verse">kāmam āśritya duṣpūram<br class="calibre2"/>dambha-māna-madānvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mohād gṛhītvāsad-grāhān<br class="calibre2"/>pravartante 'śuci-vratāḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"The demoniac, taking shelter of insatiable lust, pride and false prestige, and being thus illusioned, are always sworn to unclean work, attracted by the impermanent." Purport. "The demoniac mentality is described here. The demons' lust is never satiated. They will go on increasing and increasing their insatiable desires for material enjoyment. Although they are always full of anxieties on account of accepting nonpermanent things, they still continue to engage in such activities out of illusion. They have no knowledge and cannot tell that they are heading the wrong way. Accepting nonpermanent things, such demoniac people create their own God, create their own hymns, and chant accordingly. The result is that they become more and more attracted to two things-sex enjoyment and accumulation of material wealth. The word <span class="Italic">aśuci-vratāḥ,</span> 'unclean vow,' is very significant in this connection. Such demoniac people are only attracted by wine, women, gambling and meat-eating; those are their <span class="Italic">aśuci,</span> unclean habits. Induced by pride and false prestige, they create some principles of religion which are not approved by the Vedic injunctions. Although such demoniac people are most abominable in the world, still, by artificial means, the world creates a false honor for them. Although they are gliding toward hell, they consider themselves very much advanced."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many religious systems: "Yes, you can do whatever you like, you can eat whatever you like," and still it is religion. This is demoniac. That will be explained further.

They do not know what to do, what to not do. Because they do not take any standard idea. They manufacture their own ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> In the Catholic Church, they used to have the doctrine, "No eating meat on Friday." Used to be standard, no meat-eating on Friday; they would only eat fish. Now within our lifetime they have changed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They have changed so many things. When I was a young boy they..., you had to be in church on Sunday morning very early, otherwise it was noticed. Now you don't have to be till later on. There is no more austerity in religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if their standard is demoniac to begin with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are selling churches. Nobody is attracted. In London city there are so many churches closed. Nobody goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In Cleveland, also, Prabhupāda, there are so many churches, only five, ten, fifteen people attend, and they are all elderly, elderly ladies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Due to the Pope's taking a firm stand over the not allowing abortion and contraception, like this, they said that the number of practicing Catholics was reduced from seventy-five percent to fifty percent, just simply because of that one principle that he'd stuck to. So twenty-five percent immediately left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where they have gone? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they gave up going to church at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Hopeless life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why hopeless? There is hope-Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hopeless for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This very much describes modern civilization also. They are such <span class="Italic">aśuci-vratāḥ,</span> they are given much respect in modern-day society. And the devotees, sometimes we go preaching and put into jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very fortunate they are not crucifying you. Putting into jail, but they crucified Lord Jesus Christ, they were so intelligent. Because he was preaching God consciousness, he was crucified. What was his fault? He was talking of God, therefore he was crucified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Now they only take our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> collection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Now they are just taking our collection. Today two of my boys, they were arrested just north of here. So as a fine they have taken their <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> collection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Robbing. In the name of law, robbing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Right, the court has taken it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Did this happen in court or the police...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhrtadyumna:</span> In court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then they let go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They were let go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They just want some revenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are robbing, government, <span class="Italic">dasyu dharmabhiḥ.</span> It is stated, government will be like rogues. As the rogues and thieves, they take away from you by force, the government will do that. In the court, by income tax, so many people are being harassed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> There is a large organization called Mafia in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mafia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Mafia, organized criminals, organized like businessmen. They are controlling the politicians by money. But although they are exposing, still it goes on. It is worse than ever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Explain further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The Mafia is an organization that was originally coming from Sicily. They were an organized group of men that would control all the politics in the area by manipulation of money and businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And violence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And violence. So many things they'd do. They used to organize all the heroin that comes into the country, like this, for revenue, to get revenue, money. So many things. And places like Las Vegas, which is a big gambling city, that is also run by the Mafia. They control all the casinos and they control the police, they pay everyone off, like that, and if they don't agree, they kill them. So like this, their influence is spread everywhere, any illegal things that are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Terrorism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Our last President, two Presidents ago, Kennedy, he was involved with one of their prostitutes. She was getting information, and he was not investigating them because he was involved with one of their prostitutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They keep prostitutes also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Oh, yes, they use them. Actually, they are controlling many of these judges, and then we are coming in, and we are preaching the other thing, no prostitution, no drinking, and then we are getting fines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If the natural tendency of the living entity is to want to exist, to live, then why is it they perform so many horrible acts that will destroy themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are thinking that they will exist in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it that they see everyone as their enemy, and therefore everything has to be around them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is foolishness. Everyone wants to exist, struggle for existence, but they do not know how to exist. That is foolishness. Everyone wants to exist because actually he is eternal. He doesn't like to be destroyed. That is his natural inclination. But he does not know. We are giving the formula that if you want to exist, then you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are giving the right information. But they want to exist in their wrong way of existing. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Why is it that the demon, he feels happy if someone else is distressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Why does the demoniac mentality, that they feel happy if they see someone else in distress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are demons. That is demonic mentality. They are happy when others are unhappy. And when others are happy, they are unhappy. That is demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They are thinking "I am not so happy, but these others, they are suffering more, so therefore I am okay."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is general demonic feeling. If you are unhappy, then I am happy. And if you are happy, then I am unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> The devotee is described as <span class="Italic">para-duḥkha-duḥkhi.</span> He's only distressed in seeing the distress of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's song is there, <span class="Italic">para-duḥkhe sukhi.</span> That is natural. Go on.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"They believe that to gratify the senses unto the end of life is the prime necessity of human civilization. Thus there is no end to their anxiety. Being bound by hundreds and thousands of desires, by lust and anger, they secure money by illegal means for sense gratification."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illegal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Illegal means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Purport. "The demoniac accept that the enjoyment of the senses is the ultimate goal of life, and this concept they maintain until death. They do not believe in life after death, and they do not believe that one takes on different types of bodies according to one's <span class="Italic">karma,</span> or activities in this world. Their plans for life are never finished, and they go on preparing plan after plan, all of which are never finished. We have personal experience of a person of such demoniac mentality, who, even at the point of death, was requesting the physician to prolong his life for four years more because his plans were not yet complete. Such foolish people do not know that a physician cannot prolong life even for a moment. When the notice is there, there is no consideration of the man's desire. The laws of nature do not allow a second beyond what one is destined to enjoy. The demoniac person, who has no faith in God or the Supersoul within himself, performs all kinds of sinful activities simply for sense gratification. He does not know that there is a witness sitting within his heart. The Supersoul is observing the activities of the individual soul. As it is stated in the Vedic literature, the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> there are two birds sitting in one tree; the one is acting and enjoying or suffering the fruits of the branches, and the other is witnessing. But one who is demoniac has no knowledge of Vedic scripture, nor has he any faith; therefore he feels free to do anything for sense enjoyment, regardless of the consequences."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He became like a hermit. He withdrew into himself.
