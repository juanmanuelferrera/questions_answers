<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car:) ...and artificially they construct big, big cities. Wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Wrong turn we made back at the beginning of the street. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...coming. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This is more pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In a newspaper report, Śrīla Prabhupāda, about India, it said that the mass of people in the rural areas didn't even know that there was an emergency rule. They don't... It's so peaceful. They're not affected. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of people, they do not care for these political things. Even in Gandhi's strong civil disobedience movement, out of the whole population of India, only sixty-thousand men joined. What is the India's population?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Six hundred million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six hundred million, and out of that sixty-thousand joined, and it became successful. Sixty thousand joined by statistics. Actually worker, I don't think more than ten thousand people. Exactly like Indian village. Here there is no business. They simply reside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. [break] (outside:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...it's over there somewhere. He's one of the world's richest men, H. L. Hunt. He's a Dallas oil millionaire. Some devotees tried to approach him, but at his house he has servants and... At least the servant took a <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They couldn't see the man himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayananda:</span> He died. A few months ago. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...otogrika?</span> (?) Similar like that. [break] <span class="Italic">...dollars?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. That means about four thousand a month. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of man, why? Why this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because the men are exploiting them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the fact. They are dissatisfied with the treatment of man. The grievance is that they do not get husband, home, children, like loitering on the street. That is their aspiration: they want good home, good husband, good children. That they are not getting. Oh, it is a very big lake. (end)</div>
