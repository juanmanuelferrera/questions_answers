<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...discussing some subject matter from <span class="Italic">Reader's Digest</span> about the next two hundred years, how things will happen, the scientist proposing that they'll control the laws of nature, and they will produce food from garbage, so many fantastic ideas. But our suggestion, according to Caitanya Mahāprabhu,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">[break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a very bad picture. It makes the devotees look very strange. And they have this elaborate ghee holder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. This is at an <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> You can see the donations that people have put on the tray. But it makes it look very strange, this picture with the lighting. They have deliberately selected this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very big article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. I have just been reading it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What newspaper is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's a very small-time newspaper called the <span class="Italic">Soho Weekly News.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And bad propaganda is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Some good, some bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are two. Any movement will have such.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> So I mentioned this morning about Sumati Satetur(?), Mr. Hoksa Buddhi,(?) that he was considering becoming a devotee. So I told him you were here, so he immediately came tonight. He's waiting now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So then bring him. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So I can read this and summarize it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...if there is anything interesting. But this is something that's nice. [break] ...this one first. This is the total sales.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the largest sale. (chuckling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> 487,000 <span class="Italic">Perfection of Yoga,</span> 263,000 <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Is Authorized,</span> 10,000 cook books, Hare Kṛṣṇa Cook books, 4,000 <span class="Italic">Gopal</span> coloring books, and just under 7,000..., excuse me, 7,000,000 <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazines.

So the total literatures sold last year is 9,076,280 literatures. Nine million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> It's only English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is just English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) ...French, German, Dutch, Swedish, Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Chinese. (Bengali) We want. (Bengali) Person to person... (Bengali) Huge organization. (Bengali) ...Bhaktivedanta Book Trust... (Bengali)... stock, distribution, salesmen control. (Bengali) ...Delhi paper... (Bengali) We have got substance. (Bengali) So it is very encouraging, this report. What else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now the next two reports. First of all, for the month of December there's the ratings for the whole Society. So in the top ten, number one was New York, Rādhā-Dāmodara, with $170,000. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Give him some book to read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Where's the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (Indian man):</span> I should have some basic knowledge about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives basic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Number two was Los Angeles with $87,000. Number three was Berkeley with $85,000. Number four was San Diego, $62,000. Caracas, 60,000, Brazil and England tied-$48,000. Germany 33,000; Denver 32,000; and Pittsburgh 30,000. And the medium temples weren't so outstanding, but the small temple, Houston, little Houston, $25,000. They only have about twelve men. I cannot understand how hard they worked to do this, very hard. Plus it shows Gurukṛpa's donation, ISKCON food relief donation. Then the outstanding zones for the month. Number one is Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, with $200,000. Number two was my zone. Actually it's your zone, but you've made me manage it a little. $182,000, very close to beating him. (Prabhupāda chuckles) Actually I have noticed that if the West Coast was not divided this year into two zones... Formerly it was just one zone. All Berkeley, it was one zone. Now it is two zones. So I noticed that if it had not been divided, then every month the West Coast would have been number one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Combined together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. Then Hṛdayānanda was number three with $155,000. That is very good for Latin America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And number four was the Northwest West Coast. That's the other half of the West Coast, with $122,000. Then fifth was $89,000. Which is very good for three temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So the next thing is the entire year, the ratings for the whole year. So number one for zones is Tamāla Kṛṣṇa-$1,000,000 for the whole year. Number two was the area that I have: Los Angeles, Denver and San Diego-$762,000. Number three is Balavanta-$476,000. And number four was the other half of the West Coast-$464,000. You can see that if you put the West Coast as one it would have been $1,200,000 to Tamāla Kṛṣṇa's $1,000,000. But anyway, it's been divided, so he has won. So he's also... New York temple is number one among temples, and his zone is number one among zones. So he has set the whole standard for the whole movement in book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> My zone is all <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> (laughs) with a few <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> Anyway, next year we can beat Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. (Prabhupāda chuckles) He has only beaten us by a few hundred thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But don't tell him now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Or it may be ruined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may be very careful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think we should send him a congratulations letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Yes. You send.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I'll send him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Yes. To entice him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is his main...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually in the beginning, for increasing the sale, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa gave the impetus. He was selling best in San Francisco. Then went from... What is that? We were printing in the beginning? What is the press called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ISKCON Press?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I purchased some hand press?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Letterpress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, it has got special name. I forget now. I purchased two presses, $150.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mimeograph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mimeograph. <span class="Italic">Ha ha ha.</span> So we were selling about five hundred copies, and gradually... But still, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was selling almost major portion. Then I asked Brahmānanda that "Why not print?" So he took quotation from different printers, and Dai Nippon, we gave them, printing, this <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span> So he took quotation, ten cents per copy. But they want twenty thousand. So we were selling about one thousand, and it is a question of twenty thousand. So I consulted Tamāla in San Francisco. So he gave me some encourage. I asked Brahmānanda, "Yes, print twenty thousand." So from five hundred to twenty thousand, great jump. Somehow or other, it began like that. Now what we are printing per month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What? Hardbound books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> 750,000. It is averaging like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the first attempt was only 20,000. I calculated. Anyway, Kṛṣṇa is giving us all facility. Let us utilize it to the best of our capacity. We have no other ambition. We want to see that everyone may accept the Supreme Personality of Godhead and be happy. This is our mission. We have no other ambition, not to make any cost-profit. But when we see that so many people are reading Kṛṣṇa book, that gives us very good encouragement. Otherwise what...? Two <span class="Italic">capatis</span> we can get anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We wrote in the newsletter to the Society that even though our movement is being attacked is so many ways, the best counterattack is through book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the best answer to this opposition. And when the case is there, put all the books before the judge: "Now you read and give your judgment. Don't... You are learned lordship. Please read these books and give your judgment. We have got already judgment from the scholars." Present like that. "But still, because in your court it is presented, so we pray that you give your judgment after understanding our method of brainwash." That will make him flat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And we gave this proof, another proof that our movement is transcendental to all material obstacles and impediments, that this year in America there was spiraling inflation and unemployment, and the cost of living was therefore rising like anything, but our books, in defiance of all these material trends, were being printed in larger quantities, but the temples were paying less for the books than ever before. And even though all the major airports were closed for, a minimum, six months or more, the hardbound book distribution-we just looked at the numbers-actually increased by one hundred percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is Kṛṣṇa's mercy. "You can do all kinds of opposition, but we shall go forward. The caravan will pass. You may bark." So take all these things as Kṛṣṇa's mercies and engage more enthusiastically. Why should we be defeated? <span class="Italic">Yuddhyasva mām anusmara [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">].</span> Just remember Kṛṣṇa and fight. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> Fighting is... This material world is fighting. <span class="Italic">Manaḥ ṣaṣṭhānīndriyāṇi prakṛti-sthāni karṣati [Bg.<b class="calibre4"> </b></span>15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">karṣati</span> is struggle, but struggle for Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection. That's all</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. Work very hard for Kṛṣṇa one life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You may like to see these, so I can leave them here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have heard it. <span class="Italic">Śruta.</span> It is <span class="Italic">śuśruma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When these come out, I frame them on my wall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our method is <span class="Italic">iti śuśruma:</span> "I have heard it." That's all. (end)</div>
