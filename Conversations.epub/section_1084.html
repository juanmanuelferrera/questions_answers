<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Life Member, Mr. Malhotra<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 22, 1976, Poona</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you cannot do like this. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Nobody is superior than Me." That is Kṛṣṇa. Are you able to become superior of everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> That is so, but how is that creator. His own creation went against and Kṛṣṇa became after His creation to worship and become devotees of superior...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) For this reason Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">janma karma ca me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who knows what are the activities of Kṛṣṇa he is liberated. So</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So to understand Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ,</span> it is not possible for ordinary person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Why this trying to understand Kṛṣṇa? Why not try to understand one's self? Kṛṣṇa passed 5000 years ago. Now ashes are there in our hands. Why not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore you do not know what is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is... Why Kṛṣṇa? You are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. You are <span class="Italic">nitya, nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, you are <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> Why do you say Kṛṣṇa existed 5000 years ago? He is existing always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Always existing there. (indistinct) Within you, within oneself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. You are also <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> but you are part and parcel of that <span class="Italic">nitya. Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> God is <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> you are also <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> God is also living, you are also living. What is the difference between the two? That one person He is maintaining all of us. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> So this is knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. God is one. I am also individual. But we are many because we are all living entities. But God is one. We are controlled by God or God's nature. We are not one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Aren't we the images of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from images... That is another thing. That we shall describe later on. First of all you cannot claim that you are God because you are under the control of material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> You said part and parcel of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Part and parcel, just like the finger is part and parcel of my body, but it is not the whole body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> It is the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is body, you can say that, but part of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Part of my body. All enjoined together, it makes the whole body. If it is separated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But still you say it is <span class="Italic">aṅguli</span> [finger]. It is not the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṅguli.</span> (Laughs) It is one part, to say many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You should be, should be senses. Just like this <span class="Italic">aṅguli,</span> I am asking, "Do like this." It is my servant. After all, it is part of the body, it is my servant. If it cannot serve my body then it is diseased. Similarly we are part and parcel of God. If we cannot serve God, that is our diseased condition. The same example. This finger is part and parcel of my body. But I ask finger, "Please come here, to my nostrils." If it cannot do, then it is diseased. It is not in normal condition. So anyone who does not serve the whole, part and whole, he is diseased. He is not in normal condition. <span class="Italic">Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya kṛṣṇera dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore because we have forgotten this relationship with God, declared ourself as God, that is diseased condition. Therefore God comes and He orders, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Surrender unto Me. Don't talk nonsense." That is God. So when we agree, that is our perfection. Not to artificially become God, but to agree to serve God. That is liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> So what if the drop submerges in ocean, then the identity of drop vanishes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Drop, when drop submerges with the ocean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will give you practical example. Just like you take red water, colored water. So put into the sea, does this mean that sea becomes red? That little spot may be for the time being. Besides that, merging, this is the philosophy of the Māyāvādīs. Actually that is superficial. Just like a bird, green bird, enters into the green tree. You see that bird is vanished. Because the tree is green and the bird is green, you do not know the separate identification. But the bird is there, separate identification. It is not the bird has become zero. A airplane goes to the sky, after some time you don't find the airplane. That doesn't mean the airplane has no more identity, separate. It is separate. It is your defective eyes that you cannot see, that it has got separate existence. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that, "I, you and all these kings who are assembled here, we existed in the past, we are now existing, and we shall exist in the future." That means individual existence will continue. He explains past, present and future. So where is imagination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No imagination. But <span class="Italic">paraṁ pada</span> that is <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa,</span> or whatever...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">paraṁ pada</span> is just like you fly in the sky, go very high. So from here we cannot see that you are separately existing. But you are separately existing. It is my deficient eyes that I see that you are not separate. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Identification will remain always?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Always. Therefore it is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra, āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">, ye 'nye 'ravindākṣa vimukta-māninaḥ...</span> It is said, "My Lord, the lotus-eyed, <span class="Italic">vimukta-mānina,</span> if somebody artificially is thinking that he has become liberated or merged into the existence, <span class="Italic">āruhya kṛcchreṇa,</span> for which he has undergone very severe <span class="Italic">tapasya," āruhya kṛcchreṇa... Kṛcchreṇa</span> means with great difficulty. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ padam, brahmajyoti, patanti adhaḥ,</span> "again he falls down," <span class="Italic">anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ...</span> Just like these rascals that are going in the sky to find out a place in the Mars and in the Moon. And why they are coming back? If actually one has gone, then why he's coming back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> To tells to others that they saw something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Similarly you will find the so-called <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> not <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> they undergo severe austerities, penances, but after some time they come to the worldly atmosphere. Because they could not get any place, therefore they come down. Just like the Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> they say that this <span class="Italic">duniyā,</span> [world] <span class="Italic">jagat mithyā.</span> If <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> you have left it, then why you come again to give some philanthropic service? If it is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> then why you come again after so much? Is it not nonsense? If <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> why you are coming again to this <span class="Italic">mithyā?</span> That means you could not get place in the <span class="Italic">satya.</span> Therefore you come down again. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padam [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Although with severe austerities and penances (he) might go to the <span class="Italic">paraṁ pada, patanty adhaḥ, anādṛta-yuṣmad,</span> because he could not get shelter at the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord, he falls down. He must fall down to the material activities. <span class="Italic">Patanty adhaḥ.</span> That is <span class="Italic">adho patha.</span> As soon as a person, after undergoing severe austerities, becomes very highly elevated in the <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> stage, but if he cannot get shelter at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then surely he shall fall down for these material activities, material enjoyment. That is the sign that he's fallen down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa we have to see in a personal way, have to see the entirety as the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirākāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> He says <span class="Italic">"aham,"</span> every sentence in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> He says <span class="Italic">"aham."</span> So how He is <span class="Italic">nirākāra?</span> Just like you, you are a person. When you say "I, I can do this," that is a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Because I have no other alternative but to communicate. I can communicate only, I and you. There is no other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No other way, therefore you are deficient. You cannot claim that you are God. Because you have no other way. You are forced by something. So somebody is controller upon you. Therefore you are different from the God. As you say, "I have no other way," that means you are dependent (on) something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But God can communicate differently?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore God and you are different. That is <span class="Italic">dvaita-vāda.</span> You are different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Why at all this started? Why at all, say millions, trillions years back, how it started that God created this world? Then all are one and different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God is there. So God, you are created or you are subordinate to God? You are also there. So <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> you are also existing eternally, and God is also eternally existing. But the difference between you and God is that God is maintaining everything and you are being maintained. That is the difference. You are one of the items which is maintained by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> As long as I continue my identity that "I am so and so, I am this body," or "I am a person, or <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> seated in this body, or dwelling in this body," when I dislodge my body from <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> then what is the position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are different from the body. You are different from the body. You are soul. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> The body is temporary, you are eternal. <span class="Italic">Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are <span class="Italic">nityaḥ śāśvata.</span> You are never killed even after the destruction of the body. That should... That is real understanding, that I am not this body. After annihilation of this body, I shall continue. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> You should know that you are eternal part and parcel of God. God is eternal. Just like gold and a small particle of gold, both of them are gold. A small particle of gold, it is also gold, but not equal to the gold mine. That is real understanding. And because you are little gold...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But potentiality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potential different, because a lump of gold and a small particle of gold, the value is not the same. Gold it is quality, but not the value the same. That you cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Qualitative it is gold, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But quantity it is different. God is all-pervading. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> God is all-pervading, He is in everyone's heart. Can you live in everyone's heart? Can you know what I am thinking? Then how you can become God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Well there are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are fools, rascals. There are others. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But there are certain people who say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who says, they are rascals. They are rascals. We take them as rascals, that's all. How you can say that you are all-pervading? Can you say that? Even if you are very highly elevated, can you say what I am thinking? Then how do you claim God? God is all-pervading. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 13.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> There are two <span class="Italic">kṣetras-jñas.</span> One <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña,</span> just like I am, you are. They are <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jña.</span> I know about my pains and pleasures of my body. You know. But I do not know what is pains and pleasure of your body. You do not know what is pains and pleasure of my body. Therefore there is difference. But God knows. That is the difference between you and God. How you claim God? You do not know what is the pains and pleasures of my body. You know the pains and pleasure of your body. I know the pains and pleasure of my body. But either you or me, we do not know the pains and pleasures of all bodies. And Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> He knows everyone's pains and pleasure. That is the difference between you and Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But this is all right. As long as I maintain my identity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to... If you foolishly think that you have become one, that is your foolishness. Yes. That is foolish thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> If I submerge myself with the entire...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Merge means you do not disagree. That is merge. Do not disagree. Just like when Arjuna was disagreeing, that is his condition, that is his conditioned identity, and when he agreed, "Yes, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">,</span>"that is identity of oneness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender, that is oneness. Not that individually he has become different. Individually he is, but he does not disagree with Kṛṣṇa. That is oneness. Just like we are sitting, we are of different interests. But so far my disciples are, they will not disagree with me. That is oneness. But he is individual. He was individual, he is individual and he will continue his individuality. But as soon as he accepts me as the leader, then he is agreement. That is oneness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Agreement with God is surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> To serve Kṛṣṇa favorably, that is oneness. That is oneness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> This is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any yoga. You are individual, God is individual. That is already explained, I told you. God says, Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, "Me, yourself and all these people who have gathered, they are all individuals. They were individuals in the past, they are individuals now, and we shall continue to remain individuals in the future."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Even if we surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender means agreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Agreement. Individuality will all along exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise why is he asking, "You surrender," unless there is individuality? Why this request is there? Because you are individual, you can deny it. That individuality continues. But if you have love for God, then you agree, "Yes, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">."</span> So that is wanted. Not that he lost his individuality. Individuality is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Individuality remains. It seems so, that the individuality remains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is the fact, Kṛṣṇa says. What Kṛṣṇa says you have to accept. Otherwise, what is the use of reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> You cannot accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> through your whims. That is nonsense. You must accept as it is. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> This Satya Sai Baba, he is also disciple of Kṛṣṇa. How he produces...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if he is disciple of Kṛṣṇa, he would not have foolishly said that he is Bhagavān. That means he is bogus. It is bogus... You cannot say... You are disciple... Just like they are my disciples. They will never say that they are equal to me. They will never say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No, no, but what power he has got to produce just now...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That anyone can do, magic, jugglery. It has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> He got you know this money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he can get anything, but that is... Magic. That is... Magician also knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Professor Sarkar, a big magician, he kills, cuts people's body, then he joins them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things. Magic jugglery is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But there are some <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> also. These <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> <span class="Italic">siddhis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> magic also <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> You are successful businessman, that is also <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> That is also <span class="Italic">siddhi. Yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> Even one is <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> he cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. That is said, <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> Even one is <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> still he cannot understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But if he goes to <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> where and everybody sits there, the big Kṛṣṇa statue is there. In his room personal room Kṛṣṇa statue...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is at all devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he will never say that he is Bhagavān. That is foolishness. That very assertion is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But Bhagavān, they don't call them Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they write in the books. They don't call, but write in the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was one article in the Blitz where they quoted him saying, God is man and man is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said he is the incarnation for this age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is the evidence? Anyone can say, "I am incarnation." (laughter) Any rascal can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Anyone can say. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the proof? Just like this Ramakrishna, he was an illiterate priest, and at the time of his death he said to Vivekananda, that I am Kṛṣṇa, I am Lord Rāma, and he accepted. He accepted. (Hindi conversation) Let him create one motorcar. Why he's asking, "Please sir, give me car." That's all. He is such a great man; bogus. People are foolish persons, they are deviated by these bogus rascals. That is going on. (Hindi conversation) <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇam.</span> (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Then he is servant, always servant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Nityānām, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaḥ...</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) That is his foolishness. And foolish person will accept. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore He shall remain the Supreme always. We have to refer to the Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstras. Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.</span> This is description of Bhagavān. That He has nothing to do, <span class="Italic">na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.</span> (Hindi) (Explains in Hindi that Kṛṣṇa does not need or show any magic, when He was just a child He killed Pūtanā. Not that by meditation He became God. Bhagavān is always Bhagavān.) Either he is three months old or three years old or three hundred years old. <span class="Italic">Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate,</span> nobody can be equal or greater than Him. If someone is equal to Him then how He is Bhagavān?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> How it can be that so many sages of the past, they proclaimed <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brahman (Hindi). You are Brahman. Because you are part and parcel of Parabrahman. That I have already told you. That gold, big gold and small particle, that is gold. Similarly, Bhagavān Parabrahman, and we are part and parcel of Him. Therefore I am Brahman. But I am not Parabrahman. Kṛṣṇa is accepted as Parabrahman by Arjuna: <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Parabrahman. So <span class="Italic">param,</span> this word is used, Paramātmā, Parabrahman, Parameśvara. Why? That is the difference. One is supreme and one is subordinate. Subordinate Brahman. You are Brahman, there is no doubt of it. But not that Parabrahman. If you are Parabrahman, then why you are making <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> to become Parabrahman? Why? If you are Parabrahman, then you are Parabrahman always. Why you have fallen in this condition that you have to perform <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> to become Parabrahman? That is foolishness. You are not Parabrahman. You are Brahman. You are gold, a small particle. But you cannot say that "I am gold mine." That you cannot do. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he is checking if it is time to go on... Are you going to come with us also? Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring little water. These, my disciples they are part and parcel of me. Whole mission is going on with their cooperation. But if he says that I am equal to my Guru Mahārāja, then that is offense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Suppose guru desires that my disciple should rise higher than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he is in lower stage. That you have to accept first of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Like as a father sees that his children grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, still father begets father, and a child cannot become father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Father begets father but he feels that he may, will progress...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Father may want to see that the son is equally qualified, but still the father is father, and child is child. That is perpetual. Similarly, a part and parcel of God may be very powerful, but that does not mean that he has become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Other traditions, guru disciple, then the disciple becomes guru, then disciple. The gurus may change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot change. If there are change of guru, the disciple acts, but does not, he'll never say that I have become equal or one with guru. That is not so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> I am thinking about this, Swamiji, that your Guru Mahārāja is preaching through you, and you are preaching through them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> So disciple is guru through his disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> But that does not become, he has become. He may be representative of guru, representative of God, but it does not mean that he has become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But he becomes guru with his disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's alright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Never equal to his guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not equal, representative. I send one representative of this man, and he may be very expert, doing very good business, still he cannot be equal to me. He is acting as my representative, that's another thing. But not that he has become the original proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But as your disciples, you are taken as guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they will never say that they have become equal to me. "I have advanced to be my guru." Never say. Just like this boy, he is offering obeisances. He may be expert in preaching more than me, but he knows that "I am subordinate." Otherwise how he shall offer obeisances? He can think, "Oh, now I am so learned. I am so advanced. Why shall I accept him as superior?" No. That continues. Even after my death, after my disappearance, he will offer obeisances to my picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But amongst his disciples he will be worshiped...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but he remains a disciple of his guru. He will never say that "Now I have become guru, so I don't care for my guru." He will never say. Just like I am doing, but I am worshiping my guru still. So I remain subordinate to my guru, always. Even though I have become guru, still I am subordinate to my guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But qualitatively...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Qualitatively equal I have already said. Not quantitatively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Qualitatively we are one. Quantitatively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Do you think a grain of gold and a big gold lump is same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Gold, I think I am also gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, gold that is accepted, quality. That if you say, this is explanation. You must have brain to understand. That a small particle of gold and a big gold, they are gold in quality but the big gold is millions of dollars and a small particle is few dollars. Just see this is accepted. This Māyāvāda theory has made people atheists, that "I am God, I am equal to God." Very bad theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> From where these things also come? From where it comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Vedas</span> says, <span class="Italic">na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate, Upaniṣads. Na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate, parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate svā-bhāvikī jñāna-bala-kriyā ca [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Who gives this <span class="Italic">asura-buddhi?</span> From where this filth grows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Asura-buddhi</span> and <span class="Italic">sura-buddhi.</span> Due to our little independence. Just like we are talking. So we do not agree. Therefore we are talking. So one of us may be <span class="Italic">asura</span> and one may be <span class="Italic">sura.</span> Therefore we do not agree. Otherwise, there is no use of talking. So that is natural. That is the conditioned stage. Because we are conditioned by the material nature, some of us are <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and some of them <span class="Italic">suras. Dvau bhūta-sargau loke 'smin daiva āsura eva ca</span> [Bg. 16.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are two kinds of men. <span class="Italic">Daiva, devatā</span> and <span class="Italic">asura.</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ smṛto daiva āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ.</span> Those who are devotees of the Lord, they are <span class="Italic">devatā,</span> and just opposite number is <span class="Italic">asura.</span> Who does not recognize the authority of God, he is <span class="Italic">asura.</span> He himself becomes God foolishly. That is not God. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ. Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā.</span> This, about the sun, description in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā. Yac-cakṣur eṣa savitā sakala-grahāṇāṁ rājā samasta-sura-mūrtir aśeṣa-tejāḥ. Aśeṣa-tejāḥ,</span> unlimited potency, energy, heating energy. Such a powerful planet. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati saṁbhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.</span> Still it is carrying out the order of somebody. <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> I offer my obeisances to Govinda. But if I say I am equal to Govinda, I can stop sun. "Don't bother me by heating. Stop." Will it become...? Then how I become all-powerful? Let me stop the activities of the sun. Or at night there is no sun, can I ask the sun, "Get up, I want light immediately," is it possible? Then how I become the God? Nobody cares for my order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> They say those who know their <span class="Italic">bhāgavata,</span> they call themselves Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That anyone can say that I know my Bhagavān, nobody knows. I am Bhagavān but nobody cares for me. What kind of Bhagavān? It is rascal Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When Bhagavān has a toothache he goes to the dentist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when there's a toothache he goes to the doctor. These kind of nonsense has to be stopped. Otherwise people become atheists. "Anyone can become God, anyone can become Bhagavān."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> This Rajneesh I tell you, he has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't say about Rajneesh because I have no acquaintance with him, but anyone says that he is Bhagavān, he can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Somebody asked him, "Why you claim to be God or Bhagavān?" He clarified that "It is not the creator or the the equal Bhagavān. I know by, I have realized by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But God says I am the creator of everything. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can go, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We will go to the car. (Śrīla Prabhupāda goes out) [break] (in car:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to the sun planet, beginning is the sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Yes, beginning in the sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly to go to the Absolute Truth, you begin with impersonal Brahman. Just as sunshine is impersonal, but everyone can see the sunshine is coming from the sun surface. Everyone knows that. Therefore the sunshine is not so important as the sunglobe. Similarly <span class="Italic">brahma-tattva-nirviśeṣa, nirākāra-brahma</span> is there, but more important than is the localized aspect. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna [Bg. 18.61],</span> God is all-pervading. The sunshine is all-pervading, and as Paramātmā He is also all-pervading. But if you can enter into the sunglobe, you will meet with the sun god. Just like Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I spoke this philosophy to the sun-god." So there is sun-god. Sun-god and the sun globe and the sunshine, they are one. But different stages of understanding. Similarly, Brahman understanding, Paramātmā understanding, then the Supreme Personality of Godhead understanding. <span class="Italic">Advaya-jñāna. Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> But if you stop simply in the sunshine, that means you have no knowledge of the sun god or the sun globe. If you have simply knowledge of the sun globe, then you are not aware of what is the sun-god. But if you know sun-god, then you know what is sun globe and the sunshine. That is wanted. That is perfect knowledge. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When, after many many births, when one is actually in knowledge, he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, understanding that Kṛṣṇa is everything, that <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is <span class="Italic">sudurlabha,</span> very rare. Somebody knows only impersonal Brahman, the <span class="Italic">jñānīs.</span> Somebody knows the Paramātmā, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe [Bg. 18.61].</span> And one who knows Kṛṣṇa he is perfect. [break] ...this stage of understanding Kṛṣṇa, your knowledge is imperfect. [break] <span class="Italic">...śāstras,</span> but unfortunately we do not refer to the authority of the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> We manufacture our own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No actually what has happened is that there has been too many interpretations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There cannot be interpretations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No, there are certain people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> That is what I said, huh. So there are so many interpretations that you get confused. Because of the same thing, some interpret it a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thing is that you have to become intelligent. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> Now why I shall accept interpretation on these plain words? That is my foolishness. If somebody says <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra</span> means this body and Pāṇḍava means the five senses, why this nonsense interpretation? If you are not intelligent, then you will accept such rascals interpreting unnecessarily. Interpretation is required when things are not very clear. But when the things are clear, why you should accept interpretation? That is my foolishness. There is no need of interpretation. [break] ...is it still there? Why, if the rascal interprets Kurukṣetra means this body, why shall I accept it? Kurukṣetra is still there. There is no difficulty to understand. And if somebody interprets... [break] ...interpretation, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that as soon as you interpret, the whole thing is lost. So why shall I be so foolish, I shall accept something which is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No. Rather Kṛṣṇa had His own interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be but why shall I accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> ...had his own interpretation rather. All the people who show...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have, interpretation, you have to refer to the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā</span> says as soon as you accept interpretation it is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Then the meaning is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> So under the circumstances... That means I am also foolish. Any rascal gives any interpretation-I accept. That is my foolishness. So why should I become foolish? Radhakrishnan may be very big man, but if he does something wrong, he will be hanged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No, he, <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> are there. All the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā ślokas</span> are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I must have intelligence that why this rascal is interpreting in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> And Sanskrit is the language. So it has got the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is not very difficult. Just like in the Ninth Chapter, Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> And Radhakrishnan says, "It is not to the person Kṛṣṇa." Why? Kṛṣṇa says, "Just think-of Me, <span class="Italic">man-manāḥ,</span> just become My devotee, and just offer Me obeisances, worship Me." It is plain language. And if some rascal says, "No no, it is not to Kṛṣṇa," why shall I accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> It is not the personified Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you see. I shall immediately detect that here is a rascal. Because Kṛṣṇa says personally, and he says it is not to the person. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> But Kṛṣṇa had been on this earth in flesh and bones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is history, <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they have accepted, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka. <span class="Italic">Svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me.</span> Arjuna accepts Him, Paraṁbrahman. You are Paraṁbrahman. Not that "Because I am your friend and I am accepting You as Paraṁbrahman, but all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> they have accepted." [break] <span class="Italic">...mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam.</span> Because I am talking with you as a human being, only rascals, they think I am human being." If you think Kṛṣṇa as having flesh and bone, then you become a rascal, immediately. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam, paraṁ bhāvam ajānantaḥ [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I am not made of this bone and flesh. I am <span class="Italic">cinmaya,</span> I am fully spirit soul." So one who does not know it, he is a rascal. So as soon as you will say that He is made of bone and flesh, that means you are rascal. (laughter) Why shall I hear you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> When Lord Kṛṣṇa came into being, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That does not mean that... Suppose I am here. I am driving with you. But there is difference between you and me. So Kṛṣṇa comes as human being, that does not mean He is human being. Why don't you understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> That is okay. But from the normal, you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your study. That is foolish study. Therefore He says <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> The rascals think that I am one of the human beings. If he is one of the human beings, how he can say <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the human society, there are big men, you are big man, I am small man, he is still more, he is still more, he is still bigger. There are so many varieties. But He says "No more superior than Me." That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No one is supreme than Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> That He says, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says everything but because we are foolish we do not hear Him. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> We don't understand Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we understand. But we do not accept it. What is the difficulty to understand? God is superior. Everyone knows it. But I will not accept, he will not accept. Unless one is superior, how He can be God? [break] <span class="Italic">...sevayā.</span> Therefore you have to find out somebody who knows Him.

I said "No, I don't take it." "And you could sleep?" I said, "Yes." Then he said, "Can I have these?" "Yes yes, you can have by all means." (laughter) So he took away all the pills for his own use.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> I was rather very much surprised when I first met, Prabhupāda, about four or five devotees on the streets of this Honolulu. Because I went from this side, Japan, Hong Kong, Thailand, and then entered in America through Honolulu, Hawaii. So when I went I was just in the morning, I was trying to get the tourist bus moving in the whole city to see. And then on the main road, you know that main road, have you been to Honolulu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He has gone.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> Five devotees were having drums, this <span class="Italic">khola,</span> they were dancing like, I mean, in their own mood, you know. So then I had a curiosity. I just stopped one of them and I said, "Well, Mr. I would like to know about all this." He said, "Yes, you come to our temple in the morning and we'll tell you all about it." But I said that "What you are doing?" "We are playing <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span>" I said "Well, why you are out on the streets." "Because these all demons. These are all demons you know. So those who do not have any spiritual knowledge, so we want to penetrate in their ears, and through their ears in their hearts, the name of Kṛṣṇa. So that even if they don't like it, well, the Kṛṣṇa name should enter in their hearts."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... This <span class="Italic">mantra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> "So that is what we are doing. So even if they don't like it we are doing. So whosoever is passing by he will have at least his ears will be accustomed to hear the name of Lord Kṛṣṇa." I said, "But in <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> it is said that those who do not wish to know the true knowledge, well, it is forbidden for the devotees or for the followers to tell them anything about spiritual knowledge." "So that, sir, we are not imparting knowledge to each individual by catching them. We are just playing ourselves. So whosoever likes it, he can stand by us. Otherwise we are not..." So they replied also correctly to this also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and Kṛṣṇa says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā,</span> then I said "What is this?" "This is <span class="Italic">śikhā."</span> I said, "Well what it is meant for?" So he said "Well, this is the..." What he told me was this exactly, that the aerial of knowledge. He said that this is the aerial of knowledge. I said is it your own interpretation. No, but I think that I feel that way. This is the aerial of knowledge.

[break] ...I mean is it regular new films are being made or only one or two films have been made so far?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We make more films.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's another one just coming up now which explains the philosophy in more detail. The films were to show general activities, that was <span class="Italic">The Hare Kṛṣṇa People.</span> The new film was to show the farming scheme that Prabhupāda set up in New Vrindaban, and many other farms we have now. And there was one other film to show how the books are produced and then delivered to the public. So gradually more and more are coming out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> You know one thing I have found that there is spotless cleanliness in the centers. Whereas in our temples here in India, even when we go to Hardwar and Hrishikesh and all these, the temples, the outer cleanliness, not proper emphasis is given by the management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I stress on this cleanliness very much. If they keep unclean, I chastise them like anything. (laughing) They have learned this art. I always say, "Cleanliness is next to godliness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> About two years back, two, three of your devotees came to our house here. Naturally we offered them, "Would you like to have coffee, tea?" They said, "No." Then we said, "Would you like to have Coca-cola." They said, "No." Then I said, "What would you like to have, milk?" "Yes." <span class="Italic">Lassi, chach?(?)</span> Yes. Fruit. Yes. It happened so that Girirāja came to us twice, and twice it was this <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span> Now <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> day they are not supposed to eat this wheat or flour or anything. So when last we came to Bangleswara (?), so we brought some <span class="Italic">paraṭās</span> with this <span class="Italic">gobi(?)</span> in it.</div>

They said "No, we can't eat because it is <span class="Italic">ekādaśī."</span> So we said that "No you won't eat, so it looks odd that we should eat." But we were very hungry, you know. In the morning we didn't take anything. We said "All right, we eat, now we will go to the bazaar and see if we could get something." Then we went to Mahabaleswar, it was all closed, because it was raining season. And then there was one shop which had bananas, good amount of bananas. So we took one dozen or two dozen bananas, and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Banana is very good. You can make banana and potato. Potato boil and mixed with banana, and make nice <span class="Italic">puri</span>. And then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> How Girirāja, I just ask you, how you took to all these good things of life? I mean in natural form or with some self-discipline or with some coercion or with some what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It was Prabhupāda's mercy. I was looking for a guru. Actually whenever I heard there was a swami or a yogi, I would always go, even hundreds of miles. But I was never satisfied. But Śrīla Prabhupāda perfectly satisfied all of my questions. And I liked the process, chanting, dancing, taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> offering <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> and I liked the devotees. It was very pleasing. So I immediately decided this is my real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Malhotra:</span> No, but not taking any wheat, like on <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> day, all such things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's training. Once we surrender to the spiritual master, then he trains us in the process of spiritual life.</div>
