<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...many buildings like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...there is one word, <span class="Italic">sva-langulena atithi tīrtvā sindhum.</span> We see sometimes the dogs are swimming. (greets someone:) Good morning. If somebody thinks, "Oh, the dog is swimming, so let me capture the tail, and I shall swim. I shall cross." So similarly, those who are thinking, the so-called scientists, philosopher, will solve the problems, it is exactly like to cross over the Pacific Ocean by capturing the tail of a dog. (laughter) If one thinks that "Dog is sufficiently strong to carry me. So he is swimming, so I shall swim also," so following the dogs, capturing their tail, if one thinks that he will cross over the Pacific Ocean... Similarly, these so-called scientists, philosophers, are like dogs, and if anyone thinks that he will cross by capturing his tail, he will be baffled. [break] ...bomb scientist still living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes, he's still living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what he is doing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Now he is retired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. No more swimming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No more swimming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> He's taking money from the government for his work so that he can live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, money is everyone is getting. The dog is also getting. Sometimes dog is inheriting the property of his master. But that does not mean he is not a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> About one month ago there was a very big story in the newspapers about how this student who went to all the archives in the Washington D.C. library, and from known records he compiled enough information to construct an atom bomb. Did you hear about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He became world famous. So they concluded that anyone who wanted to could get normal information from normal sources and theoretically construct an atom bomb. But they don't have the equipment, but they have the knowledge now. So they're proposing in that sense that any terrorist organization within the next five years will be able to invent their own atom bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He was bribing one city in Florida that "You pay me so much money or else I'm going to blow up your city." And he sent them the plans, "Here is the bomb." So they became very frightened. And when they traced the letter, they found that it was only a sixteen year old boy who had done this. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the sound of the church bell very much. It is very attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You want one like that for Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They have an organ here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you play the organ and the bells chime out a melody from that tower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which tower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> That big tower here. They have bells up on top, and they can play different melodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> As they fall off. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> ...problem of suicide here, but in all schools all over the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are publicly suiciding, and others are silently suiciding. The suiciding policy is going on. Somebody manifests; somebody does not manifest. That's all. If the human life is wasted for sense gratification, that is suicidal. Because you got the opportunity of enlightenment and you live like dogs and cats, this is suicide. [break] This, what is called, hydrogen bomb manufacturer, he is thinking that he is successful in his life by discovering this hydrogen bomb. but he does not know how to save him from death. So it is suicidal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are simply expert at accelerating death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever he has done, so he could not save him. He cannot save him from death. So what is the use of this scientific knowledge? If the dog is also going to die and he is also going to die, so where is the difference of his scientific knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Coincidentally, the original purpose of the hydrogen bomb was to prevent death, to end the Second World War as soon as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can prevent? That he does not know, how to prevent. He can accelerate. That's all. [break] ...puts before us, "Here is your problem, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span> Solve it." Where is that scientist? They avoid the real problem and take some childish problem. [break] ...not any hidden problem. It is the open problem. Kṛṣṇa puts it: <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam,</span> The real seer will see to these problems. There is no answer or solution of these problems. Where is the solution of these problems? Where is the biochemist or the psychologist or the atom bombist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The theory nowadays is that by the proliferation of atomic weapons, that Russia has so many weapons, China has so many weapons, the United States has so much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone now. India has also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They're all afraid of using them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must use it. That is nature's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, right. History.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is nature's arrangement (chuckles) that you all die. That is nature's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When someone gets some power he wants to try it out. Just like there was that demon. Lord Śiva gave him power: whoever head he touched, the head would fall off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in your country there are so many cars so that a poor man like me has car always, not an inch move on leg. So because there is so many. There are so many cars. So there are so many weapons now. That must be used. That is a natural sequence. They must use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That is why they have wars, just so they can use up the weapons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The only difficulty is that if one person uses the atomic weapon, that means entire, it would be entire waste of mankind. So everyone's afraid of using the ultimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, anyway, they must be used. There is no doubt about it. Therefore we can say there will be war. It is no astrology. It is natural conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That'd mean total destruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, total or partial, that we shall see. But they must be used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Now they like to blow them up in the ground. The scientists like to play by blowing them up in the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or in the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They create big disturbances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...can be solved by understanding these three items: God is the proprietor; He is the enjoyer; He is friend of everyone. They are acting just the opposite way: "I am the proprietor; I am the enjoyer; I am the friend. Because I am God." This is their... Everyone is becoming friend-ultimately proves to be enemy of the country because he is not friend. President Nixon took votes by pretending friendship, and later on, he proved enemy. This is going on. Everyone knows. Gandhi pretended to become friend, but he proved to become an enemy. Otherwise why he was shot down? Unless one thought him as enemy, why he was shot down? This is going on. Nobody can become friend except Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But a pure devotee is a friend to all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he carries the message of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is friend, and he is carrying the friendly message. Therefore he is friend. If there is a nice friend and if somebody gives information of that nice friend, he is also friend. Therefore nobody can become friend except Kṛṣṇa's representative. The material world is: "I am your enemy, and you are my enemy." This is the whole construction of the material world. So how the enemy can become friend? It is pretension, cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When we go out to distribute books, we try and show the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> that the devotee is actually their friend also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, certainly. That is the real friendship work. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says,</div>
<div class="Verse">kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśācīra kole,</div>
<div class="Verse">enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi'<br class="calibre2"/>hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi'</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is friendship. "You are sleeping under the spell of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and how long you will sleep and suffer in this material world? So I have brought this medicine. You take it and you will no more sleep."</div>
<div class="Verse">enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi'<br class="calibre2"/>hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao...</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Now take Hare Kṛṣṇa mantra, this medicine."</div>
<div class="Verse">hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi'</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So all relationships in this material world are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inimical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Based on this enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Even the so-called love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is lust. That is not love. And as soon as my lusty desire is not fulfilled, then you are my enemy. [break] If we take shelter of any materialistic person, that is like to take the..., capture the tail of a dog and try to swim over the Pacific Ocean. It is like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> ...ing that we should not give people anything other than Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what you have to give? First of all you consider what you have to give. What you have got to give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> I was thinking that sometimes the devotees engage in business, selling so many things to help the temples, and you were saying that we should not do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are business-minded, you can do that. Do business and give the result to Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...planting a tree. And here are the animals. The tiger and the lizard, fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is zoology. They study all the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Well, they think they get an idea of man by studying the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Catching the tail of the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Of the crab. Then they come to conclude that since all the animals do is eat, sleep, mate and defend, man should also just do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why he has become man? Why not animal? Therefore the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "One who is engaged in these animal activities, he is animal. He is not man." <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma idya-dhīḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Actually, man is doing like that. In the jungle the similar animals, they flock together. This nationalism is like that. It is nothing better than that. So our defending, that "We are Americans," "We are Indians," "We are Germans"-the same thing. Because they are animals, they have this United Nations. The animals will fight, so they are trying to compromise, "Let us live peacefully." That is not possible because they are animals, all failure. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Under the threat of nuclear warfare wouldn't Kṛṣṇa consciousness be more easy to spread?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, threat is already there. But they are so fool that they are not afraid of the threat. Threat is already there. Everyone will die. That is the problem. So who is caring for this? They are avoiding this. They cannot take any anti measures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So it will take a war to bring them to their senses a bit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, war is going on. But they are so senseless that they will not come to this, so rascal. Therefore they are described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very hard to preach to these fools, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These people are so stupid, it is very difficult to preach to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) No, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we are hearing from you and your books that we will die, and we must learn to face these problems as you mentioned, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9],</span> but still, even as your disciples, we are not so convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because we've been brought up in a culture where we've been taught that we will never die. Particularly in America we never even see death here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You think you will not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know I will, but how can we realize that, come to the platform of realizing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is dying, your father is dying, your mother is dying, your friend is dying, and still if you cannot understand, then how it will be possible to make you understand? Every day you see so many people are dying. <span class="Italic">Ahāny ahāni lokāni gacchanti yamālayam iha.</span> Every moment, every day, we see so many animals or men are dying. <span class="Italic">Śeṣaḥ sthitam icchanti kim āścaryam...</span> But those who are living he is thinking, "I will not die." Death is inevitable but still, he is thinking, "I will not die." Therefore that is the problem. Everyone is dying, and everyone is trying not to die. This is the problem. Nobody wants to die, but everyone is dying. That problem this rascal scientist cannot solve. Therefore they are like dogs, and to catch their tail is like that. Yes. And that is the real problem. Everyone is dying, and everyone is trying not to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The Śaivites go down to the burning ghāṭas. The Śaivites, they go down to the place where the bodies are being burned in order to meditate on the fact that everyone is going to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is meditation? Without meditation even, one can understand, if he is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. So much trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So one must become convinced philosophically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why philosophically? Philosophy means, at the present moment, mental concoction. We don't say that. Philosophy means to find out the reality. That is philosophy, not that "I think like this. He thinks like this. He thinks like this." That is not philosophy; that is mental concoction, hovering over the mental plane. Philosophy is here. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam: [Bg. 13.9]</span> "Keep always in your front that there is death, there is birth, and try to save yourself from this." This is philosophy. What is this hot air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> It is coming from the heating system of the university. They have a nuclear heating system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is that nuclear waste?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes. They have a reactor on the campus. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they require so many scientist to get heat from the nuclear system, then who has created the sun to diffuse so much heat? How great scientist He is. They have no sense that who has created the sun's nuclear system, that heating the whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They can't even measure how much heat is coming from the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They say that the sun is inefficient because in some places it's too hot and in some places it's too cold, so therefore they have to make the adjustment by making the air conditioners and the heaters in order to make up for the sun's inefficiency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who is getting this advantage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Big businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Actually, the fact is that now the scientists are spending so much money on this research, but the research is only being used in their personal homes. The common people have never seen any of these great devices. This one devotee, Jayarama, his uncle is a big scientist. He has created this radio telescope. So I saw pictures of his personal home, and it must cost about $300,000. All these scientific devices he has. But the people never see those things. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...and for all the success of scientific advancement, they have not created any love for God or their fellow man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the defect. They should scientifically explain what is Kṛṣṇa. Then their science is perfect. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">,</span> education, <span class="Italic">tapasya, sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddha-dattayoḥ,</span> charity and gentleness, all good qualities. So <span class="Italic">kavibhiḥ nirūpito. Kavibhiḥ,</span> big personalities they have decided, <span class="Italic">yad-uttamaśloka-guṇanuvarṇanam.</span> If, by their knowledge they can establish <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam...,</span> Kṛṣṇa is the origin, then their scientific knowledge is perfect. <span class="Italic">Avicyutaḥ arthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito. Kavibhiḥ</span> means great learned scholars. They have decided like this, <span class="Italic">yad-uttamaśloka-guṇanuvarṇanam,</span> instead of talking all nonsense, "This is this. This is this," if they can scientifically explain that "Kṛṣṇa is the original scientist, and His brain has done this like this, like this..." That is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> who is the original scientist, who is original philosopher, original-everything original. <span class="Italic">Anādir ādir govindaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Govinda is the origin of everything. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Vāsudeva is the original founder. That is a fact. The origin is Kṛṣṇa, but they do not find it. Now, this sprinkling is being done, water and air. Now, who is the origin of air and water? You have combined together, utilizing as a spray, but who is the origin of air and water? You cannot manufacture air or water. You are taking advantage of it by mixing together, sprinkling, but where is the origin of water and air?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The scientists now, they have been studying the different atoms. They say that the origin is what they call pure energy. And they describe that as a disembodied electrical charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jugglery of words, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Their idea is very close to the Brahman conception, though. They think that one pure energy is pervading the whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> And it has no material properties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you accept energy, then you must enquire what is the source of the energy? Energy is produced. Just like here is energy, but it is produced under certain arrangement. Where the energy is being produced? If you accept energy, that is knowledge. Now, just like electrical energy is, what is called, generated in the powerhouse. You cannot say the electrical energy has jump over. It is being generated. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then wherefrom this electric energy is coming? Where is the generating house? You cannot say that electric ener..., so many electrical light, they have come all of a sudden, no. There is a regular generating house. So where is that generating house? What is their reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> You may get some of them to admit that they don't know, but then they'll think, "No one knows." They will say, "Well, no one knows that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because you are rascal, therefore you cannot say that everyone is rascal. You rascal, you do not know. But we know because we are not rascals. We know. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we know. You do not know, you rascal. But we know. Then what is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I said that once to a professor, and I was dressed in plain clothes, and then he became very upset, and he said, "I thought I was talking to a book salesman, and now I find out that you're a preacher."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) He is gentleman. He has admitted. A gentleman, if he commits some mistake, he admits, "Yes." He is gentleman. And if he persists on his mistake, he is rascal. He is a rascal. So he is a gentleman. (end)</div>
