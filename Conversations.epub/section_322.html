<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So at some stage during the lifetime, especially in the human form of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...one should come to the senses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...that they are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not to speak like mad man. That you are scientists, you are, "We shall solve all the questions." This nonsense thing should stop. They should come to God and understand what God says. Then their life is successful. God Himself is speaking in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just try to understand. This is not meant for the dogs and cats; this is meant for persons like Arjuna. Because <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was taught to Arjuna-for enlightened, ah, topmost class of men. They'll understand. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ. Evaṁ paramparā prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So be yourself amongst the topmost intelligent class of men and try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda, we should go this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But if you want to remain unhappy by your whims, then what... God cannot help you. But you have got the intelli..., independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So Prabhupāda, if some people say, "Well, I have no free will," that means that they are actually lazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have got free will, but must utilize it properly. That is free will. Free will means to utilize it properly. That is free will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So people... Sometimes Kṛṣṇa interferes in the free will?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Our free will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> God interferes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Because by your free will you are going to hell. If Kṛṣṇa interferes, that is Kṛṣṇa's special favor. Just like a child is going to touch fire by free will, and father, "Eh, don't do it." That is his special favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But it's called causeless mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Causeless mercy. His mercy is already there, but we are denying the mercy. That is the defect of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Spiritual master is the mercy of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is distributing His mercy from within and from without. Without mercy is the spiritual master. Without means externally, just in front of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahhh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...<span class="Italic">bhakta-gaṇe.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Impersonalist boys... [break] ...who are... [break] Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What is life cannot be proved by experiments. So it is not necessary to talk about life now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Grapes are sour. (devotees laugh) The jackal's philosophy. The jackal came in the orchard of grapes and tried to take some grapes. He jumped many times, and when he failed, "Oh, there is no necessity, it is sour." It is jackal's philosophy. Sly fox.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say that ultimately there may be no difference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Māyāvāda, Māyāvāda. Māyāvāda says <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> This world is false. [break] ...so what... [break] ...prepared it, so he is the cause of this construction of the bench. How can you say there is no cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Then they would say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They would say, "If everything has a cause..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "...then God also must have a cause."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is God, which has no cause. That is our definition. Everything has cause, but when it comes to a point where there is no more cause, He is cause and effect Himself, then that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So then sometimes they say, "Well, what's to say there will ever be original cause?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? [break] ...that is original cause. We... [break] <span class="Italic">...anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ. Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">].</span> That is actual element, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">That is... [break] The actual element is so complete that you take the complete from the complete, still it is complete. [break] ...but complete element means you go on taking hundred dollars every moment, still hundred dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They would say that's impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their ignorance. There is such a thing. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇasya pūrṇam</span>. That is Vedic information. Therefore <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] Why not? Just like we can see materially that sunshine, for millions and millions of years it is shiny, still it is the same temperature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But it's diminishing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The volume of the sun is diminishing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because it is material. But we can understand that there... Of course, that is no... That touchstone. The touchstone can create gold. So unlimitedly it can create gold. Touchstone. So, even in material experience we'll find there is certain things which creates unlimitedly, still it remains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's a starfish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There is a fish called the starfish. It has five arms, and if it loses one arm it will grow that arm back, or that arm will grow back four other arms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That's just material generation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I have already said there is an idea that even in the insignificant material element we find this, that one is lost, another's grown. [break] So when the Supreme Absolute Truth is there, how much potency? That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> <span class="Italic">Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the idea of the Absolute. You take the complete from the complete, still it is complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They are so foolish that they have accepted an entity called infinity for the material purposes, from mathematics and everything, and they know that they are limited, but they will not accept that that can be a living entity which is infinite. They can accept that there's a new number called infinity, but they can't understand that there can be a living entity which is infinite too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That number is matter. Living entity is always superior. So if in the inferior quality, matter, it is possible, how much it is possible in the superior quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And they also admit that they're limited, they also admit that they are fallible, so they also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is matter, it is limited, always limited. Although it appears unlimited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say they're limited but their process is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say their process, the scientific process, is not limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another nonsense. If you are limited, how you can manufacture process... [break] ... is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They don't say... They say they haven't manufactured it. They've just discovered it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you are limited, how can you discover the unlimited? Then what is the meaning of limited? You cannot discover...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But if I am limited <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> I can discover Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? No, you do not discover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It's there in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you know from higher authority. You cannot discover it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's right. [break] Also... [break] ...does it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is conservation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually the material world is never annihilated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam evāvaśiṣyate [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Doesn't it rest in Viṣṇu's body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When the material world is annihilated, it still is there, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the five elements are all eternal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I understand that the process is eternal, Prabhupāda said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, no, no, the five elements are eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...each universe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The five elements are eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternal, but it is manifested and not manifested. Just like conservation of energy. That is the... Energy is manifested, sometimes not manifested. [break] But nonmanifested does not mean that... [break] ...energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the definition of the Absolute Truth is inconceivable, so it must violate the logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Their logic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it's inconceivable by them, not by us. Therefore we call them fools. It is not inconceivable by us. But so you know the Truth from the Truth, Absolute Truth. A layman or a foolish boy does not know where..., which side the sun will rise. His father can say, "This side it will rise." That is the difference. Because he knows how to suggest which side, because there is reddish, how do you say? Illumination. He knows that "This side it will rise," by the symptom. Both of them, the foolish man and the intelligent man, just at present do not see that where is the sun. But the intelligent man knows "Here is the sun," although the sun is not visible both to the intelligent and foolish man. That intelligence means he knows how to find out where is sun. That is intelligence. And this is not discovery. I am intelligent speaking "This side is sun." It is not my discovery. I have heard from authority that from the eastern direction the sun rises, so I know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They're so stupid they name it Absolute Truth, but still they try to make their own theories about the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In the Vedic literatures it is stated <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> They can't even understand a simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means the codes, the laws of God. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that "You give up your nonsense manufactured religion. Here is religion. Surrender unto Me." Who will deny? Any religious person will accept it. Who will deny it? This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So who will deny? Who is that man who will deny this statement, that one has to surrender to the Supreme? Who will deny it? Therefore it is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> You have to submit, just like the government. The government is the supreme, who will deny? Who will deny?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Only the criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only the criminal. And he'll be punished, that's all. The result, he'll be punished. Beaten with the shoes of policeman, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Some people get away with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For some time he'll get away. You can get away from the police custody, but you cannot get away from <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> custody. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But because in all material examples there are exceptions, they say. In all material examples there are exceptions, so they try to find that exception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many exceptions are there, <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante.</span> Those who are devotee, they are not under <span class="Italic">māyā. Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> If you do not violate the laws of God... [break] ...there is no question of being... [break]...by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> If you surrender... [break] ...<span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...if the government protects everyone who is surrendered to the laws of the God, government. The government will give all protection. If he is a law-abiding citizen, he must be given protection, all protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You're too intelligent for the atheists, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You're too intelligent for the atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Atheist means criminal, they're punishable, that's all. And the more people becoming godless, they're being punished by nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually by the law of conservation of energy reincarnation can be explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> By their own law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Why shouldn't consciousness also be conserved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Consciousness is also energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Energy of the soul. As soon as the soul is passed from the body, there is no more consciousness. It is very easy to understand. They cannot explain why the consciousness stops. They cannot explain. But that is the symptom. <span class="Italic">Yena sarvam idam, avināśi tu tad viddhi..., yena sarvam idam,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That thing which is spreading the energy all over the body, that is eternal. Now, what is that thing which is spreading the consciousness? It is the soul. So long the soul is there, you have got consciousness, otherwise there is no consciousness. Very plain word. <span class="Italic">Avināśi tu tad viddhi.</span> Just try to understand that thing which is spreading consciousness all over the body. Just like a small grain of poison. As soon as you take it, immediately it will spread all over the blood. Even a small grain. And then how much powerful is that spiritual spark?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So the grain is carried by the blood. What is the spiritual spark carried by?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual spark is not carried by, but he resides within the body. He is carried by his own <span class="Italic">karma,</span> subtle, subtle desire is carried. Everyone is carried by his desire. Why did I come here, in America? I have got a desire to preach; therefore I've come. Otherwise I had no business to come here. So desire. So desire carries you. That is, the rascals, they do not know. Desire is there, they cannot see, but desire is there. Mind is there, intelligence is there; they cannot see. That is carried. The example is given, just like the aroma of a flower is being carried by the air. And nobody can see, but one can feel, "Oh, it is very good, nice aroma. Wherefrom it is coming?" But he has no eyes to see either the aroma or the air. Similarly, the soul after destruction of this body is being carried by the desire, but they have no eyes to see what is that desire, what is that soul, what is that intelligence. They are saying, "There is no soul." This is mostly stupidity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply stupids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So if someone is Kṛṣṇa conscious, then nothing can be hidden from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If someone is Kṛṣṇa conscious, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because he learned from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam, na jāyate na mriyate vā..., na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are... Kṛṣṇa consciousness means you are taking what Kṛṣṇa says. Therefore... [break] And then you judge in your own way, you'll find, "Yes, it's all right." <span class="Italic">Avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam.</span> At the present moment, because your, these blunt eyes cannot see the soul, you have to learn it by appreciation. <span class="Italic">Avagama. I</span>t is called <span class="Italic">avagama.(?)</span> Appreciation. Just like Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">tad viddhi,</span> that, that thing which is spreading consciousness, that is soul. Now you can perceive there must be something which is now absent, otherwise why there is no consciousness? Where is the difficulty? If you do not see, you can't understand it. Just like the same example, when good aroma is carried. So somebody says, "This good aroma is coming because the air passing through a flower garden, therefore this aroma." Now this is a fact, but you cannot see the aroma or the air. But you hear from an experienced man. That is the way of understanding which is beyond your sense perception. But these rascals, simply they are depending on their blunt senses, these stupids, so-called scientists. Therefore they're stupids. They simply believe on their eyes. They do not know how much defective these eyes and senses are, incomplete. That they do not know. They believe on their defective senses. <span class="Italic">Akṣaja. Akṣaja, akṣ...</span> Experiment. Everything experimented. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says don't try to explain which is beyond your sense. How you will explain? It is not possible. <span class="Italic">Acintyāḥ khalu ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet</span>. It is <span class="Italic">acintya,</span> it is beyond your conception. Why you are wasting your time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But a scientist will say that "I can show you what the aroma looks like."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot show you, that is another stupidity. (indistinct) anything. Who can deny that Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sar...,</span> there is a thing within the body which is eternal? And what is that thing which is spreading consciousness? And you show what is that thing which is spreading consciousness. Then I shall accept you as scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They would say, "How can we believe Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you don't believe, that here is a fact! That there is something within the body which is spreading consciousness. That is eternal. There's no question of believing. It is a fact. Now you show, what is that fact? Where is that fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll say it's just biochemical reactions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Biochemical... You simply do it, rascal. You cannot do it. (Hṛdayānanda laughs) You rascal, simply speak, but you cannot do it. That is our contention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are rascal. You speak something which is beyond your power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda solves...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore it is simply cheating people. And we, Kṛṣṇa conscious men, we want to stop these cheating, any way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They'd say we also cannot prove the soul is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is proof. There is something. We accept it, but you don't accept it. There are so many things, there are so many things. You do not see, but still you accept it. Just like without father there cannot be son. Now you have not seen your father, but mother says, "Here is your father." You have to believe it. It is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they can experience being a father themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They can experience that, 'cause they can be a father themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can be father themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Without son how one becomes father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, but they... That example falls within the range of their experience, because they can also be a father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not to your experience. But a superior experience, say mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not your experience. You cannot say by experience who is your father. Your mother can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, but the example that I have a father can be appreciated because I can also be a father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But therefore if that appreciation is there, that <span class="Italic">avināśi tu tad viddhi yena...,</span> the consciousness is spreading from the soul, so you have to appreciate there must be something from which consciousness comes. That you cannot deny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say it is biochemical development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but then you replace consciousness by a biochemical combination. That you cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When the baby is born dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But just because they say, "Because we can't do it yet..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. You cannot do, therefore you are rascal. You're talking all nonsense. You cannot do it, how you speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Up till two hundred years ago they weren't able to fly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Want two hundred..., no, we want immediately, we don't want blank check. (devotees laugh) Rascal blank check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, we can go this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Postdated blank check. (devotees laugh) We don't believe. We must have real cash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And then they will admit actually that their senses are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, then they'll want to see the soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...are limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...they want to see a soul as eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Go to one life to another life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Where is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, actually this knowledge is so absolute, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">pratyakṣāvagamaṁ dharmyam.</span> You can actually experience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...just by taking <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> you can see that your purification comes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...and actually intelligence comes from Kṛṣṇa. So if actually one is sincere, then Kṛṣṇa will give him intelligence that "Yes, actually there is a soul, and actually I'm the Supersoul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That intelligence is defective</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, my senses are defective. But the source from which I know, that is not defective. I cannot experimentally know who is my father. But the source from whom I understand, that is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In other words they'll get confirmation within their heart. They'll be satisfied, that "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is God," if they are sincere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah. If they are sincere. That is the <span class="Italic">budha. Budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Others, rascals cannot (indistinct). <span class="Italic">Mūḍha narādhama.</span> They cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They'll say you're sincerely brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They'll say you're sincerely brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brainwashed? Why? These are facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But we still have some basis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you cannot reply, you're simply misrepresenting scientists. We say there must be something which is spreading consciousness. Now how can you deny it? It is not brainwash. There must be something. Now if you are scientist, you find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That which is spreading consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is that thing which is spreading consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So if they say it is the chemical, but they can't do that, they can't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you put the chemicals. Just like I have sent my car, it is not running, so they know how it will run. They know. Therefore I say, "But if you do not know, you're speaking nonsense. You do not know anything." And as soon as you are captured, you say "Yes, in future I shall know." What is this? The same, postdated blank check, which has no value. Will the postdated check, will it be accepted by anyone? Suppose you give me a postdated check. If I'm paying, what is this nonsense? This is all nonsense. "Future." (devotees laugh) No future, sir. Immediately. Cash payment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So that's cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they'll say, "But you also cannot show us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I can show you. I say, there must be something. There must be something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We say it's a spirit; they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be there, I say "something." You find out that something. I say something. I don't say spirit, matter or anything. Something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes, they say that they look...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that is their cheating. Find out now, and I accept that they're scientists. Yes. Cash money, sir. Then I shall know that you are rich man. You want to cheat me with the paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's why they'll say that "We are doing research."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means that... Then don't talk that you are scientists. You are student. You are trying to learn. You're student. You cannot say that you are scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So regardless of our position, they are not qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their system is to remain a student and pose as teacher, their system. They're trying to learn it, and still they're posing as teacher. Teacher means one who knows. He does not know; still he poses in the post of a teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So the system cannot be good because it does not purify their character. They still cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they're cheating simply. Little knowledge, cheating. Little knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They're simply like <span class="Italic">neti neti.</span> "Not this, not this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Not this." Yes. By negation. Definition by negation. Not positive definition. They say "it is not this." But what it is they cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It is not God but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Either they accept our evidence or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore they are fools. That is a fact. Any child can understand that... And even they're less than a child. If I say there is something, therefore there is consciousness, any boy can understand. But they cannot understand. Less than a boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say there's no proof that that something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proof. That is the proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, their own law of conservation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, I'm talking about the individuality...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Individuality... There are so many proofs, there are so many proofs, how you can say it is not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> By their own laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not that. It is different subject. That something is missing within the body, therefore it is dead. So what is your answer? We say something is missing. We shall decide what is that something later on. That something is missing. If you suggest that something is chemical combination, then you do it. Therefore do not know. I say something is missing. If you know, then you replace that something, then you'll know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> What do we say that something is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... That everyone, any layman can understand, that this dead body is unconscious because something is missing. Any layman can understand. If you know that, then you replace it. I don't say I know, but I say something is missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to accept also that. But if you know that something, then you replace it. Otherwise you also do not know. Then why you are talking of big, big word? You do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But something is missing. That is accepted by everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Dāsa:</span> (laughs) So we both don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? No, I know better than you. Because you are a fool, I'm a fool, but you are a fool and still you are posing you know. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They may say, "We don't know, but we're trying to find out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That also... Then why I shall give you better position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We are also trying to find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why should I give you better position? You're on the same level with me. Why you are posing as "I am scientist"? You are a fool, you admit I am fool, you admit you are a fool. But why you are posing as scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because they will say that they have a..., they are trying to find out experimental things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have not found out, that's a fact. As I have not found, therefore you are equally fool like me. Don't pose yourself better than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> If we're both fools...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But at least we are accepting some authority which is supposedly very authorized by great saints, sages...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They have also great authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all the authorities... No, therefore these persons who do not accept authority, they're rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They are accepting authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're accepting authority who is not authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They're fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Darwin, they're accepting Darwin as authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say, "But why should we accept any one of your authorities?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then you come to argument, reason, then whether Darwin is authority or Kṛṣṇa is authority, we have to decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They accept like, "I have not seen President Nixon, but I accept because I read in the newspaper." So somebody says that, well, by following this <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> you can see Kṛṣṇa, but they will not accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Why should they accept Kṛṣṇa as authority over Darwin authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Because He's accepted by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Great sages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...great sages, saintly persons, scholars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> By many scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then fool's paradise it is called... It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. That is the only conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That's what they say about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because this world is all full of fools, so it is very difficult to push on. That we know. Therefore we should not go to the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Birds of a feather flock together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So they can go to Darwin's planet, we'll go to Kṛṣṇa's planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But how will we defeat them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yānti bhūtejyā bhūtāni.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> By giving them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> We'll defeat them by giving them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> right, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To cure their disease, you have to give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> and give them chance to hear Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is valuable. Just like a man suffering from jaundice, he sees everything yellow, and if you say, "No, it is not yellow. White" "No, I see yellow." What can be done, then the medicine has to be given. He'll never say it is white. He'll say it is yellow, because he is suffering. You have to cure. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness method is curing the disease of jaundice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In other words, Prabhupāda, unless there are enough gentlemen to accept saintly persons, we cannot talk to them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2): :</span>...we have to defeat them by<span class="Bold"> </span>prasādam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, we have to show them mercy. It is not a question of defeat. Just like a diseased person is talking nonsense, so doctors takes care, "All right, go on talking nonsense. Take this medicine." (devotees laugh) That is hospitalization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They're already defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, already defeated by nature. <span class="Italic">Māyayāpahṛta-jñāna</span>. That is stated, <span class="Italic">apahṛta-jñāna. Māyā</span> is taking their all knowledge, and because <span class="Italic">māyā </span>is taking their all knowledge, the preaching is required. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So why wouldn't, why couldn't they accept that such simple thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're not wise. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Na māṁ prapadyante mūḍhāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.15]. Because they always engage in sinful activities. These are the sym..., cause of their disease. They're sinful, they're rascal, lowest of the mankind, and whatever knowledge they are proud of, that is <span class="Italic">māyā</span>, and the basic principle is they're <span class="Italic">asuras</span>, atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Just like a prisoner trying to demand explanation from the King...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us go (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Prabhupāda, we should go straight back; it's getting late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? No, no. What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara: :</span>Quarter to seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Quarter to seven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when someone is sick, he willingly goes to the doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the injunction of the Vedas. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva</span>...<span class="Italic"> </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]. Therefore these rascals should go to a bona fide guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So how we can get them to willingly come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...to the guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if you are diseased, you are suffering the pains, so naturally you shall be inclined how to reduce the pain, how to get out of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But the scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these rascals, even though are suffering three kinds of pains, <span class="Italic">tri-tāpa-yatna.</span> Just like why you are covered? Because there is pain. Severe cold, similarly severe heat. So we are suffering, either summer season or winter season. We are suffering, <span class="Italic">tri-tāpa-yatna</span>. There is suffering from our mind, from our body-this is natural suffering. There is bodily suffering, mental suffering, then suffering caused by other living entities. So we are always suffering. But still they're thinking that "We are happy." The disease is already there. Ah? Just like the Arabian do not want to give you petrol. That means there's suffering caused by other nations. So this is going on. They're simply trying to settle up. But the suffering is there. But they're not in their knowledge, that in spite of all their endeavors, the sufferings are there. What is the cause? Then whom shall I go to ask why the suffering is there? <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]. Therefore you must approach a person who knows how the suffering should be mitigated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But there's so many so-called gurus, Prabhupāda, how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you cannot go to the so-called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> How can you convince that we are the real genuine people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you will have to learn, just like you have to go to school, there is injunction. But if you do not know what is school, go to a cow farmer(?), then that is your fault. If I say, "You go and purchase this from the market," suppose you have to purchase gold, but you go to a storefront, milk seller, how you will get the gold? That intelligence you must have, that where gold can be had. You must go to the person who is dealing really with gold. But if you do not know, then you will be cheated. That much knowledge you must have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That is book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Just like there are some good schools and some bad schools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because now they're so fallen, they do not go, neither they know; therefore we are canvassing, "Here is a school."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our business. "Here is knowledge, come on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Still they won't go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> This is the only knowledge. Everybody else is distributing ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Sometimes questions are raised saying that how do we know that a bird is more intelligent than a human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes, bird is more intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But we are posing that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like, just like, here is a bird, as soon as he see so many men are coming, he'll jump over you. You are not intelligent to jump over. Suppose someone is coming to stab you; you cannot jump. Therefore bird is more intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How do we know that they're not (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? No, they'll know enemy is coming, even if he says, animals they know. As soon as there is enemy, they take protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2): :</span>But they take the hook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2): :</span>But the fish take the hook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2): :</span>When the man is fishing with the hook, the fish that takes the hook...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>That ignorance is there, but the hook... Not only out of ignorance, out of greediness. That if you become more greedy, he knows that there is sufficient food in the sea, but the rascal is greedy, he's taking another... Due to his rascaldom, he's dying. Greediness. So similarly, all arrangement is there, God-made. Even for human beings. But because they're rascals, they're greedy. They're greedy. Although their greediness cannot satisfy them, everyone is greedy because the law of nature is equal to everyone. If law of nature can supply food to the birds and beast and everyone, why not to the human beings? What human being has done? But they're rascal, greedy, therefore suffering. More, wants more. There is already food grains, milk, flowers, fruits, immense supply, but he'll cut the throat of another animal. Greedy. And they're suffering, committing sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We're getting information that only in the human form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom information? Another rascal? What is that information? If you get information from another rascal, what you'll get benefit? The source of information must be perfect. Then you get information, it is all right. If you are a rascal and if you get information from another rascal, then what is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They'd say there is no perfect source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are not... You're cheater, you're cheater, you are cheated, therefore that is your version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara: :</span>We are imperfect. How do we know what a perfect source is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I do not know. Therefore it is said, tad-vijñān<span class="Italic">ā</span>rtha<span class="Italic">ṁ</span> gurum evābhigacchet. You must know from the person who knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He's also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Well his perfection is proved there is satisfaction. The so-called scientists, philosophers, politicians, they could not bring peace in the world. That is their fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We have also not brought peace in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our all followers are peaceful. We... I'm getting thousands of letters, how much you are benefited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> United Nations gets thousands of letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They get letters protest, that "You, rascal, United Nations, what you are doing for this?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, they're getting millions of dollars in contributions every year from people that think they're doing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that "in future." No. That is his philosophy. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Our philosophy also. We say we can bring peace in the world, but that's in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, but they are giving their contributions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>(aside:) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Maybe that will help them bring some peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2): :</span>But we already have peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The United Nations cannot bring peace either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> This is a question of the standard of peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (discuss among themselves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if you say like that, then United Nations is not better than us, you have to accept. If we cannot give peace, and they are not giving peace, then why they are so big organization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They will say because it is a better organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>They cannot answer. They simply give, they can give simply words, that's all. "United," they're speaking of unity, only flags are increasing. Daily another flag, another flag, another flag, and the flags will never unite. And still they are advertising "United Nations."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> When the war starts, United States...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in America, they started, United Nations, but they are going to fight with the Vietnam. United Nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Unless one is free from the material concept of life, like "I'm American," "I'm Indian," "I'm Chinese," "I'm Japanese," how can he be peaceful? Because he has got some grudge against somebody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Whereas as a devotee, he doesn't have any grudge against anybody. Therefore he's peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has a grudge against the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That's due to love for Kṛṣṇa. That's not a grudge against demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> A devotee also is merciful to the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we are not envious of the demons. Otherwise there is no need of preaching. We are trying to make the demons perfect. That is our preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Compassionate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Ah? Yes. Compassion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We are preaching that the human form of life is the most important form of any living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That human form of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...is the most important species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Developed consciousness, developed consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But somebody asks, "How do I know a bird is not more highly advanced than a human being?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> By example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Human being has created the city. The bird cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Birds also create cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their cities, their own way, not like this. Human being has constructed the skyscraper building. A bird cannot. In that sense you are advanced. That sense you are advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they say this is just our own mental concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can repair their nest with some stick, and that's all. That much they can do. But you can big, big beams, you can... That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Because even the most powerful birds we can control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, but there is no benefit. You are misusing your intelligence by skyscraper building, and they're using their intelligence to make a nest; but the benefit derived is equal. Therefore, in that sense you are less intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In other words, they never violate the laws of nature, but other..., we are backward, because we tried to fight against the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they are more advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Practically you said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That the birds are living naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, naturally. No... They have no discrimination. They have to abide by the laws of nature. But you have got discrimination; therefore you are punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So we will attract the scientists by saying that we are both fools?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Before we were saying that we were both fools. Is that the way to attract the scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No, no. That was argument. We are not fools; the scientist is fool. (devotees laugh) We are educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But how we can get them to come, to take prasādam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... Yes, give them nice prasādam, they'll come. If one scientist can be captured, many others can be captured. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana: :</span>By saying that "We have got free food, come and dine with us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But first we give them prasādam and then they come, or first they come and then we give them prasādam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just like that Dr. Wolfe came also. So gradually they'll come, because they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>But they're more interested in seeing the molecules than in taking prasādam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>That is their (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So we have to trick them to take prasādam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will (indistinct) as students not to see molecules, but to see how palatable dishes are there. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, they will forget it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time they forget their laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> You forgot your laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Just like Govinda Khorana, he got Nobel Prize about two years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So whenever he works, he never cares about anything, but he carries his only piece of paper and pen so that he can write molecules. So his consciousness is only on molecules, and he is very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. That is māyā. That is māyā. Even the pig is happy eating stool. That is māyā. <span class="Italic">Āvaraṇā</span>tmika<span class="Italic">-</span>śakti (?). Covering energy of māyā. Unless he's covered, he cannot eat and enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So these are all guided by māyā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <i class="calibre3">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇai<span class="Italic"></span></i>ḥ<i class="calibre3"> karm<span class="Italic"></span></i>āṇ<i class="calibre3">i sarvaśaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 3.27]. Prakṛt<span class="Italic">i</span> is conducting everything, as you are associating with qualities of <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span>. That I have already explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Jaya! All glories to... (end)</div>
