<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I shall learn. I shall...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they are used to cheating and so they couldn't believe Kṛṣṇa either...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> They are used to cheating and that's why they don't trust anything and anybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Sceptic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> Because they are cheaters themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sceptic is not a scientist or a man of knowledge. He's unbeliever, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Sceptic can actually not have full knowledge, he can never have full knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The scientists, they cannot understand the (indistinct), they can understand what is the relationship between the world of ideas, the world of names, and the world that they see. How can we explain what that means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is spiritual and material. The material is simply a phantasmagoria. It is the imitation of the reality. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> fifteenth chapter, find out. <span class="Italic">Ūrdhva-mūlam adhah-śākham</span> [Bg. 15.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is called mirage. In the desert the animal is finding water. There is no water in the desert. But there is water, but not in the desert. That they do not know. So this is just like desert, this material world and everything is reflection like the water. But desert there is no water, it is only reflection. <span class="Italic">Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayo yatra tri-sargo 'mṛṣā. Tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ. </span>Here everything is a transformation of three material things, fire, water, and earth, but it looks like reality. Just like the mirage, that is also <span class="Italic">tejo-vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayaḥ,</span> by reflection of the sun falling on the sand, and it looks like water. This is (indistinct). And the animal is running after water, running, running, running, when he becomes fatigued (he) dies. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But here in the material world when we look for water, we actually take it and we can drink it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not water! That you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's not water either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ūrdhva-mūlam adhah-śākham.</span> "The blessed Lord said: 'There is a banyan tree which has its roots upward and its branches down and whose leaves are the Vedic hymns. One who knows this tree is a knower of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ūrdhva-mūlam adhah-śākham</span> [Bg. 15.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Where you have experienced this tree? You have experience: a tree is <span class="Italic">adhaḥ,</span> down, a <span class="Italic">mūla,</span> the root, is down and the tree is up. And here it is said, <span class="Italic">ūrdhva-mūlam,</span> the root is up and the branches and twigs, they're down. Where you have experienced? Eh? Dr. Wolf, where you have experienced this tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> I know of it, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> I know of the tree with the fruits up and the leaves down, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> There is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We say the water. We say the reflection of a real tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> Right, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So reflection is not reality and therefore it is compared like that. It is not reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Otherwise it would be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> If it was real we would be satisfied with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So the scientists are engaged in minutely analyzing this mirage, the reflection. They're wasting their time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, now you are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We have some specific topics that we wanted to have Śrīla Prabhupāda's instruction about these things that we are going to write. So shall I discuss them very briefly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The title is "The Origin of Life and Matter," and then there will be a sub-title called "Life is a Manifestation of Life Only."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> "Life is a Manifestation of Life Only." I mean "Life Comes from Life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is the sub-title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then we have some tentative titles of the chapters and the first one is "A Unique Differentiation between a Living Spade(?) and a Non-living Matter."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This will be tentatively planned to write by me and the second chapter is "The Eternality of the Living." That's also by me. And the third chapter is called "A Look at the Natural Laws Regarding the Origin of Life and Matter." In this there are different sections. First section is quantum mechanical demonstration that will be written by Jad (?) Prabhu, he's a mathematician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And the second part of it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That theory, mathematics, you presented...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, it's his.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is very nice. You have dedicated to Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The second one is "Order Cannot Arise from Disorder." This will be based on mathematical arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is also Jad Prabhu's (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And third one is "The Statistical Disproof of Darwin's Theory." This is on advanced mathematics. That also Richard Prabhu's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And then on fourth chapter we have a section called "False Theory," namely that life originates from matter. This will be Mādhava Prabhu's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life originates from matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> False theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About false theory. Very good. (laughter) Very good, it will be very nice. You have all Kṛṣṇa's blessing, do it nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then from fifth chapter it will be evolution versus transmigration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm, yes, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And explanation. That will be written by me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And then on the sixth chapter there will be a topic called "Molecular Evolution." This will taking the jumbles of the scientific findings, but we use it as a jumbles and turn around to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So that will be by me and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">vṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya.</span> Is not that? The last chapter, what he means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, this one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is molecular evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. Molecular evolution takes place when the light is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually when they say molecular evolution, it talks only about molecules. They don't talk about life. Because they don't know what life is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they talk only about molecules. That everybody knows that molecules are around and it's evolving. But they don't know that there is life. They take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their defect. That is their defect, we want to educate them on this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And on the seventh chapter there is that Prabhupāda's, that theory of <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That will be a collective effort of all the <span class="Italic">prabhus</span> from the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti</span> is there, within our body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We want to present it in some sort of very good arguments, foundations are there. It will be our collective effort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There was another devotee, Jñāna dāsa, in Germany, who is a graduate from Oxford University, their school. And we have invited him to come to this meeting but he did not respond. Maybe he will come and help in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He has, what is his field?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh, yes. His topic was classical, statistical (indistinct) proof. That was allotted to Jñāna dāsa Prabhu, to Germany. (indistinct) Mahārāja sent a telegram, and I also personally wrote a letter saying that he should participate in writing (indistinct). He has a (indistinct) background, he told me (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is nice, attend. Kṛṣṇa will help you. They are wiping out Kṛṣṇa, and your business will be to establish Kṛṣṇa. Hm.</div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">You know this verse? Find out <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> 1.1?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take the index, otherwise how you will find out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The index.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This I want. You are nicely educated. Now by dint of your education, you prove that background is Kṛṣṇa, that's all. Then your education will be perfect. Otherwise you are one of these fools and rascals, that's all. The particular type of education, mathematics, chemistry, physics, what you have learned after working so hard, now you should by your educational-departmental education-you prove that the background is Kṛṣṇa. Then your education is perfect. That is the verse, <span class="Italic">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Learned circles have positively concluded that the infallible purpose of the advancement of knowledge, namely austerities, study of the Vedas, sacrifice, chanting of hymns and charity, culminate in the transcendental descriptions of the Lord, who is defined in choice poetry."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. "Human intellect is developed for advancement of learning in art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology, economics, politics, etc. By culture of such knowledge the human society can attain perfection of life. This perfection of life culminates in the realization of the Supreme Being, Viṣṇu. The <span class="Italic">śruti</span> therefore directs that those who are actually advanced in learning should aspire for the service of Lord Viṣṇu. Unfortunately persons who are enamored by the external beauty of <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā</span> do not understand that culmination of perfection or self-realization..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature, <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā,</span> nature. They are bewildered simply by seeing the nature. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-māyā</span> means sense enjoyment which is transient and miserable. Those who are entrapped by <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-māyā</span> utilize advancement of knowledge for sense enjoyment. Śrī Nārada Muni has explained that all paraphernalia of the cosmic universe is but an emanation from the Lord out of His different energies because the Lord has set in motion, by His inconceivable energy, the actions and reactions of the created manifestation. They have come to be out of His energy, they rest on His energy, and after annihilation they merge into Him. Nothing is, therefore, different from Him, but at the same time the Lord is always different from them.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"> When advancement of knowledge is applied in the service of the Lord, the whole process becomes absolute. The Personality of Godhead and His transcendental name, fame, glory, etc., are all nondifferent from Him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Absolute, that is absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "Therefore, all the sages and devotees of the Lord have recommended that the subject matter of art, science, philosophy, physics, chemistry, psychology and all other branches of knowledge should be wholly and solely applied in the service of the Lord. Art, literature, poetry, painting, etc., may be used in glorifying the Lord. The fiction writers, poets and celebrated litterateurs are generally engaged in writing of sensuous subjects, but if they turn towards the service of the Lord they can describe the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. Vālmīki was a great poet, and similarly Vyāsadeva is a great writer, and both of them have absolutely engaged themselves in delineating the transcendental activities of the Lord and by so doing have become immortal. Similarly, science and philosophy also should be applied in the service of the Lord. There is no use presenting dry speculative theories for sense gratification. Philosophy and science should be engaged to establish the glory of the Lord. Advanced people are eager to understand the Absolute Truth through the medium of science, and therefore a great scientist should endeavor to prove the existence of the Lord on a scientific basis. Similarly, all other branches of knowledge should always be engaged in the service of the Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also the same is affirmed. All "knowledge" not engaged in the service of the Lord is but nescience. Real utilization of advanced knowledge is to establish the glories of the Lord, and that is the real import. Scientific knowledge engaged in the service of the Lord and all similar activities are all factually <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana,</span> or glorification of the Lord."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is perfection. If you can write this book nicely all together, it will be a great service to Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa will bless you and help you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Will you read the rest of the chapters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then in the eighth chapter there will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just make that Dr. Agarwala also interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, he can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is the also scientist, professor of physics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> "Defects and Errors in Scientific Research," it will be a title and we will find out all the mistakes that normally found in scientific research. That will be written by Mādhava Prabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And add "and how to make it perfect." Find out the defects. Don't be, what is called...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Negative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Negative only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, we want to bring the, our four defects in our sense perception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense perception is defective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, there are four defects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you go beyond the sense perception, that is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That will be Mādhava Prabhu's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then on the ninth chapter there will be a topic, "The Ultimate Research," (indistinct) research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ultimate research is to find out the brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Absolute. Then there is no more defect. Everything is perfect. That is stated, <span class="Italic">dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi. Nirasta-kuhakam,</span> where there is no defect, that is <span class="Italic">vaikuṇṭha-dhāma. Dhāmnā svena nirasta-kuhakaṁ paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi. </span>The absolute truth, we offer our respectful... That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam. Nirasta-kuhakam,</span> where these defects cannot enter. Just like sunshine, in the sun, darkness cannot enter. There is no possibility of darkness going there. Is it possible? So similarly, in Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa sūrya-sama; māyā andhakāra</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 22.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> there is no question of defect there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Read that other verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In this respect I wanted to phase this on (indistinct) that ultimate research, that <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-jijñāsā.</span> That is beginning of knowledge, what is the absolute truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is the research topic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Now this subject matter should be taken up seriously in the human form of life, that is the suggestion. <span class="Italic">Atha, atha, ataḥ, </span>now you have got this human form of life, therefore you discuss about the absolute truth. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ satyaṁ dhīmahi.</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Next one is, next chapter is "Matter Originates from Life." That one of Dāsa (?) Prabhu's. And on the eleventh chapter there will be (indistinct)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Matter is a manifestation of life's energy. We can daily experience. The matter, hair is growing. Cut, again growing. Why? Because there is life. Dead body, hair never grows. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhava:</span> Well the scientists will say it's just recombination of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, when there is body dead, no hair grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's a nice example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can use some bombastic word but we layman, we see this is the position. And you do not know how it is being done but the energy is there in you. That is called <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti,</span> inconceivable energy. That is there. Now you shave every morning and next morning, again millions of hairs. You do not know how it is being happening. But it is happening, and this is called <span class="Italic">acintya-śakti.</span> From Kṛṣṇa such big, big things are coming out. Even Kṛṣṇa may not know but Kṛṣṇa has got the inconceivable by which it is coming. The same example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> People will speculate so many theories as to why the hairs are coming out but then after some time they will see that theory is wrong they'll have to present a new one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> And until they come to understand that Kṛṣṇa is pushing it, then they will never understand what's actually causing everything to grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> False ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So give something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The last chapter is entitled "Intellectual Amalgam, Psycho-social Implications." That will be Rūpānuga...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It was their idea. In a book like this there has to be some social conclusion as to the effects of such atheistic theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the people are being misguided. That we want to stop. They have got this human form of body, that is an opportunity to understand himself and God and act accordingly. Now they are being misled. It is a social disservice. Cheating. In the name of scientist, they are exploiting this innocent person, taking their money and spoiling it without any good result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> My idea is that they are... Actually the scientists are preaching void. They are preaching to the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the necessity of preaching void? Void is void, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There's nothing to say about that. But because they're saying that, the people think that at the time of death there's nothing, so they want sense gratification. So the scientists are selling them their gadgets. They're selling them cars and things to keep them in sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can see when a man is in coma, he cries, he suffers. Before death when a man is in coma sometimes tears come. Now why he says there is nothing? Imperfect knowledge, that's all. Misguiding people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The last chapter's the nicest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The last chapter is-that Śrīla Prabhupāda suggested-that was "The Original Idea is Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is the concluding chapter. That will be a collective effort from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, do it. Sincerely pray to Kṛṣṇa and He will give intelligence. Now write nicely. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām, dadāmi buddhi-yogam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">,</span> Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence. <span class="Italic">Yena mām upayānti te,</span> such intelligence which will help him to come back home, back to Me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> If we are strong in the principles, then we will have the intelligence to write this book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa will give the intelligence. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It will take us some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may take, that is... But do it very nicely. How many pages will it be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We plan about 500.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Then we shall immediately publish. What (is) the title you have given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's called "The Origin of Life and Matter." The origin of everything. When one talks about the life here in the material world, one cannot leave matter. Because the scientists, what they are doing, is the materialists taken it for granted. They do not ask who made this matter. So they've started at... "Oh, matter is already, given by nature." So they'll take the matter and then start life. That is their increasing. So we want to bring it that matter is also from life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That's like saying the car produces the driver. That's what they're thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The car necessitates the driver's service. Otherwise car is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Neither is the driver dependent on the car for his existence. He doesn't need the car. The car needs him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They also say that the car created itself somehow or other, the metal and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the fact. Car requires the help of the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I have interest for these journals, say life, origin of life, that started from last year. So here the international scientists from all over the world, they have combined together and then they formed this, this is all chemicals, this. And they're a big group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you protest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, that's what we're starting the background.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Refute their arguments, then it will be nice. <span class="Italic">Aiye</span> (Hindi-Prabhupāda greets guests and asks which province of India they come from and they reply Punjab). How long you are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> (Hindi) Emory University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, Emory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, Emory. (Hindi-explains that he works at the Primate Center)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are doing research on primates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I work on the nervous system of primates, trying to find out the effect of broking (?) malnutrition of the mother on the developing fetus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the field where the scientists are trying to prove that life is originated from matter, this type of research work. I called the director of that institute a couple of days ago and I told him I wanted to look around. And he told me that we need a formal application in order to visit that center so I'm going to make. (to guest:) Ordinarily in there, what do they do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There are a number of projects and there are a number of disciplines in which people work. Mine is experimental nutrition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are also believing that life comes from matter? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I don't think we think in those directions at all. We simply just conduct experiments, not knowing what they will lead to and try to describe whatever we see under the microscope. (indistinct) chemical matters that we use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But I think you have assumed that Darwin's theory or theory of evolution is already there and even to study something intermediate, higher levels, evolution is all right but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basic means evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they want to study more some of the intermediate stages like this metabolism in some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother's, mother's body? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Any system, mother's body or any living systems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What I can do is to study the growth and differentiation of the nervous system, different parts of the nervous system and how it is affected by lack of protein in the diet of the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because all over the developing world there are millions of mothers who would not get any great quantities of protein while they are pregnant. In the first instance before they are pregnant, they are not nutritionally prepared for having another burden of a baby inside their body, and without that adequate preparation when they become pregnant, this is a double stress on their physiological systems. And we would like to see how the baby gets affected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if by chance there is baby, killing. Is that the conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, our conclusions just say that there is a critical period in the development of the baby that if it does not get any good nutrition at that time, then he's likely to be retarded in many respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The number of cells that he comes equipped with is less than the normal and number of enzymes that must be equipped in certain proportions do not come in the right proportion so that the later functioning is not to the mark. Therefore full and cognitive ability is very much affected. So what we are trying to do is-hopefully in the next five years we can do it-is to define a critical period. We do not know yet what is a critical period. We are talking of a very large time, large span of time, but most probably it is only a few months period in which if the baby is supplied very well, at least then our system will not be affected. His body may be affected. By the lunch program in a school they have been able to improve very much the physical characteristics of the body but if the mental mischief has been done, it is done. It cannot be corrected later on. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now this killing of the babies are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You mean abortions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and not abortion, killing, regular killing. Sometimes they kill, the doctors. So it is going to be supported, like that, scientific research?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, Swamiji, it's a matter of opinion when the mentally fetus becomes an individual. If you think that as soon as it is conceived, it is an individual-of course it is because it's going to grow into one-then of course it's killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You believe that the child in the womb is not individual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I don't have any personal thoughts about it though. But I think if a woman thinks that she is not suited as a mother...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why she has sex?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, in this present world I think, you know, sex is not for procreation, it is more for fun. I think ninety-nine percent of the couples who indulge in sex do not think of children at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's true. But this is also true that ninety-nine percent people when they indulge in it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ninety-nine percent may be all rascals and fools, that is not true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> For the common, I think masses, some practical means are needed rather than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical is that our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says that <span class="Italic">pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt, na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> The idea is that one should not become a father, one should not become a mother, unless they know how to make his child immortal. Because soul is immortal but he is entangled in this material body, therefore death takes place. Actually soul is not born, <span class="Italic">na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span> So this process is going on, transmigration of the soul from one body to another, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> The father and mother should be so enlightened and educate the son in such a way that this is the last acceptance of material body. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">,</span> he may not accept again this material body. If the father and mother is determined in that way, then they should become parents, otherwise no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, I think, you know, you are very right but we are the one in India who face this problem the most. We should not have gone to this stage which we are, six hundred million people. I think the most of us are, you know, procreating without any thoughts about the next generation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is not for Indian and European, that is for everyone. That ignorance and knowledge is everywhere. It is not the Indian or American. That ignorance is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But Swamiji, while the family norm here in the western countries is 2.3 children per couple, we still have a family norm of about six children per family. You know I think there are a lot of cultural factors that are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that shastric injunction is, that is spiritual restraint. Therefore one should train himself when to have sex life or when to become father, when not to become. That education... Not to become like animal, dogs and cats, whenever there is sex desire, we must have. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi. </span>Find out this, <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, do you recognize that India does need some method at this point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are speaking of India. Everyone needs, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because we are the most unfortunate one that with only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are unfortunate because you are now following misleaders. You do not follow the real leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have only 2.4 percent of the land area and we support 16% of the human population. You see this land...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is due to your ignorance. You have followed the so-called rascal politicians. You have not followed Kṛṣṇa. Therefore this misfortune is there. Misguided. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Everything comes from the mother earth. We are in very short supply of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No shortage. That is everything supply. You have got the Vedic knowledge. You don't take care of that. You now manufacture your own knowledge. Now there is knowledge, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is perfect knowledge, but even a political leader like Gandhi, he says that I don't believe that there was anybody like Kṛṣṇa living. This is your leader. All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> big, big <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Śaṅkarācārya, big, big, stalwart, learned, they have accepted Kṛṣṇa. Now Gandhi says, "I don't believe." Now you are guided by Gandhi, you are not guided by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> That is your misfortune. You are not guided by Kṛṣṇa. You are guided by Dr. Radhakrishnan. That is the misfortune. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> one blind man is being, is following another blind man. That is going on. That is going on all over the world, not only in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think Mahatma Gandhi followed the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> all these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he did not believe in Kṛṣṇa and he followed <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just try to understand the psychology. He says plainly that I do not believe there was anybody Kṛṣṇa, living ever. And he's following Kṛṣṇa's instruction. Just see his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, he must have also answered this question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no questioning. If you do not believe in somebody, how you are reading His book of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's my point also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so therefore... This kind of leader we are following, contradictory. That is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji we are not following any person but we do see the realities all around the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Realities... If you have no knowledge, what do you know about reality? If you have no knowledge, then what is reality, what is non-reality, how can you know? If your knowledge is imperfect, then how you can say reality? Suppose beyond this wall you cannot see, and how you can speak of the reality beyond this wall? That is misfortune. You do not see what is there clearly, and you are speaking on the reality. Your senses are defective. What do you know about reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In the spiritual level yes, we are very blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But at the material level, at the level where people eat their food and live their lives, I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also on account of presence of the spirit soul. Actually it... Whatever little you are doing on account of presence of the spirit soul, as soon as the spirit soul is gone then your body and senses are simply lump of matter. So you are working with that lump of matter on account of presence of the spirit soul. Therefore that is more important. To understand what is that spirit soul, how it is working, what is his position, that, that is real knowledge. Therefore Kṛṣṇa begins in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> first lesson, about the spirit soul, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So you are studying the <span class="Italic">deha,</span> that we are discussing just now. One is studying the motor car but he has no knowledge of the driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I venture very humbly to this opportunity of saying something I've experienced so much with people, that they would say, "Oh yes, we are ready to respect the spiritual values, but we live in this real world, in this material world and so we would rather not have the spiritual values interfere with it, settle everything in the material sense."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they, what they are saying, "real world," that is unreal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolf:</span> They don't realize that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their knowledge is so imperfect, they're taking <span class="Italic">asatyere satya kori māni. Asatyere, </span>you understand Bengali? <span class="Italic">Asatyere satya kori māni, a</span>ccepting the untruth as truth. <span class="Italic">Asatyere nitāi-pada pāsariyā, ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā nitāi-pada pāsariyā, asatyere satya kori māni, </span>by forgetting our relationship with God and being proud of their so-called... [break] That motor car is not your life. That is being misguided. Everyone is thinking that this body, motor car, is everything. But within, the driver, he's starving. So how long he'll carry on this motor car. So first of all take care of the driver who will protect this motor car nicely. And if the driver is a nonsense, he's starving, then how can I expect the car will go very nicely. It will create disaster. Disaster means... Suppose you have got very nice car, Cadillac or, many good cars there are, Rolls-Royce, and he smashes. Then he'll get ordinary car. This human body is smashed... [break] <span class="Italic">...hāntara-prāptiḥ,</span> you enter into the dog's body, finished. That is not in your control, that is God's control, nature's control. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> it is not under your control or so-called science. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">, kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">,</span> these things are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Do you think Swamiji, the scientists would be able to create life as they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was discussing, that is foolishness. That is-I was discussing-life is never created, life is already there. The body is created. So they are going on on a wrong theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think our definition of life is a little different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may define differently, that is your concern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We are talking about a protoplasm, something that moves. It may not have the soul, it may not have any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "May not have," that means you have no real knowledge, "may not have." "May not have," that is not knowledge. I say, "May have." Then what is the difference between you and me? "May not have," that is not knowledge. That is simply suggestion, speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Want me to give examples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have to take knowledge from the perfect. Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span>" You have to take that knowledge. You cannot say you are perfect and you'll say, "May not have." And what is this knowledge, "May not have"? Say definitely and prove it, scientifically. That is knowledge. "Perhaps," "May not," "May be," these are not knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Just to give one example, these days the science experiments have conclusively done that a particular egg can be in the body of the womb, can be manipulated into either a male or a female.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We say the soul is within the body so you can make it male or female, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. We are not concerned with male and female, we are concerned with the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Science does manipulate life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe, even if you manipulate, then what you have done? You cannot create the soul, that is not possible. If you manipulate life then give the dead body again energy to rise up. Then we shall (admit) that you can manipulate. Otherwise it is false. If you are so expert in manipulation, then give the dead body life again. That is my request. If depend on others and you manipulating, this false knowledge will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, what actually I was coming to, most humbly, cannot spread to the (indistinct) science go together. It's not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if science is really science, that is helpful. If science is based on wrong theory, then what is the use of that. Everything is wrong. So many mathematical calculation, if there is any item wrong, then whole thing is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So we are all moving in the darkness, ignorance, to begin with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that if you admit then you will get knowledge. But that is not the position. You are falsely proud that you are very advanced in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No Swamiji, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are qualified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Even for a small experiment, I don't pretend that we know anything, whatever it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually that is the position, therefore our business is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa demands that, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then Kṛṣṇa will give you intelligence how to become perfect.</div>
<div class="Verse">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<br class="calibre2"/>dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam...<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>10.10]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the process. You take instruction from Kṛṣṇa, the perfect. Don't be proud of your paltry knowledge. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement that Kṛṣṇa is perfect and take knowledge from Him-you'll be perfect. That is our proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That we believe in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are not perfect. We can speculate only and that is not perfection. "Maybe," "perhaps," like that. No definite knowledge. The definite knowledge you can get from Kṛṣṇa, the perfect. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> accept Kṛṣṇa. We have to follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas, ācāryopāsanam.</span> So in India all these <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Śaṅkarācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Lord Caitanya, they accept Kṛṣṇa the supreme absolute. Why you should not? Are you more than these <span class="Italic">ācāryas?</span> Then? That is the defect of modern education, they manufacture education although they're imperfect. They have no the common sense that "I am imperfect, how I am manufacturing education and becoming teacher. My becoming teacher is cheating because I have no perfect knowledge." Knowledge means it must be perfect, not "maybe," "perhaps." This is not knowledge. Definite knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But to bring some message of truth to the people all over the world which are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the message is there, Kṛṣṇa's message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Four billion, we need some people who will say, "I am the teachers."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that we are teaching, that you take Kṛṣṇa as the authority. Don't go to the rascals. All problems will be solved. But they are going to the rascals, instead of going to Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> You mean Swamiji then that all scientific efforts, whatever they are, should be stopped altogether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not stopped. Just like you have got ordinary car and you purchase a Rolls-Royce car. The business is the same. It is simply an artistic improvement. In the ordinary car there is much jerking and the Rolls-Royce car there is no jerking. That will not benefit you. After all it is car. You can use it for going here to there, there to here, that's all. Therefore our Vedic civilization, they are not very much eager to manufacture a motor car, they are satisfied with the bullock cart. Because after all you have to go from this place to that place. And there was no need of big, big roads, three thousand miles long for driving the car. You see. The bullock cart was sufficient, here to there, a few miles. But they were interested to cultivate spiritual knowledge. That is Indian civilization. Vyāsadeva was living in a cottage and just see literature. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita was prime minister of India and he was living in a cottage, drawing no salary and he has given his politics and moral lesson, so sublime. So here at the present moment, the motor car civilization, he's anxious how to get a Rolls-Royce motor car, that's all. That is his business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> When you say Swamiji, very humbly I would like to know, that scientific inventions should not be stopped, what should be the actual <span class="Italic">modus operandi</span> continuum on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Modus... <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>,</span> to enquire of the absolute truth. <span class="Italic">Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā nārtho yaś ceha karmabhiḥ, karma </span>you should do but the <span class="Italic">kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ,</span> find out this verse. (aside:) You can close this door. <span class="Italic">Kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ,</span> our desires should not be engaged for sense gratification. That is going on. All desires, all improvement, all science, they are being... Just like you were speaking about the protein deficiency. That is all concerning the body. Body means senses. There is no higher study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That we admit that there's not very high study and it's not something final but I think some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that protein fooding supply... Suppose the birds and bees, they have no research institute. They have sufficient protein supply, this supply and that supply by nature. An elephant has got so big body and so much strength that they have not found it by your scientific research. The nature is supplying. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">,</span> it is being done. Why you are wasting time in this way? You study what is <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> and what is behind <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> That is real study. The protein supply is already being done. Just like a cow is eating grass and she's supplying milk, full of protein, so do you think the protein is coming from the grass? Can you eat grass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Something must be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some... That is something, then there's no perfect knowledge. That is not perfect knowledge. It is... Everyone knows the cow does not take any protein food, it takes on the grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Grass is quite rich in protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you take, why you are searching after protein?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because we cannot digest the fibre in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then it is not suitable for you. Therefore nature's arrangement is that protein can be produced through the body of the cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think Swamiji, nature's arrangement was not made for (indistinct) human beings that we have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature was defective, you mean to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I mean nature's way is designed as a ecological balance of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature's... If you follow the nature's law, then everything is there. If you deviate (from) the nature's law, then that is defective. (indistinct-some guests reply all together)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, nature's balance has been upset by us, us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Therefore I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Otherwise there would not be that many human beings here. It was all the time checked by nature's forces. We have just constrained nature by our efforts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is, that is my point that nature is doing. As soon as you violate nature, then you become defective. That is... Therefore one should live natural life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāmasya nendriya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Do you want me to read this, <span class="Italic">kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India? No, I'm not speaking of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāmasya nendriya-prītiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, <span class="Italic">kāma,</span> yes. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "Life's desires should never be aimed at gratifying the senses."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read the verses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">kāmasya nendriya-prītir<br class="calibre2"/>lābho jīveta yāvatā<br class="calibre2"/>jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā<br class="calibre2"/>nārtho yaś ceha karmabhiḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.10]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the meaning that <span class="Italic">kāmasya,</span> we have got some demands of the body. That does not mean it is meant for sense gratification. We require something, <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunam,</span> these four things are the demands of the body. We must eat something, we must sleep for some time, we must have sex life also, we must defend. That is all right but not for sense gratification. That a child is required, progeny is required, for that sex life is good, but they are using sex life for pleasure and killing the child. And implicated in sinful activities and therefore suffering. And scientists encouraging them, "Yes, you can kill child."Why should you create child and kill him? That nonsense, they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This nonsense thing has created all problems. Therefore Vedic civilization is-first teaching is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span>-how to learn to avoid sex life. If one can continue without sex life he is praised, <span class="Italic">naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī.</span> If one cannot, all right you become a perfect <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> So many rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">Dharmāviruddhaḥ kāma,</span> that is all right, but if you use sex life for sense gratification and becomes implicated in so many sinful activities, then how he'll be happy? A sinful man cannot become happy, that is not possible. All our sinful activities, the so-called scientists are helping, "Yes, you can do this." And the church is sanctioning. This is going on. The Christian religion says, "Thou shalt not kill," and they are now teaching, "yes, you can kill the child. You have killed cows and so many things, that is all right. Again you kill your child."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swami, can I ask you a very silly question which has been asked to us a lot of times and we don't have a satisfactory answer, to whit: why is the cow sacred and not the other animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it gives milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But there are a lot... Buffaloes give milk too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In larger quantities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, milk means it is scientifically proven, milk means cow's milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But what about the killing of those cows which are not the milching type, as cows that are being bred here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, killing is sinful. Christ said, "Thou shalt not kill." That is sinful, it doesn't matter whether you kill cow or goat or anything. But from economic point of view, cow is very important because it supplies milk. And milk preparation, we Indians know how many you can get nice milk preparation. <span class="Italic">Dahi, rābṛi,</span> this, that, Huh? But how nutritious, how palatable. And that is good for human being. First thing is that why you should kill if you have got sufficient food, eh? <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Eh? Vegetables, fruits, then food grains, then sugar, everything is there sufficient. At least we Indian, we know we can prepare hundreds and thousands of preparations, nice palatable, enjoyable. Why should you go to kill the animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well scientists claim that meat ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists, first of all we have rejected that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...provides excellent quantity of proteins. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But however protein you may accumulate, can you stop your death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is value of protein? If you think that protein will save you from death, then you collect the best protein. But after all, you are going to die. Nature will not allow you to live, even you take much quantity of protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all make solution that you will not die. Then try to find out best protein. What is your answer about this birth, death, old age and disease? Can you check it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? You take protein, why you are becoming old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The researches, though they have been made, they are imperfect again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They are imperfect, surely imperfect. "Maybe," "perhaps." (laughs) (indistinct) But scientists say that Rome was not built in a day. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Indian civilization is that you take rice, wheat, <span class="Italic">ḍāl,</span> vegetable, a little milk, whatever protein and vitamin A,B,C,D can be available, that is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Dr. Malhotra has done excellent work on nutrition and he has done two books. In those books he has advocated that milk is not the only best diet. Balanced food, you can have by I mean <span class="Italic">ḍāls</span> and so many other sources.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Milk is not the only one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In, in, in your Punjab, in United Province...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> At least his (indistinct) approach it is not one sided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, my main question is although spiritualism is the Absolute Truth, can we not in some way make spiritualism in such a way, modify it in such a way, as to help the common people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The masses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They have been steeped in ignorance for such a long time, it will take a long time to bring them into the fold of spiritualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it has been made easy by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. That you don't commit sinful activities and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and don't commit sinful life, that's all. And sinful life we have given them, no illicit sex-we don't say, "no sex"-no illicit sex, no illicit sex, no meat eating. Suppose... They are not now eating meat, are they unhealthy? They are known now as bright-faced. So no illicit sex, no meat eating, no intoxication, and no gambling. This is avoiding sinful life. And chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Do you see the result? Do you see the result? Within four, five years how they have advanced. Not that they're Vedantists or they have studied all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, not that. Simple thing. Have you ever come here in the evening when they perform <span class="Italic">ārati, kīrtana?</span> Just see how ecstatic it is. Simple thing. Don't commit sinful activities and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">bas</span>. You'll become elevated. Jagāi, Mādhāi, they were-in those days, because they were drunkards, women hunters, meat-eaters-they were considered most sinful. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu delivered them by this process. There were two Jagāi and Mādhāi and now hundreds and thousands of Jagāis and Mādhāis are becoming purified.<span class="Italic"> Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo, hari-nāme uddhārilo, tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi.</span> Everyone wants evidence. Huh? <span class="Italic">Pāpī-tāpī,</span> all sinful men were delivered simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. So you may ask what is the evidence? <span class="Italic">Tāra sākṣī jagāi mādhāi,</span> the evidence is here, <span class="Italic">jagāi mādhāi</span>. So not that Jagāi, Mādhāi five hundred years ago, now see at the present moment. They did not come to me after studying all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>, and Vedantists. They come to me, I ask them that, "Don't commit these sinful activities and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."That's all. Everyone can do, even the child can do. So you are all educated men, you study this philosophy, try to understand, also join. It is your duty, because you are Indian. Caitanya Mahāprabhu entrusted this mission to the Indians.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Indians are meant for doing good to others. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. An Indian can become perfect because there is all the Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Janma sārthaka kari'.</span> First of all you become perfect then preach the knowledge for other's benefit. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's. Now our leaders say, "Throw away these all <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> in the water." This is going on. And what they have gained by throwing away? And actually government is against us, against my movement in India. What can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> At this time I think India also needs as much spiritual movement as anybody else in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> At this time I think India itself needs as much as spiritual needs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We are as much backwards as anybody else in the world, probably more so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we have lost our original culture and we could not take the Western culture. So we are in the wilderness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because here the average man takes more interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are fed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Whereas in India the average man doesn't even take interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he knows, "What is this Hare Kṛṣṇa? We know it, now reject it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> An average Indian, I think he will not be able to tell you how many chapters there are in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have never been taught. But still they are Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we hold our meeting in India twenty thousand, thirty thousand people come still, because by nature they are inclined. By artificial means they are being subdued. And in every step I can feel-they are not openly saying-the government is giving me trouble. They don't want this movement may go on nicely in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But rules cannot be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that cannot be suppressed, that cannot be suppressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...cannot be subdued, even if this prime minister or Mahatma Gandhi, (indistinct) of Lord Kṛṣṇa and this and that. That is foolishness (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> This is Dr. Fenton, Prabhupāda, he's a professor of religion at Emory University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! Very good. Hm. (aside) What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Its twenty of two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Can we touch your feet, Swamiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come... You can offer your obeisances. Hm, so that is the father's duty to see the child is grown completely spiritual, so that he may not have to come again in the mother's womb. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. (Indian guests leave and devotees offer obeisances.) I talk with the professor of religion sometimes, "What is the meaning of religion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is that college you are employed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Emory University. Its about three miles from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what definition you give to religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> It has to do with saving, something that binds societies together, it has to do with the supernatural of (indistinct) God. And hm... Sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That there is relationship with God. Is it not? Religion has got relationship with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Yes, but sometimes it's simply something that holds a society together. Both are religion. Sometimes religion is shameful, sometimes its man's highest glory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm... (aside) You come here, I could not follow him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He says sometimes religion is shameful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shame.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Shameful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that shameful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Shameful, something a... Not good. Uh, disgraceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Ashamed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> There is a false religion and there's... Sometimes religion is the most glorious thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no standard definition of religion. Sometimes this, sometimes that, like that. What is the definition...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) ...there seems to be no standard definition of religion sometimes its this and sometimes that. Isn't there something more definitive you could...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Oh no, the more I study it, the more it slips through my fingers. I've been teaching for fourteen years and still don't know what I'm teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Christian religion, what it is teaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Christian? It is the humanization of man, to trust in Lord Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And why trust Lord Jesus Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Because he is the root to reality, the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's son of God, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Yes, but I personally am not that orthodox. That is the orthodox teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Teaching must be orthodox, otherwise what is the value? If the teaching changes, that is not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Well, it may be that it changed in the early history of Christianity through Greek influence on its Jewish background.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is changing now also, they are so... Change is of the material world, in the spiritual world there is no change, absolute. In the relative world there is change. So our definition of religion is little different from the worldly definition. Our definition... "Our" means there should be the real definition: religion means the laws which are given by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> <span class="Italic">Sanātana-dharma</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. <span class="Italic">Sanātana...</span> Yes, religion should be <span class="Italic">sanātana. Sanātana</span> means there cannot be any change. Just like every living being eats, you cannot change it. You cannot say that this living entity is not eating. Apart from human society, even in animal society, a living being eats. This is his religion. Sleeps, has sex, these are eternal characteristics. Similarly, religion means spiritual characteristics. That spiritual characteristic is also pervertedly reflected in the material world. Just like every one is servant. Anyone, any one of us, we are all servant. You are serving the University. He is serving the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He is serving, serving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is serving International Society. I am serving Kṛṣṇa, or he is serving Kṛṣṇa, like that. So everyone is serving, this is religion. To remain a servant. It does not mean that the Hindus are only servant, or Muslims are servant and Christians are not. Everyone is servant. Is it not a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> I hope it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That servitude or service has to be rendered to God. That is perfection of service. So that is religion. We are serving, I am serving this, you are serving that, you are serving... But when that service is rendered to God, Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect service, perfect, perfection aḥ... satisfaction, that is religion. According to Sanskrit dictionary or what is it called? The dictionary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sanskrit dictionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa, God, is demanding that you surrender. This surrender business is of the servant. Just like I can say to my servant, "Just hear me what I say, do it." And he does it. That is servant. A servant cannot dictate, the master can dictate. Servant is to obey the dictation of the master. That is religion. When the servant obeys the dicta... (aside-indistinct) Hm. Take this picture, keep there. This picture, here, here. You come here. Take this vase down. Yes. We... God is great. God is great. Do you understand? God is great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Great.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we are subordinate. Is it not our position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Fenton:</span> Being servant, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our position. God is maintainer and we are maintained. God is predominator and we are predominated. This is our position. We are not equal to God, neither over God. We are always subordinate. And why you are subordinate? Because He maintains us. That is the difference between God and ourselves. He is the supreme being and we are subordinate being. We are maintained by God. That is Vedic instruction. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13) This is understanding of God. He is <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> He's eternal, and we are also eternal because we are samples of God. God is great and perfect and in our this position we are subordinate, and in material condition we are imperfect. So even if we become perfect, still we remain subordinate. Therefore our position is always to abide by the orders of God. This is religion. When we abide by the orders of God, then we are religious. When we do not, then we are demons or Satan. (speaks with arriving guests in Hindi, inviting them to come in and asking whether they have been to the temple in Vṛndāvana) Religion means to remain faithful to God and abide by His order. That is religion. (end)</div>
