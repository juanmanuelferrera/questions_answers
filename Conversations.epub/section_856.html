<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...speaking <span class="Italic">karmī</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> has no desires to fulfill, whereas the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> has unlimited desires to fulfill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> desires to carry out the order of Kṛṣṇa, and the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> is interested in satisfying himself, gratification of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> is also working and <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is also working. Then what is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One is working for his own sense satisfaction and the other is working for the sense satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Mentality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> The devotee is peaceful, ever peaceful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmī</span>.... Just like, I began this Kṛṣṇa consciousness business with forty rupees, eh, in New York. Now, say within eight or ten years we have got forty <span class="Italic">crores.</span> What is the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> who started his business with forty rupees and within ten years, eight years, has got forty <span class="Italic">crores</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Therefore the difference is the <span class="Italic">karmī's</span> not successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is never unsuccessful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Karmī</span>.... Just like this house you have got. For a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> to invest so much money, it will takes fifty years. We got this by donation. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nobody's going to come up to a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> and give him six hundred thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So after $600,000 for a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> it will take six hundred years. (laughter) For a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> somebody comes, "Take it." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like we all have so many watches. You'll notice everyone in our society has watches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They haven't got, <span class="Italic">karmīs</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Some of them do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the idea? You are asking question? Without have watches? We can live without watches? What is the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well they're..., usually they'll say we're.... If we are supposed to be spiritualists, then why do we have so many cars, why do we have so many watches, why do we have so many different things that they can see are there within the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We acquire them without any effort. We are not after these things. But Kṛṣṇa sends, we take-so many cars, so many watches, so many houses for propaganding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why shall I be greedy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Simply we are preaching and everything comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything necessary. Whatever is necessary will come. Kṛṣṇa has supplied. For us there is no such distinction as "material" and "spiritual." Because this material, so-called material, that is God's creation. When it is used for God, that is spiritual. Who has created this tree? You have created? Man has created this tree? Who has created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when it is used for Kṛṣṇa.... Just like these rascals, they do not know. They wanted to use it for themselves. It is ugly, no fruit. We see near Bombay, they have got so many coconuts. How beautiful it is with fruits and leaves. Because we use it for Kṛṣṇa. (indistinct) "Oh, they have got fear(?). The coconuts will fall down on your head." (everyone laughs) And they make it ugly. They kill children, but we, we're training children how they're offering obeisances. We do not kill. We beg them Kṛṣṇa conscious. So our activity all spiritual. [break] ...afraid of population. We say "Create any number of population, but make them Kṛṣṇa conscious." That is our restriction, that if you cannot make your children Kṛṣṇa conscious, then don't beget. And if you can do that, then hundred children can be got. <span class="Italic">Na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum.</span> This is our.... We say that if you cannot beget Kṛṣṇa conscious child, don't become father and mo.... And if you can produce Kṛṣṇa conscious children, then become father and mother hundreds of children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are always in anxiety about something or other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they're always fearing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They think that if the population increases at the rate that it's going now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, whatever they think, we say increase any number of population, but make them Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our program. We are not afraid of population. They are rascals. They're thinking that they feed people. We don't think that. We know Kṛṣṇa is feeding. But if he's a rascal, we don't want. We don't want to feed the rascals, we want feed the devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> If the population increases at the rate it is now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them increase. We don't care for it. We can maintain any number of population. Let them come and become Kṛṣṇa conscious. We're not afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It appears from the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book that there were many billions of people more on this planet when Kṛṣṇa was here than there is now. And they had no problems then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only that, we have got from history. They were begetting hundreds of children. There was no scarcity of food. And who is begetting now one hundred children? Ha? One or two or at utmost.... Utmost eight, ten. Wrong theory, population increasing. Rascal's theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's just that they don't know how to manage nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't know how to manage nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There's so many, so much land vacant all over the world-Australia, Africa, South America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Why would someone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious have a hundred children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Why would someone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious have one hundred children? For example, why would someone like Dhṛtarāṣṭra, who is not particularly Kṛṣṇa conscious...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he was Kṛṣṇa conscious. In those days everyone was Kṛṣṇa conscious. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's only a certain amount of grain. There's only a certain amount of water. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's some theories, where they think that there's only a certain amount of grains...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their theories we don't accept. There's so much water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But, therefore, if they don't, if you don't work to conserve it, then everyone will starve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After all, you produce it, then conserve. These rascals, do they produce water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he's anxious to conserve it? It is not his production. That is rascaldom. Ha. He has taken from some other sources, and he wants to conserve it. He does not think that "I did not produce it. It has come to me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well they don't know how it's produced. So what's there they're gonna have to save, because they're not certain that there'll be any more supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The sense is that if I'm not produced, then even if I conserve the proper..., the supply may be stopped. Because it is, there is no control over, of me. Suppose you have got some water. How long it will be conserved? Ha? The water supply is stopped. Now suppose it's the ocean. There's enough water, but if Kṛṣṇa desires, it will be dried up. Then, where you will get water? So what is the meaning of their such conserving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enormous. Why should we bother about conserving? We should be Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is our business. The child is born; immediately there is milk in the breasts of the mother. And one minute before, there is no milk. There is no milk. Just the child is born, immediately. Who supplies the milk? He does not see that <span class="Italic">eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān,</span> that one Supreme is supplying all the necessities of the others. So our duty is only to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Other things will be supplied by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> The example that if God is supplying, then why doesn't He supply the underprivileged countries? Just like in some places like India people are starving. So why doesn't He supply places like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says India is starving? You are saying. I'm Indian, I don't starve. You are false propaganda, "India's starving."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Bangladesh they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I was in Bangladesh also; they're not starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one is starving. This is all propaganda. This propaganda.... You know in your country there are so many foundations. There is so many false organizations. They're under the name of India, they draw the money and take it. I've seen it. They have got arrangement with the trustees of the fund, and with some propaganda they draw money, and then they divide, the trustees and the organization. That's all. I've seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Places like Africa, such as Biafra, where they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are countries, there is, they are not opulent or affluent as you are. But that doesn't mean they're starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they show so many places of children with malnutrition, and they say that so many thousands of people are dying every week in certain areas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got your..., so many hippies are malnutrition. You have got enough food right there-malnutrition. What is this? Another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's not actually a very good argument of theirs anyway, because here in America they were found to be dumping excess grains in the ocean, excess milk they give to the pig farms, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mismanagement. This, of course nature's way, sometimes something is produced in large quantities, sometimes less quantity. Therefore the arrangement should be where there is less quantity, the large country with production will be distributed. But they'll throw into the ocean. Still, they will not supply to the country where there is less production.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> It would seem that if money was not the means of exchange, this would not go on. Because then they would trade even excess food for other things that they required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They limit the supply so they can sell things for higher prices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, here the American policy, the Western policy, that if the people get easily food, they'll not come to work in the industry. That is their policy. If they get cheap food, then they won't work. That is human nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> That is very interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> That's very interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they want to keep them starving or in want, so they'll come and produce and make the capitalists rich. This is the system. [break] ...idea, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> It's (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in here, in Hawaii, they set fire to the huts. Poor beggars, they are living in cottages, the government set fire so that they may be without home and come to work. Do you know that? Yes? You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Hawaii?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> They seem to let people live in these buildings, boxes. They don't want to let people live on the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When the government comes they may have so many health rules and regulations that if someone has a little hut, they will not let them stay there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They set fire. They set fire. "Let them become without home, then they will work for my shop."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There were so many mangoes here that were dropping to the ground, and they've gotten rid of some of the mango trees because they said that the people were stopping on the side of the road picking up the mangoes, it was causing a traffic hazard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Causing what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They were causing traffic disturbance. So therefore they took away the mango trees. There were much more mango trees in Hawaii than there are now. Anyone could go and take mangoes off the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't want natural things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Chanting produce plain living, high thinking. The modern leaders, they don't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We're a threat to the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their policy is "High living and poor thinking." They live in skyscraper but don't care for where they are going to next life, as a cat and dog. Never mind. Now live in skyscraper. Poor thinking. High living, poor thinking (laughter). No, that "Now I am living in the skyscraper building on the twenty-fifth story, and next life I'm going to be cockroaches here." (everyone laughs) They don't know that. He doesn't inquire, "Wherefrom the cockroaches coming?" (everyone laughs) He has got attachment for this twenty-fourth story, so, but he's working so that he'll become a cockroach. So Kṛṣṇa has given chance, "All right. You live in the twenty-fourth story as cockroach." And then you'll be again killed by some.... What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Tenants. Exterminator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yea. That he does not know. Therefore poor thinking. He's thinking that "I shall perpetually live here." And when the death will come, "Get out!" (everyone laughs) "Become a cockroach." What he'll do? What he'll do? What power you have got? Nature is the same, that he'll come. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> "Now everything finished. Get out and become a cockroach." How the scientists can stop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You said that tree that stands in the back garden of the house we used to live in in Malibu, and that was the former owner of the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> ...are so dull that if you give them the proposition...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say poor thinking. High living, poor thinking. He doesn't know what he's got. They think this motorcar and twenty-fifth-story living will continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's not even a peaceful condition to live by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. Supposing it is good. But he does not think "How I shall live in this way and next time I may be cats and dogs and cockroaches. What I'm doing for them?" Therefore they will evade: "No, no. There is no next life." Because it is horrible for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Most of the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> think that if you believe in the law of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> it applies to you, but if you do not believe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Most of them think that if you believe in the law of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> it applies to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When it is law, you believe or not believe, rascal, it will be effective, if it is a law. You believe, I don't believe, if I commit theft I'll not be punished. So what is your belief? As soon as you commit theft, you'll be punished. You believe or not believe. That is law. What is the value of your belief? Rascal may believe that "I'm not going to be old man. I shall remain young man." Believe or not believe, must become old man. What is the value of your belief? Trust no future. You believe or not believe, there is future. What is value of your belief? Where do you.... You have complete control? Here the law is "Keep to the right." You don't believe. Now "Why shall I keep to the right? I shall go to the left." Immediately you'll be punished. You have to believe. I'll do wrong way, see the result. Immediately there's ticket. So what is the value of your belief? The law is law. Ignorance is no excuse for law. You have committed something wrong, and in the court you're going to be punished. If you say the clerk, "Sir, I did not know that by committing this act how I shall be, I will have to be punished." That is not excuse. Your ignorance they do not believe; you must go. That is the law. It is called foolishness. "They believe," "I think," "It may be." This is science. This is their proposition: "It may be," "I think," "I believe." What is the value of this? And everywhere you'll find all these philosophers, scientists, and they'll talk like this, nonsense: "I believe," "It may be." Believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa. But he believes himself. You see? Kṛṣṇa says it is this. That he doesn't believe. But he has become more than Kṛṣṇa, he'll believe something is correct. This is his foolishness. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> You believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa, who is worshiped by everyone. Hm? But you won't. You believe in your conviction, "I believe." So what you are? First consider in comparison to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still he believes his own conviction. Don't believe Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> Everyone feels he's the center of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he's not. That is his another foolishness. Even in this state, I am not center. I cannot do whatever I like. I have to believe the law. There is law, and it's sanity. And if he says, "I am the center. I am the monarch of all I survey," (everyone laughs) that is foolishness. He believes in his foolishness, that's all. If I claim, "I am the monarch of Hawaii," is that belief correct? "I am the center of everything. I am moving this." And this rascal's meditation is like this: "I am moving the sun. I am moving the moon." The meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I once had a boy tell me on the street, he said, he said, "Yes, I am the, I am the center of the universe." He said we're the center...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This belief, not nonsense belief? Mad man's belief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> People say, "Oh it's my life. This is my life, my..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...people in general, they're all rascals. Don't think lot of people are one. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When someone moves to another country, then it's very natural that they go and find out from their authorities what the laws of the country are. Yet when they're here, they don't bother to find out what the natural laws are and how to act as a human being. They just disregard it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...think he must know how things are going on. That is knowledge. "I have created heaven. I am the center. Whatever I believe, that's all right." There's so many rascal philosophers. Everyone is thinking "I am the..." And their different views.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they're mentally satisfied, they think that's the ultimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...there's no such thing. "I believe." Immediately.... What Kṛṣṇa says, that's true. That is our movement. Kṛṣṇa consciousness. What I believe? I'm a nonsense. I am.... I have got four defects in my life: illusion, mistake, cheating, insufficiency. What is the meaning of my belief? A cheater saying, "I believe," I have to accept if I know that he's a cheat? [break] ...the public, by misleading them they have gone to moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (tape static-inaudible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (inaudible) ...some tickets for going to moon. What they are doing with the tickets? You know that Pan American sold tickets for going to moon? You do not know? (laughs) They sold tickets, because in your country, you have got lot of money, any kind of cheating can draw money. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (6):</span> They're selling tickets to go to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not now. They sold in the beginning. They're so hopeful now that "We shall go to the moon." Some family (inaudible) "Oh, scientific advancement. Yes, they go to the moon. So I have got money. Why not purchase a ticket so I can go to the moon?"
