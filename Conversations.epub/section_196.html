<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...1972 in Māyāpura. Conversations between Śrīla Prabhupāda and Bob, a Peace Corps worker, entitled "Perfect Questions, Perfect Answers." [break] (Devotees are singing prayers to Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva loudly over loudspeaker in background.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...because he knows things as they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob Cohen:</span> (indistinct) ...knows things as they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> He hopes he knows things as they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's supposed to know. We approach to a scientist because he's supposed to know the things right. (A loudspeaker is playing very loudly in the background.) Let them make a little soft. [break] (laughter) Great relief. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have felt that the loudspeakers were too loud all day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And I mentioned it to somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is pinching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah. It loses some maybe transcendentalism through the amplifier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Ask them to make it softer. So scientist means one who knows things as they are. That is scientist. So Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break] So just like your daughter, she was also... I was little older, so I was beating her like anything. (laughter) (pause) So Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> All-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> All-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So unless God becomes all-attractive, how He can become God? (pause) A man is important when he's attractive. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, God must be attractive and attractive for all. Therefore, if God has got any name, or if you want to give any name to God, only "Kṛṣṇa" can be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But why only the name Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because all-attractive. Kṛṣṇa, this word, means all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God has no name, but by His quality we give His name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> May He be called...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if a man is very beautiful, we call "beautiful." If a man is very intelligent, we call him "wise." So name is given according to the quality. Because God is all-attractive, therefore the only name Kṛṣṇa can be applied to Him. Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What about a name meaning "all-powerful"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Attractive means... Unless you are powerful, how you can be attractive? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It includes everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Includes everything. He must be very beautiful, He must be very wise, He must be very powerful, He must be very famous...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is Kṛṣṇa attractive to rascals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. He was the greatest rascal also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> How is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Because he was teasing always the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Teasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The Rādhārāṇī would go, because She was married and Kṛṣṇa will attack Her. And when She fall down, "Kṛṣṇa, don't torture Me in that way," She will fall down, and Kṛṣṇa will take the opportunity and kiss her. (Prabhupāda laughs) So from superficially, Rādhārāṇī was very pleased, but superficially Kṛṣṇa is a great, the greatest rascal. Unless rascaldom is not in Kṛṣṇa, how rascaldom is there, existence in the world? Because our formula of God is that He's the source of everything. Ask her not to talk. (Shouts at someone in Bengali) <span class="Italic">Katha kaibe nā! Katha kaibe nā.</span> Unless rascaldom is not in Kṛṣṇa, how it can be manifest. Because He's the source of everything. But His rascaldom is so nice that everyone worships His rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But what about the rascals who are not so nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, rascaldom is not nice. But Kṛṣṇa is absolute God, therefore rascaldom is also good. Kṛṣṇa is all-good. God is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, when He becomes a rascal, that is also good. That is Kṛṣṇa. Rascaldom is not good, but when it is practiced by Kṛṣṇa, because He's absolute good, that rascaldom is also good. That one has to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Are there some people who do not find Kṛṣṇa attractive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the..., no question of some people. Kṛṣṇa cannot be compared with some people. He's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No, do some people find Him not attractive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Do some people find Kṛṣṇa not attractive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Anyone will find Him... Some people must be of some kind. You cite any kind of people, he'll be attracted. Who's not attracted? Just place a man, example, that "This man or this living entity is not attracted to Kṛṣṇa." Just find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Somebody who wishes to do things in life that he may feel are wrong, but he wishes to do to gain power or prestige or money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...may find God unattractive. He may not find the God attractive, because God gives him guilt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not the God. Because he wants to be powerful, his attraction is to become powerful. A man wants to become powerful, or rich. Is that not? But nobody is richer than Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa is attractive to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So if a rich, if a person who wants to become rich prays to Kṛṣṇa, will he become rich?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> He can become rich through this means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Because Kṛṣṇa is all-powerful. If you pray to Kṛṣṇa to become rich, Kṛṣṇa will make you rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But even if you do not live, even if you live an evil life you will still become rich?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If somebody lives an evil life but prays to become rich, they may still become rich?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Prays to Kṛṣṇa, that is not evil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> All right, I... Oh, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckling) Somehow or other, he prays to Kṛṣṇa, so you cannot say that He's evil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah. I think, the Sanskrit I don't know, but the English maybe I do. Is it "Even if the most evil man prays to Me..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> "...then he will be elevated."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So as soon as he begins to pray to Kṛṣṇa, that is not evil. Therefore He is all-attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you cover?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I covered the outside with a cloth, I didn't want to disturb you; so I put thick cloth on the outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have covered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kaṁsa... You know Kṛṣṇa's life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Not, not much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's mother... (pause-background noise is very loud) [break] ...the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> that the Absolute Truth or the Supreme Personality of Godhead is the reservoir of all pleasure<span class="Italic">-raso vai saḥ.</span> Everyone is hankering after something because he relishes some mellow in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some mellow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Ah, some mellow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like a man is drinking. Why he's drinking? He's getting some mellow out of that drinking. A man is hankering after money because by possessing money he gets a mellow out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What does mellow mean? Maybe I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is mellow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Taste, pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, O.K.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, pleasure. Pleasing taste. So <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say, <span class="Italic">raso vai saḥ.</span> The exact Sanskrit translation of mellow is <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> Eggplant fried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! (laughter) All-attractive! All-attractive! You are becoming all-attractive!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, No more, no more! No more attraction! (laughing) Where is your all-attractive daughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mālatī:</span> She is in all-attractive <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, she's all-attractive. (chuckling) Everyone loves her. [break] <span class="Italic">...Kṛṣṇa, the Reservoir of All Pleasure.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This must be a new book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Prabhupāda said tonight again, he said, "Kṛṣṇa is the greatest scientist." And he said (indistinct) more that I remembered, but I can't recall now. There was something else he said that stuck in my mind, I just can't recall it. Can you remind me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How is Kṛṣṇa the greatest scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because He knows everything. A scientist means one who knows a subject matter thoroughly. He's scientist. Kṛṣṇa, He knows everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You said... I told you I teach science. You had said something about teaching, or teaching of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Teaching, unless you have got perfect knowledge how you can teach? That is our proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Without perfect knowledge, though, you can teach what knowledge you have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is cheating. That is not teaching, that is cheating. Just like the scientists said, "There was a chunk, and the creation took place, perhaps..." What is this? Simply cheating. It is not teaching, it is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Let me say what else you said this morning that was interesting. I asked him about miracles, and Prabhupāda said that only a fool would believe in miracles because... Let us say you are a child and an adult lifts this table. That's a miracle. Or you're a chemist, and you combine acid and base and make smoke, an explosion or whatever. To somebody ignorant, that's a miracle. And for everything there's a process. And so when you see a miracle, it's just ignorance of the process. So that only a fool would believe in miracles, and, you correct me if I say wrong...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...that when Jesus came, the people then were somewhat more ignorant and needed miracles as aid. Was that... I wasn't sure if that's quite what you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Miracle means ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I had asked this in relation to all the miracle men you hear about in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the highest miracle man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated by Kuntī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Without perfect knowledge, can I not teach some things? For example, I may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can teach up to that, which point you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But should not claim to teach more than I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> In other words, you can't teach the truth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> ...you can't teach the truth with partial knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is not possible by any human being. Because any human being, his senses are imperfect. So how he can teach perfect knowledge? Just like you see the sun like a disc. You have no means to approach the sun. If you say, "We can see the sun by telescope and this and that," that is also made by you. And you are imperfect, your instrument is imperfect. Because that telescope you can say that you are seeing, but that machine is made by you, and you are imperfect. How your machine can be perfect? Therefore your knowledge of the sun is imperfect. So you don't teach about sun unless you have got perfect. That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But what about to teach that it is supposed that the sun is 93,000,000 miles away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you say "it is supposed," it is not scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah, but I think almost all of science, then, is not scientific. Because all science... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, I see. Is based on, you know, suppositions of this or that. So imperfect knowledge may be taught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Imperfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're teaching imperfect. Just like they are advertising so much about moon. Do you think the knowledge is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What do you think is the proper duty of the teacher?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No more. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What is the proper duty of the teacher in society? Let's say a science teacher. What should he be doing in the classroom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Classroom, you should simply teach about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> He should not teach about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that will include everything. But his aim should be how to know Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Can a scientist teach the science of combining acid and alkaline and this kind of science with Kṛṣṇa as its object?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it can be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If you... When one studies science, one finds general tendencies of nature, and these general tendencies of nature point to a controlling force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining the other day. Where? In Madras, or where? "Who has supplied these chemicals?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ah, in Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I asked one chemist that according to chemical formula, hydrogen and oxygen mixed, it becomes water. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this vast water in the Atlantic Ocean and Pacific Ocean, how much chemicals were required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> How much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many tons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who supplied it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This was supplied by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody must have supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is... You can teach like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And should one bother teaching that if you combine acid and alkaline...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing, the same thing, that now we have to..., that... There are so many effervescence. So, who is performing it? Who is supplying the acid and alkaline? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So this comes from the same source as the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um hmm. Yes. Water you cannot manufacture unless you have got hydrogen and oxygen. So here is a vast... Not only this Atlantic or Pacific, there are millions of planets, and there are millions of Atlantic and Pacific oceans. So who created this water with hydrogen and oxygen, and how it was supplied? That is our question. Somebody must have supplied; otherwise how it came to existence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But should it also be taught how you make water from hydrogen and oxygen? The procedure of burning them together, should this also be taught? That if you burn hydrogen and oxygen together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is secondary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is secondary. That is not very difficult. Just like this Mālatī made <span class="Italic">purī.</span> So there is flour and there is ghee, and she made <span class="Italic">purī,</span> but unless there is ghee and flour, where is the chance of making <span class="Italic">purī?</span> (pause) In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is this, "Water, earth, air, fire, they are made of My energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Made of, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "My energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali?) What is your body. This external body, that is your energy. Do you know that? The body is made out of your own energy. Just like I am eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am creating some energy, and therefore my body is maintained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore your body is made out of your energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But when you eat the food, there is energy from the sun in the food...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that... I am giving the example, I am creating some energy by digesting the food and that is maintaining my body. Therefore my body is maintained by my energy. If your energy supply is not proper, then your body becomes not in proper order. Therefore the conclusion is that your body is made out of your own energy. Similarly, why this big gigantic body, universes, is not made of Kṛṣṇa's energies? How can you deny? As your body is made out of your energy, similarly, the universal body must be made by somebody's energy. That is Kṛṣṇa. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have to think about that. I have to think about it to follow that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why follow? It is a fact. (Bob laughs) Your hairs are growing daily. Why? Because you have got some energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The energy I obtain from my food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somehow or other, you have obtained that energy. And through that energy your hairs are growing. So if your body is manufactured by your energy, similarly, the whole gigantic manifestation is made of God's energy. It is a fact it is not your energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah. O.K. I see that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Just like, aren't the planets in this universe the sun's energy, a product of the sun's energy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But who produced the sun? That is Kṛṣṇa's energy. Because it is heat, and Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">. Analaḥ, analaḥ,</span> heating. "That is My energy." The sun is representation of the heating energy of Kṛṣṇa. It is not your energy. You cannot say that "The sun is made by me." But somebody must have made. And Kṛṣṇa says. So we believe therefore Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we are Kṛṣṇa-ites.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Kṛṣṇites.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our knowledge is perfect. You cannot say... If I say that "Heat is energy of Kṛṣṇa," you cannot defy it. Because it is not your energy. Just like in your body there is some certain extent of heat. Similarly... Heat is somebody's body's energy. And who is that body? That is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, it is My energy." So my knowledge is perfect. Therefore I am the greatest scientist. Because I take the version of the greatest scientist, therefore I am greatest scientist. I may be fool personally, but because I take the knowledge from the greatest scientist, I am greatest scientist. I have no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no difficulty to become the greatest scientist. Because I take the knowledge from the greatest scientist. (pause) [break] "This earth, water, fire, air, ether, mind, intelligence and ego-they are My eight separated energies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> They're separate energies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Separated. Separate, no? Just like this milk. What is this milk? The separated energy of the cow. Is it not? It is the manifestation of the separated energy of cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Is it like a by-product?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So what is the significance of this energy being separated from Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Separated means this is made out of the body of the cow, but is is not cow. That is separation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So this earth and all is made out of Kṛṣṇa, but is not Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not Kṛṣṇa. Or you can say, Kṛṣṇa and not Kṛṣṇa simultaneously. That is our philosophy. One and different. You cannot say different because these things without Kṛṣṇa has no existence. At the same time you cannot say, "Then let me worship water. Why Kṛṣṇa?" That the pantheists, they say, that "Because everything is God, so whatever I take, that is God worship." The Rama-Krishna Mission says like that. But that's wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The Rama-Krishna Mission says that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the Māyāvādīs. "Because everything is made of God, therefore everything is God." That is their... But our philosophy is everything is God, but not God also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So what on earth is God? Is there anything on earth that is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because it is made out of the energy of God. (pause) But (that) does not mean that anything you worship, you worship God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So what is on earth, though, is not <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">māyā</span> means energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It means energy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> another meaning: illusion. So foolish persons, the energy is accepted as the energetic. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like sunshine. Sunshine enters your room. Sunshine is the energy of the sun. But because the sunshine has entered in your room you cannot say the sun has entered. If sun enters, then your room and yourself, everything will be finished immediately. (laughter) You'll not have the leisure to understand that sun has entered. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot say that sunshine is not sun. But without sun, where is the sunshine? So you cannot say sunshine is not sun. But at the same time it is not sun. It is sun and not sun, both. That is our philosophy. <span class="Italic">Acintya-bhedābheda,</span> inconceivable. In the material science you cannot conceive that a thing simultaneously positive and negative. That you cannot think. That is inconceivable energy. And because everything is Kṛṣṇa's energy, Kṛṣṇa can manifest Himself from any energy, and act. Therefore, when we worship Kṛṣṇa made of something of earth, water, or something like that, that is Kṛṣṇa, that is not Kṛṣṇ... You cannot say it is not Kṛṣṇa. When you worship this metal form of Kṛṣṇa, that is Kṛṣṇa. That's a fact. Because metal is energy of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is non-different from Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa's so powerful that He can present Himself fully in His energy. So this Deity worship is not heathenism. It is actually worshiping God, provided you know the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If you know the process, then the Deity becomes Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not becomes, it (is) Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The Deity is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But only if you know the process of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like this electric wire is Kṛṣṇa..., er, is electricity. One who knows the process he can derive electricity out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Otherwise it's just wire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So if I build a statue of Kṛṣṇa, it is not Kṛṣṇa. But if I, unless I know the process...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is Kṛṣṇa. But you have to know the process that it is Kṛṣṇa. It is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is not just earth and mud, it is Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, earth... Earth has no separate existence without Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "It's my energy." You cannot separate the energy and the energetic. It is not possible. You cannot separate heat from fire. But fire is different from the heat. And heat is different from the fire. You are taking heat, that does not mean you are touching fire. Fire, in spite of expanding heat, it keeps its identity. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa by His different energies creating everything, He remains Kṛṣṇa. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they think, "If Kṛṣṇa is everything, then Kṛṣṇa's separate identity is not there." That is material thinking. Just like drinking this milk, so little, little, when I finish, there is no more milk. It has gone to my belly. Kṛṣṇa is not like that. Because He's omnipotent, we are utilizing His energy continually, but still He's there, present. Just like a man begetting children unlimitedly, but the man is there. Crude example. But not that because he has produced hundreds of children, therefore he is finished. So similarly, God or Kṛṣṇa, in spite of His unlimited number of children, He's there. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇasya pūrṇam ādāya pūrṇam eva avaśiṣyate [Iso</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is never finished. [break] ...so powerful, therefore He is attractive. This is one side of the display of Kṛṣṇa's energies. Similarly, He has got unlimited energies. This study of Kṛṣṇa's energy is only one side, one portion only. So in this way if you go on studying Kṛṣṇa, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not a bogus thing, that "maybe," "perhaps not." Absolutely. It is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> And the study itself is never finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How can you? Kṛṣṇa has unlimited energy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I've asked devotees about how they feel towards sex in their relations, and I under..., I see their way they feel, but I can't see myself acting the same way. See, I'll be getting married in this end of this summer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I'll be getting married the end of this summer, in September or August, when I return to America. And the devotees say that the householders only have sex to conceive a child. And I cannot picture myself at all in such a position, and... What kind of sex life can one lead, living in the material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Vedic principle is that one should avoid sex life altogether. The whole Vedic principle is to get liberation from this material bondage. And there are different attachments for this material enjoyment, out of which sex life is the source of topmost enjoyment. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says that this material world... <span class="Italic">Puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etam [SB </span>5.5.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Means that a man is attached to woman and woman is attached to man. Not only human society, in animal society also. That attachment is the basic principle of material life. So, a woman is hankering or seeking after the association of a man, and a man is hankering or seeking the association of a woman. Just like we see the, all the fictions, novels, dramas, this cinema, or even ordinary advertisement, simply they depict the attachment between man and woman. Even in tailor's shop you'll find on the window some woman, some man. [break] So this attachment is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The attachment between man and woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man and woman. So if you want to get liberation from this material world, then that attachment should be reduced to nil. Otherwise, simply for that attachment, you'll have to take birth and rebirth, either as human being or as demigod or as an animal, as a serpent, as a bird, as a beast. You have to take birth. So this basic principle of attachment, increasing, is not our business. It is decreasing. <span class="Italic">Pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalam.</span> This is the general tendency, but if one can reduce and stop it, that is first class. Therefore our Vedic system is that first of all a boy is trained as a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> no sex life. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī.</span> He goes to the teacher's home. (pause-a devotee chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa over loudspeaker is very loud.) Who is this? Stop it. [break] The whole principle is, Vedic principle is, to reduce it, not to increase it. Therefore the whole system is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> Our, the Indian system is called <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> four spiritual orders and four social orders. The social order is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Uh, this is spiritual order. And social order is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So under this system the regulative principles are so nice that even one has got the tendency for enjoy material life, he is so nicely molded that at last he gets liberation and goes back to home, back to Godhead. This is the process. So sex life is not required on principle, but because we are attached to that, therefore there are some regulative principles. Sex life... It is said in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that</div>
<div class="Verse">puṁsaḥ striyā mithunī-bhāvam etaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tayor mitho hṛdaya-granthim āhuḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ato gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair<br class="calibre2"/>janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">It is said that this is the basic principle of material life: attachment for man or woman. And when they are united, when a man and a woman is united, that attachment becomes increased. And that increased attachment will induce him for <span class="Italic">gṛha,</span> means home; <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> means land; <span class="Italic">suta,</span> means children; <span class="Italic">āpta,</span> friendship, or society; and <span class="Italic">vitta, vitta</span> means money. In this way, <span class="Italic">gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittaiḥ,</span> he becomes entangled. <span class="Italic">Janasya moho 'yam.</span> This is the illusion. And by this illusion he becomes <span class="Italic">ahaṁ mameti [SB </span>5.5.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I am this body, and anything in relationship with this body, that is mine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What is that again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This attachment increases. The material attachment. The material attachment means "I am this body, and because I have got this body in a particular place, that is my country." And that is going on. "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am German," "I am this," "I am that," this bodily... "This is my country. I shall sacrifice everything for my country, society." So in this way the illusion becomes increased. So under this illusion, when he dies he gets another body. That may be a superior body or inferior body according to his <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So if he gets superior body, then that is also entanglement. Even if he goes to the heavenly planet, that is entanglement. And if he becomes cats and dogs, then his life's lost. A tree. There is every chance. So this science is not known in the world, that how the soul is transmigrating from one body to another and how he's being entrapped in different types of body. This science is unknown. Therefore when Arjuna was speaking from the bodily concept of life that "If I kill my brother, if I kill my grandfather, the other side..." So he was simply thinking on the basis of bodily concept of life. But when it was not solved he surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, accepted Him as spiritual master. And when Kṛṣṇa became his spiritual master He chastised him in the beginning. <span class="Italic">Aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase [</span>Bg. 2.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> that "You are talking like learned man, but you are a fool number one because you are talking on the bodily concept of life." So this sex life increases the bodily concept of life. Therefore the whole process is to reduce it to nil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> To reduce it over the stages of your life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Reduce it, just like a boy is trained up as a student up to twenty-five years, restricting sex life. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī.</span> So, some of the boys they remain <span class="Italic">naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī.</span> He, because he's given education, so if he becomes fully conversant he doesn't like to marry. But one who has not such restraint, he's allowed to marry. That is also restricted, that he cannot have sex life without being married. Therefore in the human society there is marriage, not in the animal society. But we are reducing human society gradually to animal society. We are forgetting marriage. That is also written in the <span class="Italic">śāstras. Svīkāra eva codvāhe.</span> In the Kali-yuga there will be no marriage performances, but the boy and the girl, they'll simply agree to live together. <span class="Italic">Dāmpatye 'bhirucir hetuḥ.</span> And their relationship will exist on sexual power. If the man or the woman is deficient in sex life, then there is divorce. So on this philosophy... There are many western philosophers like Freud and others. They have written so many books. But according to Vedic culture, we are not interested. We are interested only for begetting children. That's all. Not to study the psychology of sex life. There is already psychology, <span class="Italic">pravṛtti,</span> natural. Even if one does not read any philosophy, he'll be sexually inclined. There is no need of philosophizing sex life. Nobody is taught sex life in the school and the colleges, but everyone knows it, how to do it. (laughs) So <span class="Italic">pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalam.</span> That is the general tendency. But education should be given to stop it. That is real education. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That, for today, is a radical concept, for nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Presently, in America that's a radical concept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, in America there are so many things which requires thorough reformation. And this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that. When I went to your country, so I saw these boys and girls, they're living like friends. I said that "You cannot live as friends; you must get yourself married."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Many people see that even marriage is not sacred. So they find no desire to... Because people get married, and if things are not proper they get divorced so very easy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...that some people feel to get married is not meaningful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the idea is that marriage is not sacred. They think marriage is a legalized prostitution. They think like that, but marriage is not that. Even that Christian paper, what is that, "Watch...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Christian..."Watchtower?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Watchtower." It has criticized, one priest has allowed the marriage between man to man, homosex. So these things are going on. They take it purely for prostitution. That's all. So therefore people are thinking, "What is the use of keeping a regular prostitution at a cost of heavy expenditure? Better not to have this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You use that example of the cow and the market?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when the milk is available in the market, what is the use of keeping a cow? (laughter) It is a very abominable condition. In the western countries I have seen. Here also, in India, gradually it is coming to be so. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break] ...movement is especially meant for making human life, reaching the real goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The real goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real goal of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is the real goal of life to know God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So that is the real goal, to know God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Go back to home, back to Godhead. That is real goal of life. Just like the water coming from the sea as cloud falls down as rain and the actual goal is to flow down the river and again go to the sea. So we have come from God. Now we are embarrassed in this material life. Therefore the aim should be how to get out of this embarrassment and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is real goal of life.</div>

So <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam...</span> Kṛṣṇa says, God says, that this place is <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam,</span> it is a place of miseries. And that also <span class="Italic">aśāśvatam.</span> You cannot make a compromise, "All right, let it be miserable. I shall remain as American or Indian." No. That you also cannot do. You cannot remain as American. You may think that you are born in America, you are very happy. But you cannot remain as American for long. You'll have to be kicked out of the place, and next life you do not know.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But when you have some knowledge of God, then life is not so miserable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some knowledge will not do. You must have perfect knowledge. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. Tattvataḥ</span> means perfect. That perfect knowledge is being taught in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So, we are giving chance to the human society to learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is and make his life perfect. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. What your science says about the transmigration of the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I think that science cannot deny it, by scientific methods cannot deny it, or does scientific method show it. Science does not know of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say, imperfect science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Science may, though, say something. It is said in science that energy is never destroyed. It is just changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but how the energy is working in future, that science does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How the energy is diverted, how by different manipulation the energy is working differently. Just like electric energy, by different handling it is creating heater and it is creating cooler. Just opposite. But the same electric energy. So similarly, these energies, living energy, how it is being directed, which way it is going, how it is fructifying in the next life, so they do not know. They do not know. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is very simplified. <span class="Italic">Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are covered by this dress, by this shirt. When this shirt is not workable you change it. Similarly, this body is just like shirt and coat, when it is no longer workable, we have to change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What is the "we" that has to change? What is constant between one life to the next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is soul. That is soul, "I", what you are speaking, "you", what I am speaking, identification, <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> or soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> My soul is different than your soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are individual soul, I am individual soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But you have removed yourself from karmic influences. If I was to remove myself from karmic influences, would our souls be the same or different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is the same. Just like you are under certain conception of life at the present moment. Just like your these countrymen. They were under certain conception of life. But by training they have taken another conception of life. So the ultimate training is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If two people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, is their soul the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is always the same.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Soul, as spirit soul, pure soul, they are all equal. Even in animal.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same. That is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda</span> philosophy. That everything is one and different simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Now, if I may ask another question on this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The soul may be, I have considered, somewhat a part of God. But my soul I do not feel, but at times I think I feel God. It's... I'm here maybe, and you may say God is here. If the soul is inside me, then should I be able to feel God inside me? Not all of God I mean, but a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Part of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah. Not to mean to say that I feel I am God, but to mean to say I feel that I am God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I was asking Prabhupāda the meaning of the soul being part of God but I don't feel my soul, God in me. But God may be here, separate, separate from me. But should I be able to feel God inside me because my soul is a part of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, God is inside also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If I could feel God inside me, then I should be able to understand transmigration, I would think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> If I could feel God inside me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...feel this soul, then I should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is everywhere. God is inside and outside also. That is to be known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And how do you feel God inside you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, of course, not in the beginning. But you have to know it from the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> by the Vedic information, as in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> God is there in everyone's heart. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is also said, <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayā...</span> Not only in my heart, God is also within the atom. So this is the first information. And then, by yogic process you have to realize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yogic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Paramātmā</span> realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa such a yogic process for realizing this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is also yoga, yogic process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What kind of yogic process must I do to find out, to feel this information, to feel the soul inside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are many different yogic processes, but for this age this process is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Through this I can feel not only God outside, but God inside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You understand everything of God. How God is inside how God is outside, how God is working-everything will be revealed. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> By the service attitude God will reveal Himself. You cannot understand God by your endeavor. If God reveals. Just like when the sun is out of your sight you cannot see the sun by your torchlight or any light. Any amount of scientific method, you cannot see the sun at night. But in the morning you can see the sun automatically, without any torchlight. Similarly, you have to create a situation, you have to put yourself in a situation wherein God will reveal. Not that by your method you can ask God, "Please come. I will see." No, God is not your order carrier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You must please God for Him to reveal, is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do we know when God is pleased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do we know when God is pleased, when we are pleasing God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you see Him. (pause) Then you'll understand. Just like when you eat you needn't require to ask anybody whether you are feeling strength or your hunger is satisfied. If you eat, you understand that you are satisfied, you are feeling strength, you're feeling energy. It doesn't require to inquire anyone. Similarly, if actually, if you serve God, then you'll understand that "God is dictating me. God is, I am seeing God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Or God's representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Or God's representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Becomes easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore you have to go through the God's representative. <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> If you please God's representative, then automatically God becomes pleased. That is a... That you can directly see. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> How to please God's representative?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to carry out his order. That's all. God's representative is guru. So he's asking you to do this, to do that. If you do that, that is pleasing. <span class="Italic">Yasyāprasādān na gatiḥ kuto 'pi.</span> If you displease him, then you are nowhere. Therefore we worship guru. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ **.</span> A guru should be accepted as God. That is the injunction of all <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The guru should be accepted as representative of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, guru is representative. Guru is the external manifestation of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But different than, like the incarnations of Kṛṣṇa that come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> In what way is the external manifestation of the guru different than the external manifestation of, let us say, Kṛṣṇa or Caitanya when They come to earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru is one, representative of Kṛṣṇa. So there are symptoms who is guru. The general symptoms are described in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ gurum evābhigacchet, śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> The first symptom is <span class="Italic">śrotriyam.</span> Guru is in disciplic succession. One who has thoroughly heard about the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> through his spiritual master. This is general description.

<div class="Verse">tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta<br class="calibre2"/>jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam<br class="calibre2"/>śabde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>11.3.21]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Generally, the guru's symptom is that he's a perfect devotee. That's all. And he's serving Kṛṣṇa by preaching His message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Lord Caitanya, He was not a guru, He was different than guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Lord Caitanya, He was a different type of guru than you were?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Guru cannot be different types. All gurus are of one type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But He was, was He also an incarnation at the same...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself, but He is representing as guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa, as God, He demanded that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> But people misunderstood Him. Therefore Kṛṣṇa again came as guru and taught people how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Doesn't He say in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> "I am the spiritual master"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Doesn't Kṛṣṇa say "I am the spiritual master"? In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's the original spiritual master. Because He has accepted spiritual master of Arjuna. So what is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am your disciple." So unless He's spiritual master, how Arjuna becomes His disciple? He's the original guru. <span class="Italic">Tene brahma hṛdā ādi-kavaye,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> That He gave instruction about <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> in the heart of Brahmā. So He's guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, He's the original guru. Then His disciple Brahmā is guru. Then his disciple Nārada is guru. Then his disciple Vyāsa is guru. In this way there is <span class="Italic">guru-paramparā. Evaṁ paramparā prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">,</span> the transcendental knowledge is received through the disciplic succession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So a guru receives his knowledge through the succession, not directly from Kṛṣṇa. Do you receive some knowledge directly from Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa's direct instruction is there, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I see, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have to learn it through the disciplic succession; otherwise you'll misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But presently you do not receive information directly from Kṛṣṇa. It comes through the succession from the books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no difference. Suppose if I say that this is a pencil. And if you say to him, "This is a pencil." And he says to another man, "This is a pencil." Then what is the difference between his instruction and my instruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Kṛṣṇa's mercy allows you to know this now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa's mercy you can take also, provided it is delivered as it is. Now, just like we are instructing people <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now we are saying that "You give up everything, just surrender to Kṛṣṇa." So therefore there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's instruction and our instruction. There is no deviation. So if you receive knowledge in that perfect way, then it is as god as receiving the instruction directly from Kṛṣṇa. But you don't change anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> When I pray faithfully and reverently, does Kṛṣṇa hear me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Directly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> From me to Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because He's within your heart, He's always hearing you. When you are praying or not praying, you are doing some nonsense, He also hearing. And when you pray, that is very good, welcome. But even if you are doing some nonsense, He's hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is praying louder than nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> To Kṛṣṇa's ear, is praying louder than nonsense talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, He's all-perfect. He can hear any temper, or any degree of saying. Even if you don't speak, even if you simply think, He can hear you. As soon as you think that "I shall do it," then He hears you. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But one should pray, is that so? That one should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Listening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Praying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Whose business? You mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every living entity's. That is the only business. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That is the statement of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What does that mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He supplies everything. Everyone, actually He's supplying. He's supplying food to everyone. So He's father. So why should you not pray, "Father, give me this"? Just like in Christian Bible there is, "Father, give us our daily bread." That is good, they are accepting the Supreme Father. But grown-up children, they should not ask from the father, but they should be prepared to serve the father. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> My questions you solve so nicely. (Mild laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So, should I ask you another question now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have read that we are influenced by the different <span class="Italic">guṇas,</span> passion, ignorance, ...[break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Speaks to someone is Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I've read about there are three <span class="Italic">guṇas,</span> passion, ignorance, and goodness, in life. And I was wishing that you could explain this somewhat, especially what is meant by the mode of ignorance and the mode of goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Goodness means you can understand things. Knowledge. You can know that there is God, that this world is created by Him, and so on, so on, so many things, actual things. The sun is this, the moon is this, perfect knowledge. Even not perfect, he has got some knowledge. That is goodness. And passion means he identifies with this material body. And he tries to gratify his senses only. That is passion. And ignorance means animal life. He does not know what is God, how to become happy, "why I am in this world." Just like you are taking one animal to the slaughterhouse, it will go. But a man will protest. So this is ignorance. The goat, it is to be killed after five minutes, but if you give him a morsel of grass he's happy, he's eating. Just like a child. You are planning to kill her or kill him, he is happy, he's laughing, because innocent. That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This is... Being in these modes determines your <span class="Italic">karma,</span> is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Determines your <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to the association of the modes of nature your activities are being contaminated. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> A man gets higher birth or lower birth according to the association of the <span class="Italic">guṇa,</span> or the modes of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So cheating and like that, what mode is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheating is mixed up passion and ignorance. Just like one man cheats other. That means he wants to obtain something. He's passionate. But he commits some murder. He does not know that "I'll have to suffer for it." So it is a mixture of passion and ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And what about when somebody helps another person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Why is that goodness? What intelligence is that? I mean, is,... This represents knowledge of what? You said that goodness is when you have knowledge, intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So helping another person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's ignorant, you're trying to enlighten him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So giving intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What about just giving assistance, like you give...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> To a beggar who has nothing you give alms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um hmm. So that is goodness. But still... Just like in your Bowery Street, they give some charity, and immediately he purchases one bottle of wine and drinks and lie down flat. (laughter) So that is charity... That is not goodness, that is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That charity is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are three kinds of charities: goodness, passion, and ignorance. Goodness means charity where charity <span class="Italic">must</span> be given. Just like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So if anyone gives charity to this movement, that is goodness. Because it is spreading God consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is goodness. And if one gives charity for some return, that is passion. And if somebody gives in charity, he does not know what he's going to do, just like the Bowery man, that is ignorance. So our Vedic principle is, Kṛṣṇa says, that <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi dadāsi yat kuruṣva mad-arpaṇam.</span> That "Give Me." There is no question of knowing what is going to happen. If Kṛṣṇa takes, that is the perfection of charity. Or anyone who is representative of Kṛṣṇa, he takes, that is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And what kind of charity is it when you give to, food to somebody who is hungry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is also depends on goodness and passion and ignorance. That example I was giving, that a doctor has forbidden that "This patient should not take any solid food." But if you make charity, "Oh, he..." And he's asking "Give me some solid..." Sometime patient asks. And if you give him solid food, then you are not doing good to him. That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Are the devotees beyond accumulating <span class="Italic">karma?</span> Have they... Does a devotee, these devotees, do they feel <span class="Italic">karma?</span> Do they work in these modes? Are they in the mode of goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Are the devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are above goodness. <span class="Italic">Śuddha-sattva.</span> Devotees are not in this material world. They're in the spiritual world. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Devotees are neither in the goodness, passion, or ignorance. They are transcendental to all these qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This is a devotee who practices very faithful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> A devotee who is very faithful reaches this stage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotee, you can become devotee, as they have become. It is not difficult. Simply you have to engage yourself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I wish to gain more knowledge of God and be able to feel God's presence more. The reason for this is because I feel life has little meaning without this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you miss this human form of life, then it is a great loss. This is a chance given to the living entity to get out of the entanglement of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> As I feel now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...thankful that I've been able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can learn more and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Now I still have my connections in home. Marriage is... I'm engaged and all this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There are so many marriages. He is married. Marriage is no barrier. I told you, there are four different orders of social life: <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha,</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So after <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> one can marry. But that is not obligatory. He may remain <span class="Italic">naiṣṭhika-brahmacārī</span> for whole life. But a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> can marry. So after marriage there is <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> life. Means little aloof from family. Live-husband and wife-separately. That time there is no sex life. And then, when he's fully renounced, detached from the family life, he takes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Does somebody forget his wife completely then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Forgetting is not very difficult if you try to forget. That's all. Out of sight, out of mind. (laughter) Just like I have got my wife, children, my grandchildren, everything. But out of sight, out of mind. That's all. Therefore <span class="Italic">vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> Everything is nicely arranged by the Vedic system. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are feeling warm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Just tight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too tight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I was cold before. [break] (Loudspeaker in background is very loud) Thank you so much for allowing me to ask my questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is my mission, that people should understand the science of God. Because I am convinced that it's a fact. That without again cooperating with the Supreme Lord, our life is baffled. I give this example many times. Just like a screw from the machine fallen down, it has no value. The same screw, when it is again attached with the machine, it has value. Similarly, we are part and parcel of God. Without God, as part and parcel small screw, what is the value? No value. We should again come back to the position of becoming a screw. That is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I met a fellow today who came in the afternoon. Well, his reason for coming he said, you may find humorous, was to come..., he heard the hippies were in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> He heard that hippie... [break] ...I was talking to him, and then some devotees were talking to him. And he had said some things to me which I could find no answer for. And he said he'll come back tomorrow to see devotees. But let me tell you. This is confusing. When he was young...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Indian, Indian, lives nearby. He speaks English fairly well. When he was young, said he worshiped Kālī every day very vigorously. But then the floods all came, and the floods came, and the people saw hardship. But now he has no religion, and he says he finds his happiness in trying to develop love among people. And I couldn't think of what to say to him to add religion to his life, to add God to his life. He says, "After the hereafter," he says, after he dies, "so maybe I'll become part of God, maybe not," he says, but he can't worry about it now. He says he's tried this religious experience; it didn't work. And one reason I ask this is when I go back to America a lot of people I come across are like this. They see that religion, like his worship of Kālī or other kinds of religion that they've experienced doesn't work. And I don't know what to say to them to convince them that it's worth trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You do not try to convince him at the present moment. You try to be convinced yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> (laughs) Yes, yes. I did... I asked him to see devotees, but then on the way out as he was leaving down the road I met him again and talked, "Come back," but... Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You first of all be convinced and then try to convince others. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction is that you can do welfare for others when your life is success.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The devotees have said to me that without consciousness of Kṛṣṇa all the time, you cannot be happy. Without consciousness of Kṛṣṇa you cannot be happy. But at times I feel happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At times, not always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you be Kṛṣṇa conscious you'll feel always happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh. (laughter) They had implied that you cannot feel happy without Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's fact. Just like if you are an animal of this land and if you are thrown into the water, you cannot be happy in the water in any condition. When you're again taken up to the land, then you'll be happy. Similarly, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. We cannot be happy without being part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Now we are thrown. The same example. The machine part and parcel without the machine has no value. But when it is put again into the machine it has value. Similarly, we are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa; we must join Kṛṣṇa. So you can join immediately with Kṛṣṇa by your consciousness. Simply thinking that "I am Kṛṣṇa's, Kṛṣṇa's mine." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Kṛṣṇa is mine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Mind, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Mine. My Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Kṛṣṇa is mine, Kṛṣṇa is mine, and I am Kṛṣṇa's." That is our actual position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> We are part of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. Because everything is generated by the energy of Kṛṣṇa. And everything is energy of Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...tomorrow fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Tomorrow's fasting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Tomorrow we fast. Up until evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Until the moon comes. Then we take <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> or feast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can feast. Feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So we'll fast up until the rising of the moon and then take feast, full <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes it happens that one day out of the week all the shops close except for one. I've experienced in India that all the... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...the people coming and jumping on each other trying to get, afraid that the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> would finish before they got served.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, assure them that we can... "Don't be jumping. We shall supply you." What can be done? [break] ...the place where we shall perform sacrifice, fire sacrifice, the tablet should be taken there and we shall worship. And then we place it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll carry the tablet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To the sacrifice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall place the in... what is called, paraphernalia? And then begin. So ten feet deep and six feet wide. So you have ordered for bricks and cement? (loudspeaker in background very loud)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was speaking with Mr. Sanyal and he also agreed that by having a man come here and make the bricks, we can save fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So try to find out. [break] You can talk. [break] (A devotee is speaking in Bengali over the loudspeaker and Prabhupāda mimics him, everyone laughs.) Mahāṁsa? Who is speaking, Mahāṁsa speaking or Bardon? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I have one question. What is the purpose of service minus devotion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? That is not service; that is business. (laughter) Just like we have employed some contractor. That is not service; that is business. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like sometimes they advertise: "Our customers are our master." Is it not? Sometimes advertise. So this is business, but it is a flowery language only that "Our customers are our masters." Because nobody is a qualified customer unless he pays. Hmm? But service is not like that. Service, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">āśliṣya vā pāda-ratāṁ pinaṣṭu mām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Antya</i> 20.47]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Oh, You do whatever You like; still, You are my worshipable Lord." That is service. "I don't ask any return from You." That is service. When you expect some return that is business. (pause) Very nice road. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I wish to ask you to advise me on how I can come to feel closer to God. I'll be leaving you soon, and I'm... With you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to purify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Somewhat, but let me say I come to the temple at times and then I leave, and I'm not sure how much I take with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will not take much time. Within six months you'll realize. But you have to follow the regulative principles. Then it will be auspicious. Just like these boys and girls are doing. Just see the girl, how she's chanting always. All our girls is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah, I've seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no tendency for going to cinema or going to hotel, no. Everything all stopped. <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛttiḥ. Anartha</span> means unnecessary things, all rubbish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I feel that when I go back, though...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole human life is meant for purifying. <span class="Italic">Śuddhyed sattva. Sattva</span> means existence. So if you don't purify your existence, then you'll have to change your body, from this body to that. Sometimes it may be higher, sometimes lower. Just like, if you don't cure your disease, it can take turn in so many ways to put you into trouble. Similarly, if you don't purify your existence, then you'll have to transmigrate from one body to another. And there is no guarantee what kind of body you'll get. Very subtle laws of nature. Now there is no guarantee that you will get a very comfortable body or American body, no. Therefore for human being it is essential that he should purify his existence. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena sattvaṁ śuddhyed yasmād brahma-saukhyaṁ tv anantam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless you purify your existence, you're hankering after happiness, you cannot get continued happiness. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> When I go, I go back to my job in New York, I hope I'll become purer, but I'm sure that I won't become as pure as your devotees here. I don't see myself doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do as they are doing. They were not pure in the beginning. Now they are pure. Similarly, you can become pure. Just like in your childhood age you were not educated; now you are educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So what are the things that I may do? See, if when I go back I must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you go back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I'll be going back to Chaibasa, Behar, and to my work there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is there in Chaibasa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That's where I do my teaching. I live there with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So better do not teach. Because you do not know what to teach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have, I'm actually, I'll be going... I don't like this so much and I'll be returning to America in May. But while I'm here, this is my agreement to stay in India, that I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Referring to microphone) It will not stay. No, if you are serious, you can keep yourself pure anywhere. It doesn't matter whether you stay in America or India. But you must know how to keep yourself purified. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You mean by following these principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like I went to America. So either in America or in India, I am the same man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have tried somewhat to follow since I met you the first time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But follow... You must strictly follow if you are serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Maybe... O.K., maybe what I say now is the most foolish of all I've said, but let me tell you how I feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not foolish. I don't say foolish. But imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> O.K., imperfect. But let me tell you. I feel that right now I admire and respect your devotees, but I don't feel as if I'm part of them or even a great desire to be part of them. I feel that I just want to do what is right and come closer to God, and if I just go to a better life next time, I'd be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Maybe that's just material clinging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So just you follow in their footsteps, my other students, and it will be fulfilled, your desire. We are training to that direction, how to become purified and happy. That is our mission. We want to see everyone happy. <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhino bhavantu.</span> But people do not know how to become happy. They do not take the standard path to become happy. They manufacture their own way. That is the difficulty. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattva yasmād brahma-saukhyam anantam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This advice was given by Ṛṣabhadeva to his sons. "My dear boys, just undergo austerity," <span class="Italic">divyam,</span> "for transcendental realization." Everyone is going austerity. This boy, I know, he had to go foreign countries to learn this commercial management. So many... So now he's good situated. But everyone has to undergo some austerity for future life. So why not take that austerity for permanent happiness? <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena satt...</span> Permanent happiness, you have to purify your existential body. This body, so long you will accept this material body, you'll have to change it. And as soon as you get a spiritual body there is no question of change. Spiritual body you have already. Simply now, due to our material contamination, we are developing material body. But if we associate with spiritual life, then we shall develop spiritual body. The same example I have several times given, that you put the iron rod with fire, it will develop to be fire. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Put the iron rod into fire...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and it will become fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although iron rod.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, this body, if you always keep yourself spiritually engaged, it will act as spiritual, although it is material body. The same example. Iron rod, when it is red hot, it is not longer iron rod, although it is iron rod. You can catch it as iron rod, but touch anywhere it will burn. It has got the quality of fire. Similarly, if you always keep yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness then you become spiritualized. You'll act spiritually. No more material demands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> How do I do this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This process, as they are doing. You have seen. These boys are, our six boys, they are now initiated today. It is very simple. You have to follow the four restrictive regulations and chant this beads. Very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Well, um, but... See, when I'm back in Bihar and following my lifestyle there, I..., if I follow all these regulative principles... Some I follow now, but not all... But if I follow all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are only four regulative principles. Some means three, or two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Two or three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not other one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No, no, I mean I follow one or two now. One or two now I follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Why not the other three? What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Umm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Which one I follow? I am almost vegetarian, but I eat eggs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also not fully. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No, not even fully. But since last time I've become vegetarian, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, vegetarian is no qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Not much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see, vegetarian, the pigeon is vegetarian. The monkey is vegetarian. But most rubbish creature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A monkey is vegetarian, naked <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> lives in the forest, the most mischievous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I felt that it was a little bit of progress because it was somewhat difficult at first, then easy, and I had returned to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can stick to all regulative principles provided you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness process. Otherwise it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah, but this is it. I have... When I'm back in Bihar and my friends may say... Well, we're sitting in the evening, and there's nothing to do but fight mosquitoes, and they'll say, "How about smoking some marijuana?" And I say, "Sure, there's nothing else to do," and then I sit down and I enjoy myself for the evening. Now, we did this... we got carried away, we were doing it every day and realized we were hurting ourselves and stopped, but still, on occasion we do that....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to live with us. Then your friends will not ask you, "What about marijuana?" (Bob laughs) Keep the association of devotees. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-ras...</span> [SB 3.25.25]. We are opening centers to give chance people to associate with us. Why we have taken so much land? Providing for those who are seriously desirous. They will come and live with us. Association is very influential. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgāt. Saṅgāt sañjāyate kāmaḥ.</span> If you associate with drunkards, you become a drunkard. If you associate with <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> then you become <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He can come and stay with you in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He could come and stay in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can stay with us in Bombay. But here he wants friend, marijuana. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Um, let me ask you about something else. Then maybe I'll come back to this because I'm still... I find that I think of myself too much, and this way you can't think of God so much. One can't think of God. I think of myself in too many places. How can I forget about myself so I can concentrate on other more important things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> (laughs) You are saying to me that my path... I think what you're saying is my path to purity is to become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you hesitate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Well, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult to become a devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> For myself... It is... I don't feel so much the desire. I have... First the devotees tell me that they have given up material life. These four regulative principles, they have explained to me, means giving up material life, and that I see. And in place of this they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by material life? I am sitting on this bed. Is it material or spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how we give up material life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I think how I interpreted it was a desire for material gains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You're working towards material gains, not giving up all material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material life means when you desire to gratify your senses, that is material life. And when you desire to serve God, that is spiritual life. That is the difference between material life and spiritual life. Now we are trying to serve our senses. Instead of serving the senses, when we serve God, that is spiritual life. What is the difference between our activities and others' activities? We are using everything: table, chair, bed, this tape recorder, typewriter. So what is the difference? The difference is that we are using everything for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This I see. The devotees have said that the sensual pleasures that they have given up are replaced with spiritual kinds of pleasures. But see, I haven't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual kinds of pleasure means when you desire to please Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritual pleasure. Just like example, a mother is more pleased by feeding her son. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Spiritual pleasure, then, is pleasing God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual pleasure means pleasure of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Pleasure of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And material pleasure means pleasure of senses. That's all. This is the difference. When you try simply to please Kṛṣṇa, that is spiritual pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I had viewed this as... My thought of pleasing God was to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, don't manufacture your ways of pleasing God. Don't manufacture. Suppose if I want to please you, then I shall ask you, "How can I serve you?" Not that I manufacture service. That is not pleasing you. Suppose if I want a glass of water. And if you manufacture that "Swamiji will be more pleased if I give him a glass of milk, hot milk," that will not please me. If you want to please me, then you should ask me, "How can I please you?" And what I order, if you do that, that will please me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And pleasing Kṛṣṇa, then, is being a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The devotee means who is always pleasing Kṛṣṇa. He has no other business. That is devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Can you tell me some more about chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa? I have for quite some time chanted, but never regularly, just a little bit here and there. I just got beads very recently. And once in a while I feel comfortable chanting, and once in a while not comfortable at all. And maybe I don't chant properly. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything has got process. You have to adopt the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> The devotees tell me of the ecstasy they feel when chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is when... More you become purified, you feel ecstasy. But this chanting process is purifying process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this afternoon we were discussing about austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> About austerities. If you don't practice voluntarily austerities, then you must involuntarily practice some austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, under the direction of spiritual master. You have no mind to follow austerities, but when you accept a spiritual master you have to carry out the order. That is austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Even if you don't want to practice austerity, you must. You are forced to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because... You have got... You have surrendered to your spiritual master. His order is final. So even if you don't like, you have to do it. To please me. Even you don't like. Nobody likes to fast, but spiritual master says, "Today is fasting," so what can be done? (laughter) This is austerity. And disciple means who has voluntarily agreed to be disciplined by the spiritual master. That is austerity. (Loudspeaker in background is very loud.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Say, like our parents or many people in the material world, completely addicted to material life. They don't want to follow any austerities, uncomfortable, but still they must. By nature they're forced to austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is forced austerity; that is not good. Voluntary austerity will help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> (indistinct) ...if you don't undergo voluntary austerity, you must be forced to undergo...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) That is the difference between man and animal. Animal cannot accept austerity. But man can accept austerity. That is the difference between. Just like there is a nice foodstuff in a confectioner's shop. So a man wants to eat it, but he sees that he has no money. So he can restrain. But an animal, cow comes, immediately he pushes his mouth in that. You can beat him with stick, it will tolerate, but it will do that. Therefore, animal cannot undergo austerity. (Someone else speaks inaudibly about volume of loudspeakers) Yes, yes, reduce. [break] Our austerity is very nice. We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance, and Kṛṣṇa sends nice foodstuff, we eat. That's all. Why your people are not agreeable to such kind of austerities? Chanting, dancing, and eating nicely? (indistinct) I see austerity, call my mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose we have this nice foodstuff this mother has brought. So those who are not following austerities, they cannot expect. But because we are following austerity, Kṛṣṇa sends us nice thing. So we are not loser. When you become Kṛṣṇized, then you'll get more comfort than at the present moment. That's a fact. I am living alone for the last twenty years, but I have no difficulty. When, before taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> I was living in Delhi, these boys were taking care of me. Yes. So I had no difficulty, although I was living alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If you don't accept a spiritual discipline, then nature forces so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī<br class="calibre2"/>mama māyā duratyayā<br class="calibre2"/>mām eva ye prapadyante<br class="calibre2"/>māyām etāṁ taranti te<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Māyā is imposing so many difficulties, but as soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, no more imposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We are so foolish that we are always thinking, "In the future I'll be happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> illusion. That is an ass. You sit down on the back of the ass and just take a morsel of grass. He'll go. The ass is thinking, "Let me go forward little, and I shall get the ass, er, grass." But it is... One feet distant it always remains. That is ass-ism. (laughter) That is not... Everyone is thinking, "Let me go a little forward, and I'll get it. [break] ...get it, be very happy." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I thank you so much for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? [break] Don't talk l-e-a-v-e. But talk l-i-v-e.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I, I, I cannot yet, but I was thinking now of returning tomorrow to my town. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I should stay tomorrow, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You tell me to, I'll stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You're a very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> O.K. Thank you. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very simple. The living entities forgetting Kṛṣṇa, they are in this material world. Kṛṣṇa means His name, His form, His abode, His pastimes, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What was that last?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like, when you speak of king, it means king's government, king's palace, king's queen, king's son, secretaries, military strength, everything. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, Kṛṣṇa being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as soon as we think of Kṛṣṇa (it) means all energies of Kṛṣṇa. That is complete by saying "Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." Rādhā represents all the energy of Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord. So when we speak of Kṛṣṇa, the living entities are also included. Because the living entities are energies, different energies of Kṛṣṇa, superior energy. So when this energy is not serving the energetic, that means material existence. The whole world is not serving Kṛṣṇa. They are serving Kṛṣṇa in a different way. they are serving Kṛṣṇa indirectly. Just like disobedient citizens, they serve the government indirectly. They have come to the prison house on account of their disobedience of the laws of the state. So in the prison house they're forced to obey the laws of the state. Similarly, all the living entities here, they're godless. Either by ignorance or by his will, he doesn't like to accept the supremacy of God. Demonic. So we are trying to bring them in their original condition. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I'd like to ask you just something I talked with devotees about, just medicine. I went to go, I walked to the river with some devotees today. I have a cold, so I said I shouldn't go in the water. Some felt I should because it is the Ganges, and some said I shouldn't because I have a cold. And we were talking, and I don't understand. Some... Devotees, do we get sick because of our bad actions in the past?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But when one is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any kind of distress we suffer, it is due to our impious activities in the past.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But when one is removed from karmic influence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...does he still get sick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Even if he gets sick, that is very temporary. Just like this fan is moving. If you disconnect with the electric power, then the fan will move for a moment. That movement is not due to the electric current. That is force. What is called physically, this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Momentum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Momentum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Momentum. But as soon as he stops, no more movement. Similarly, a devotee who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, even he's found that he's suffering from material consequences, that is temporary. Therefore a devotee does not take any material miseries as misery. He takes as Kṛṣṇa's, God's, mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But what about a perfected soul, a devotee, a pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfected soul means twenty-four hours engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is perfection. Transcendental position. Perfection means to be engaged in his original consciousness. That is perfection. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> "Anyone who comes to Me, that is the..." <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiḥ labhate param. Saṁsiddhi.</span> Perfection, complete perfection. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhi. Siddhi</span> and <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi. Siddhi</span> is perfection. That is Brahman realization. And <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span> means devotion, after Brahman realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Could you just say that last thing again please?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sam</span> means complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">siddhi</span> means perfection. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated that one who goes back to home, back to Godhead, he has attained the complete perfection. So perfection means when one realizes that he's not this body, he's spirit soul. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20].</span> That is called Brahman realization. That is perfection. And <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span> means after Brahman realization, when one is engaged in devotional service. Therefore, one who is already engaged in devotional service, it is to be understood that Brahman realization is there. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I, I, I ask you this very humbly, but do you feel diseases and sickness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Do you personally feel disease and sickness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is this a result of your past <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This is a result of your past <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So one in this material world never escapes his <span class="Italic">karma</span> completely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, escapes. No more <span class="Italic">karma.</span> For a devotee, no more <span class="Italic">karma</span> reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But you must be the best devotee, and you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. No, I don't consider I am the best devotee. I am the lowest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No! No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are the best devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> (laughter) Oh, no! But see, you say, what you say..., it always, always seems right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So then you must be the best devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the thing is that even the best devotee, when he preaches, he comes to the second-class devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What would the best devotee be doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The best devotee does not preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What does he do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He sees there is no need of preaching; everyone is devotee. (Bob laughs) Yes. He sees no more nondevotee, all devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Uttama-adhikārī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Uttama-adhikārī.</span> But while I am preaching, how can I say I am the best devotee? Just like Rādhārāṇī. She does not see anyone nondevotee. Therefore we try to approach Rādhārāṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Who is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhārāṇī, Kṛṣṇa's consort.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone approaches Rādhārāṇī, She recommends to Kṛṣṇa, "Here is the best devotee. He's better than me." And Kṛṣṇa cannot refuse. That is best devotee. But it is not to be imitated, "I have become best devotee. Therefore I have stopped." That is... Actually, that is a different stage. So even the best devotee... Without (being) best devotee, he cannot preach actually, <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> but he comes to the second stage. <span class="Italic">Īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca.</span> He has the vision of <span class="Italic">dviṣat,</span> somebody envious of God. But it is not the vision of the best devotee. Best devotee sees, "Nobody is envious to God. Everyone is better than me." Just like <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> author, Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja. He says that "I am lowest than the worm in the stool."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Who was saying this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa... The author of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja. <span class="Italic">Purīṣera kīṭa haite muñi se laghiṣṭha [</span><i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Ādi 5.205]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's not making a show, he's feeling like that, that "I am the lowest. Everyone is best, I am the lowest. Everyone is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, I am not engaged." Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Oh, I have not a pinch of devotion to Kṛṣṇa. I cry to make a show. If I would have been a devotee of Kṛṣṇa I would have died long ago. I am living; that is the proof that I do not love Kṛṣṇa." That is the vision of the best devotee. He's so much absorbed in Kṛṣṇa's love that he sees, "Everything is going on; simply I am the lowest, therefore I cannot see God." That is best devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So then a devotee must work for everybody's liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. A devotee must work under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master. Not imitate the best devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not imitate the best devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Not, what is that word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Imitate, imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">ācchā, ācchā,</span> I see. Imitate. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...you said that sometimes you feel pain, some sickness, due to the sinful activities of your devotees. Is that... Couldn't sometimes disease be that, due to that? Caused by that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see, Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Kṛṣṇa's so powerful that He can immediately take up all the sins of others and immediately make it gone. But when a living entity plays the part on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, he also takes the responsibility of these sinful activities of his devotee. So to become a guru is not an easy task. You see? He has to take all the poisons and absorb. So sometimes, because he's not Kṛṣṇa, so sometimes there is some trouble. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu forbidden that "Don't make many <span class="Italic">śiṣyas,</span> many disciples." But for preaching work we have to accept many disciples, for expanding preaching. Never mind we suffer. But that's a fact. The spiritual master has to take the responsibility of all the sinful activities of his disciples. So to make many disciple is a risky job unless he's able to assimilate all the sins. (pause) [break]... <span class="Italic">patitānāṁ pāvanebhyo.</span> He takes responsibility for all the fallen souls. That is... That idea is in Bible. Just like Jesus Christ take all the sinful reaction of all people and sacrificed his life. That is the responsibility of spiritual master. Because he's Kṛṣṇa's representative. So Kṛṣṇa takes all responsibility. Kṛṣṇa is Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">apāpa-viddham.</span> He cannot be attacked by any sinful reaction. But a living entity may be subjected sometimes, because he's small. Big fire, small fire. On a small fire if you put some big things, (chuckling) then the fire itself may be extinguished. In the big fire, whatever you put, that's all right. Finished. The big fire can consume anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So Christ's suffering was of that nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Was Christ's suffering this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained, that he took the sinful reaction of all the people, therefore he suffered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said... That is the Bible, that he has taken all the sinful reactions of the people and he sacrificed his life. But these Christian people, they have made it a law that "Christ will suffer and we shall do all nonsense." Such great fools they are. They are... "Let Jesus Christ make contract for taking all one sinful reaction, and we will go on with all nonsense." That is their religion. This... They are not in sense that "Christ is so magnanimous that he took all our sins and he has suffered... We stop all these sins!" They have not come to that sense. They have taking it very easily: "Let Lord Jesus Christ suffer, and we do all nonsense." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They should have been ashamed that "Lord Jesus Christ suffered for us. Instead of... We are continuing the sinful activities still. He asked everyone, 'Thou shall not kill,' and we are indulging in killing." And "Lord Jesus Christ will excuse us, take all the sinful reaction." This is going on. [break] ...should be very much cautious that "For my sinful actions my spiritual master will suffer. So I'll not commit a pinch of sinful action." That is the duty of the disciple. After initiation his all sinful reaction is finished. Now if he again commits sinful activities, the spiritual master has to suffer. They should be sympathetic for this, that "For my sinful activities my spiritual master will suffer." [break] ...attacked with some disease it is due to the sinful activities of the disciples. Exactly like Lord Jesus Christ was crucified on account of the sinful activities of others. [break] ...forbidden, "Don't make many disciples." But we do because we are preaching. Never mind, let us suffer; still, we shall accept. [break]... question was that when I suffer it is due to my past misdeeds? Was it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my misdeed, that I accept a disciple who is nonsense. That is my misdeed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> This happens on occasion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is sure to happen because we are accepting so many men. But it is the duty of the disciple to be cautious. That "My spiritual master saved me. I may not put him again into these sufferings." [break] When the spiritual master is in suffering, Kṛṣṇa saves him. Kṛṣṇa thinks, "Oh, he has taken so much responsibility for delivering a fallen person." So Kṛṣṇa is there. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because the spiritual master takes the risk on account of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So your suffering is not the same kind of pain that an impure person...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not due to <span class="Italic">karma.</span> The pain is there sometimes so that the disciples may know that "Due to our sinful activities my spiritual master is suffering." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...very well now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm always well. [break] ...well in this sense, even there is suffering, I know Kṛṣṇa will protect me. But this suffering is not due to my sinful activities. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But let us say, when I, in the town I live in I drink boiled water because some of the water has disease in it. Now, why should I drink boiled water? If I have been good enough not to get a disease, then I may drink any water. And if I have been not doing proper, then I shall get diseased...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So boiled water is any water also. Boiled water is included within any water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But, you see, I drink that to prevent disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long you are in the material world, what is physical laws, you cannot neglect that. Just like if you go to a jungle, there is tiger. It is known that it will attack you. Why should you voluntarily go and be attacked? It is not that a devotee should take physical risk so long he has got some physical body. It is not a challenge to the physical laws: "Oh, I have become a devotee. I challenge everything." That is foolishness. <span class="Italic">Anāsaktasya viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ. Viṣaya,</span> these physical necessities, the devotee is advised to accept the necessities of life without any attachment. Physical law is take the boiled water, but if boiled water is not available, does it mean he'll not drink water? If it is not available, you drink ordinary water. [break] We take <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.</span> But while in touring, in hotels sometimes we have to take some food in the hotel. Does it mean, "Oh, I do not take any foodstuff from the hotel, I shall starve"? If I starve, then I'll be weak, I cannot preach. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Does a devotee lose some of his individuality in that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has got full individuality, but he sacrifices individuality for pleasing Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me." So he voluntarily surrenders. Not that he has lost his individuality. He keeps his individuality fully. But because Kṛṣṇa desires that he should surrender, he never minds. He's individual. Just like Arjuna, in the beginning he was declining to fight on account of his individuality. But when he accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master, he became <span class="Italic">śiṣya.</span> Then whatever He ordered, "Yes." That doesn't mean he lost his individuality. He voluntarily accepted, "Whatever Kṛṣṇa says, I shall do it." Just as all my disciples, they have not lost their individuality, but they have surrendered their individuality. That is required. Just like if a man does not use sex, does that mean he has become impotent? If he likes he can have, thousand times sex life, but he has voluntarily avoided it. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> Sometimes we fast, that does mean we are diseased. We voluntarily fast. It does not mean that I am not hungry, I cannot eat. But we voluntarily fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Does the devotee who surrenders keep his individual ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in full.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...taste for different things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Does he keep his individual likes and dislikes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything he keeps, but he gives preference to Kṛṣṇa. Suppose I like this thing. Kṛṣṇa says, "No. You cannot use it." Then they are sacrificed. It is for Kṛṣṇa's sake. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Let us say a devotee has a liking for one food over another food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But if Kṛṣṇa does not like it, he won't take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And how does he know which food Kṛṣṇa likes him to take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> You have to know from Kṛṣṇa. When you... Just like, what kind of behavior government likes, how do you know it? From the lawbooks. Is it not? Similarly, what Kṛṣṇa likes and not likes, you get from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> You cannot manufacture the like and disliking of Kṛṣṇa. That is nonsense. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He says definitely. Positively He says, that "I like these things." So we have to offer to Kṛṣṇa what He likes, and then we take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Kṛṣṇa likes Rādhārāṇī. Therefore all the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they're trying to push Rādhārāṇī to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Nikuñja-yūno rati-keli-siddhyai yā yālibhir yuktir apekṣaṇīyā **.</span> That is expert. "Oh, Kṛṣṇa likes this <span class="Italic">gopī.</span> All right, push her." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. To satisfy the senses of Kṛṣṇa. Not satisfy my senses. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">prema,</span> love for Kṛṣṇa. "Oh, Kṛṣṇa likes this. I must give Him this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> There is, some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is offered, and then we go and eat, and different <span class="Italic">prasāda's</span> are served. And some I like, and some I find the taste not at all to my liking and do not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should not do that. The perfection is whatever is offered to Kṛṣṇa, you should accept everything. You cannot make, "I like this. I do not like this." That is perfection. So long you make such discrimination that means you have not appreciated what is <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What if there is someone... This... (Static)... likes and dislikes. Say, someone is preparing some <span class="Italic">prasādam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No dislikings, no liking. Whatever Kṛṣṇa likes, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. But say someone prepares something, like some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> for Kṛṣṇa, but he does not make it so good, and it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you have made sincerely with devotion, then Kṛṣṇa will like it. Just like Vidura. Vidura was feeding Kṛṣṇa banana. So he was so absorbed in thought he was, I mean to say, throwing away the real banana and he was giving Him the skin, and Kṛṣṇa was eating. (laughter) Because He knows that "He's giving Me in the devotion." So Kṛṣṇa can eat anything, provided there is devotion, real devotion. It does not matter whether it is materially tasteful or not. Similarly, a devotee also take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Whether it is materially tasteful or not, he should accept everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the devotion is not there. Like in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotion is not there, He does not like any food, either is tasteful or not tasteful. He does not accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In India, somebody said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No India, of India, don't talk of India. Talk of the philosophy. If there is no devotion, Kṛṣṇa does not accept anything, either in India or in your country. It is not... Kṛṣṇa's not obliged to accept anything costly because it is very tasteful. Kṛṣṇa has many tasteful dishes in Vaikuṇṭha. He's not hankering after your food. He accepts your devotion. That out of... <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā, tad aham aśnāmi. Bhaktyā upahṛtam,</span> real thing is devotion. Not the food. Kṛṣṇa does not accept any food of this material world. But He accepts only the devotion. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">, tad aham aśnāmi bhaktyā upahṛtam.</span> "Because it has been offered to Me with devotional love," that is required. One who has no devotional love, from his hand... Therefore we do not allow anyone to cook who is not a devotee. Kṛṣṇa does not accept anything from the hands of a nondevotee. Why should He accept? He's not hungry. He does not require any food. He accepts only the devotion. That's all. That is the main point. So one has to become a devotee, not a good cooker. But if he's a devotee, then he'll be a good cook also. <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.</span> Automatically he'll become a good cook. Therefore one has to become devotee only; then all other good qualification will automatically be there. And if he's a nondevotee, any good qualification has no value. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇā mano-rathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's on the mental plane. So he has no good qualification. [break] The time?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I still have..., do not understand so much about what you're telling me about the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> But if you like I'll think about it and ask, ask you again tomorrow. About <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> is always <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So because we are not elevated sufficiently, therefore we do not like some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I found, specifically what I mean, is some was too spicy and hurt my stomach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is also due to ... not appreciate. But Kṛṣṇa should be... The cook should have consideration that Kṛṣṇa must be offered first-class foodstuff. So if he offers something last class, that is not his duty. But Kṛṣṇa can accept anything if it is offered by a devotee, and a devotee also can accept any <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> even if it is spicy. [break] Hiraṇyakaśipu gave his son poison and he drank it nectarine. So for the devotee even it is spicy to other taste, it is very palatable to the devotee. What is the question of spicy? He was offered poison, real poison. [break] ...she also offered Kṛṣṇa poison, but Kṛṣṇa's so nice that "She took Me as My mother." So He took the poison and delivered her. Kṛṣṇa does not take the bad side. Any good man, he does not take the bad side; he takes only the good side. [break] He wanted to make business with my Guru Mahārāja. But he did not take the bad side. He took the good side that "He has come forward to give me some service. So whatever he wanted he gave him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Business with you, what was that? Business with who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, I am talking about my Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, oh, I see. [break] ...question on <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> if I may. Let us say if some devotee has some trouble and does not eat a certain type of food. Like some devotees do not eat ghee because of liver trouble. So these devotees, should they take all the <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I say those who are not perfect devotee, they may discriminate. But a perfect devotee does not discriminate. So why should you imitate a perfect devotee? So long you have discrimination, you are not a perfect devotee. So artificially why should you imitate a perfect devotee and eat everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh-h.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is, a perfect devotee does not make any discrimination. Whatever is offered to Kṛṣṇa, it is nectar. That's all. Just like exactly Kṛṣṇa accepts anything from a devotee. "Whatever is offered to Me by My devotee," He accepts. The same thing for a devotee. [break] ...point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The perfect devotee does not make any discrimination. But if I am not a perfect devotee, I have got discrimination, why shall I imitate a perfect devotee? That will not be possible to assimilate or digest. Because I am not a perfect devotee. These things are... A devotee should not be a foolish man. It is said that <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa yei bhaje se baḍa catura.</span> So a devotee knows his position and he's intelligent enough to deal with others accordingly. [break] ...it is posted? The... Specifically, it is prescribed that one should perform <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajña</span> means to act for satisfaction of Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said... So shall I stop this fan? I think you can stop. You got? Otherwise much mosquitoes may disturb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I have a sweater here if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So good <span class="Italic">karma</span> means performance of the <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> as they are prescribed in the Vedic literature. And this purpose of this <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. Just like good citizen means one who satisfies the government. Law-abiding. Good citizen. Similarly, good <span class="Italic">karma</span> means who satisfies Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Lord. Unfortunately, the modern civilization, they do not know what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and what to speak of satisfying Him. They do not know. They are simply busy in material activities. Therefore, all of them are doing only bad <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and therefore they are suffering. They are blind men and leading some other blind men. And both of them are expanding the path to hell by bad <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Bad <span class="Italic">karma,</span> you suffer. That is very easy to understand. If you do something criminal, you'll suffer. If you do something benevolent for the state, for the people, then you are rewarded, you are recognized, you are given title. Sometimes shot. This is good and bad <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So... (microphone noise) ...some material happiness, and bad <span class="Italic">karma</span> means you suffer from material distress. By good <span class="Italic">karma</span> you get birth in good family, <span class="Italic">janma.</span> You get riches, good money. Then you become learned scholar, you become beautiful also. Sit down. There is some trouble with your leg? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There is an infection in this ankle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ankle? Oh, there was some... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> ...who is not very aware of God, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he's an animal. The animal does not know what is God. A person who does not know what is God or one who does not try to understand what is God, he's animal. The animals are with four legs, and that animal is with two legs. And Darwin's theory is they are monkeys. So anyone who does not know God or does not try to understand God, he's nothing but animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What about the people in the...the innocent people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The animal is very innocent. You cut its throat, it won't protest. So innocent is not very good qualification. The animals are all innocent. Therefore you get the chance of cutting their throat. So just... To become innocent is not a very good qualification. Our proposition is one must be very, very intelligent, and then he can understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa yei bhaje se baḍa catura.</span> So to become innocent, ignorant, simpleton is not very good qualification. Simplicity is all right, but one should not be unintelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Can you tell me again what intelligence is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intelligence means one who knows what he is, what is this world, what is God, what is the interrelation, he's intelligent. If he does not know what he is... The animal does not know what he is. He thinks that he's body. Similarly, any man who does not know what he is, he's not intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What about a person who does, tries to do what is right and is very conscientious instead of being unconscientious about the things he does? Like the servant who is very honest to his master, but if he was not honest he knows he would not be caught. But he stays honest anyway, a person like that. Is that some kind of good <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, to become honest is also good <span class="Italic">karma.</span> How to become good man, they're described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Daivī sampad</span> and <span class="Italic">asurī sampad.</span> These are very elaborately described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So if you become qualified with the <span class="Italic">daivī sampad,</span> then <span class="Italic">daivī sampad vimokṣāya</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 16.5]<span class="Italic">,</span> then you'll be liberated. And <span class="Italic">nibandhāyāsurī matā.</span> And if you are qualified with the demonic qualification, then you'll be more and more entangled. Unfortunately, the modern civilization, they do not know what is liberation and what is entanglement. They're so much ignorant. They do not know... Suppose if I ask you, "What do you mean by liberation?" Can you answer? And if I ask you, "What do you mean by entanglement?" Can you answer? These words are there in the Vedic literature. Liberation and entanglement. But at the present moment they do not know even what is liberation, what is entanglement. They're so ignorant and foolish, and still, they're proud of their advancement in knowledge. Can you answer what is liberation? You are a professor, teacher, but if I ask you, can you explain what is liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Not adequately because if I could explain, then I would be becoming liberated very fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you do not know what is liberation, then how fast and slow liberation? (laughs) There is no question of liberation. It is neither fast nor slow. You first know what is liberation. If you do not know where the train is going, then what is the use of asking or understanding fast and slow? You do not know your destination. What is liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Umm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am asking. You daily ask me; I am asking you today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Okay, yes. (laughs) I'll think for a moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Shall I turn this off, this fan? It's cool now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. No, he'll do. Where is Nanda Kumāra? He can do. [break] ...is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> er, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The exact Sanskrit word for liberation is called <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> So that <span class="Italic">mukti</span> is defined in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:</span> <span class="Italic">muktir hitvānyathā rūpaṁ svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> One should stop doing all nonsense, and he must be situated in his original position. But this is also more embarrassing because nobody knows what is his original position. And how to act properly. <span class="Italic">Muktir hitvānyathā rūpam.</span> People are generally acting differently. But they do not know what is differently and what is properly. So much ignorant are the modern population about their life. It is very, very awkward position. They do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> [break] ...who is honest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not know what is honesty. How he can be honest? If you know what is honesty, then you can become honest. But you do not know what is honesty. What is honesty? First of all explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Honesty is doing what you really feel is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then a thief is feeling that "I must steal to provide my children. It is right." Does it mean that he's honest? Everyone thinks... The butcher, he thinks, "It is my life. I must cut throat of the animals daily." Just like that, what is that, <span class="Italic">vyādha, vyādha...</span> When Nārada Muni met him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, Mṛgāri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Mṛgāri. "Why you are killing in this way?" "Oh, it is my business. My father taught it." So he was honestly doing that. So feeling of honesty depends on different culture. A thief's culture is different. He thinks stealing is honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So what is honesty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is my question. (laughter) Real honesty is that you should not encroach upon other's property. This is honesty. Just like this is my table. If you want to take it away while going, is that honesty? No. So therefore the simple definition of honesty is that you should not encroach upon other's right. That is honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So somebody who is honest will be in the mode of goodness. Would that be correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Certainly. Because mode of goodness means knowledge. So if you know, if you're well conversant that "This table does not belong to me; it belongs to Swamiji," so you'll not try to take it away. Therefore one must know, be thoroughly well conversant; then he can be honest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So... Now, you had said the mode of goodness was knowledge of God, but somebody may be honest without having very much knowledge of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> You know, without being honest, without thinking they're honest because it is God's wishes, they just feel like they ought to be honest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God wishes everyone should be honest. Why God should think otherwise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So you may follow God's wishes without knowing you are following God's wishes. Like somebody may be in the mode of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Without knowing following, that is absurd. Without knowing following that is absurd. You must know that this is the order of God. And if you follow that, then that is honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But somebody would not be honest without knowing God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because God is the supreme proprietor. See... God is the supreme proprietor and He's the supreme enjoyer and He's the supreme friend. That is the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If anyone knows these three things, then he is in full knowledge. These three things only, that God is the proprietor of everything, God is friend of everyone, and God is the enjoyer of everything. Just like the same example, in your body... Everyone knows in the body the stomach is the enjoyer. Not the hands, legs, eyes, ears. They are simply to help the stomach. Eyes, the vulture goes seven miles up to see where is food for the stomach. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That's so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the wings fly there, and the jaws catch the food, and after all he puts into the mouth. Similarly, as in this body, this particular example, the stomach is the enjoyer, similarly, the central figure of whole cosmic manifestation, material or spiritual, the central figure is Kṛṣṇa, God. He's the enjoyer. We can understand. As in my this particular body, the body is also a creation. The body has got the same mechanism as you will find out in the whole universe. The same mechanical, anywhere you go, you find even in animals or human body or in the cosmic manifestation. Almost the same mechanism. So as you understand very easily that in this body, my body, your body, the stomach is the enjoyer. Or there is a central enjoyer. And the stomach is friend also of everyone. Because if we cannot digest food, you see, then all other limbs of the body they become weak. Therefore stomach is the friend. It is digesting and distribute the energy to all the limbs of the body. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, the central stomach of the whole creation is God, or Kṛṣṇa. He's the enjoyer and He's the friend. He's maintaining everyone. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Therefore He's friend of everyone. And everywhere... He is maintaining means everywhere He's the proprietor. Just like a king can maintain the whole country, citizens, because he's the proprietor. Without being proprietor, how he can become everyone's friend? So these things have to be understood, that Kṛṣṇa is the enjoyer, Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor, and Kṛṣṇa is friend. If you know these three things, then your knowledge is full. You do not require to understand anything more. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati</span> (<span class="calibre3">Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</span> 1.3)<span class="Italic">.</span> If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa by these three formulas, then your knowledge is complete. You don't require any more knowledge. But people will not agree. "Why Kṛṣṇa shall be proprietor? Hitler shall be proprietor. Yayha Khan should be proprietor. (laughter) Nixon shall be proprietor." That is going on. Therefore you are in trouble. But if you understand these three things only, then your knowledge is finished. But he'll not accept, he'll put forward so many impediments for understanding these three things. And that is the cause of our trouble. But <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is plainly said,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>5.29]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">But we won't take this. We shall put forward so many false proprietor, false friends, false enjoyer, and they will fight one another. This is the situation of the world. If this education is given and people takes this knowledge, there is peace, <span class="Italic">śāntim ṛcchati.</span> Immediately there is peace. This is knowledge. And if anyone follows this principle, he's honest. He does not claim "It is mine." He everything knows it is Kṛṣṇa's, so therefore everything should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's service. That is honesty. If this pencil belongs to me the etiquette is... Just like my students sometimes do: "Can I use this pencil?" "Yes." This is etiquette, I say, "Yes, you can." Similarly, if I know that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, without His permission I'll not use. That is honesty. And that is knowledge. And one does not know, he's ignorant, he's foolish, and foolish man commits all criminality. All criminals, they're foolish men. Out of ignorance one commits lawbreaking. So ignorance is not bliss, but it is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. That is the difficulty, our. The whole world is enjoying ignorance, and when we say about Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they do not very much appreciate. If I say, "Kṛṣṇa is the proprietor, you are not proprietor," he'll not be very much satisfied. (laughs) Just see, ignorance is bliss. So it is my foolishness to say the real truth. Therefore this is, it is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. So we are taking the risk to offend people because they'll think we are fools. If I say, "Birla, Mr. Birla, you are not proprietor, Kṛṣṇa is proprietor. So whatever money you have got spend for Kṛṣṇa," he'll be angry. <span class="Italic">Mūrkha upadeśo hi prakopāya na śāntaye.</span> If you instruct a rascal, he'll be angry. Therefore we go as beggar. "My dear Mr. Birla, you are very rich man. I am <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> beggar. So I want to construct a temple if you spare some money." So he'll be, "Oh, here is a beggar, give him some money." (laughter) But if I say "Mr. Birla, you have got millions of dollars at your disposal. That is Kṛṣṇa's money. Give it to me. I am Kṛṣṇa's servant." Oh, he will... (laughter) He'll not be very satisfied. Rather, if I go as a beggar, he would give something, and if I tell him the truth, he'll not give me a farthing. Therefore we take this beggar's dress. We are not beggar. We cheat him as beggar. We are not beggar. We are Kṛṣṇa's servant, we are not beggar. We don't want anything from anyone. Because we know Kṛṣṇa will provide everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Ahh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is knowledge. Just like a child sometimes takes something important. He'll not spare it. So we have to flatter, "Oh, you are so nice, please take these lozenges and give me that paper. Hundred rupees, it is nothing. It is paper." (laughter) And he will, "Oh, yes, take. That's nice. That two-paise lozenges is very nice. It is sweet." So we have to do like that. Why? Because he'll go to hell taking Kṛṣṇa's money. So some way or other, take some money from him and engage in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> And then he may not go to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You save him from going to hell. Because a farthing spent for Kṛṣṇa it will be accounted, "Oh, this man has given a farthing." This is called <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti. Ajñāta-sukṛti</span> means doing pious activities without knowledge. So we give everyone chance to act very piously without his knowledge. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. <span class="Italic">Mahad-vicalanaṁ nṝṇāṁ gṛhīṇāṁ dīna-cetasām. Dīna-cetasām.</span> They're very poor in their thought. Therefore the saintly persons work(?) just to enlighten him little, to give him chance to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is saintly person's study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> That is what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if he takes money from other and utilizes for his sense gratification, then he goes to hell. Then it is finished. Then he's a cheater. Actually, he is criminal. You cannot take money, a farthing from anyone. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> I think of people I know who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa means God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Oh, yeah. Are not very, are just slightly God conscious, but still these people are honest to the extent they don't take, they don't take from other people at all and they try to be honest with other people. Will these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not take from other people, but he takes from God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So these people are half good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> These people then are half good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not half God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Half good, good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not good. If he does not know this principle, that God is the proprietor... Others' thing, what do you mean by others' thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Like, people I'm thinking of, they're poor people who need money and food, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone needs money. Everyone needs. Who is not poor? Anyone find out. So many gentlemen sitting here. Who is not in need of food and money? You are also in need of money. So what do you distinguish poor and rich? Everyone needs. If that is your definition, if one needs money and food, everyone needs money and food. So everyone is poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> So, but, well, I was thinking of terms of just people who are relatively poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No relatively. Relatively maybe. You are more hungry than me. But that does not mean you are not hungry or I am not hungry. I don't feel hungry now, that does not mean I do not feel hungry or I am not hungry. For the time being you may not be hungry. Tomorrow you'll be hungry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> What I feel is that somehow these people that... Everybody around them may be stealing, but they still stand up and don't steal. That these people somehow deserve something good to happen to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the man who is thinking that he's not stealing, he's also a thief. Because he does not know that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore whatever he's accepting, he's stealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Is he less of a thief?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not know that I am the proprietor of this wrapper, but if you take it away, are you not steal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> But, maybe it isn't... If I know it is yours and I take it I'm a worse thief than if I do not know whose it is and I just think it may be nobody's and I take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also stealing. Because it must belong to somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you take it without his permission? You may not know exactly who is the proprietor, but you must know, "It must belong to somebody." That is knowledge. Sometimes we see on the road so many valuable things are lying, government property. You see? For repairing roads or electrical, so many things, valuable things are lying down. But a man may think that it is "Fortunately, it is lying there; so I take it." Is it not stealing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> It is stealing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He does not know that these are all government property. He takes away. That is stealing. And when he's caught he's arrested and he's punished. So similarly, whatever you are collecting... Suppose you are drinking a glass of water from the river. Is the river your property?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? It is stealing. You have not created the river. You do not know who is the proprietor. Therefore it is not your property. So even if you drink a glass of water without the knowledge to whom it belongs you are a thief. So you think, "I'm honest." But factually you are thief. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) <span class="Italic">Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> You must remember Kṛṣṇa that "Kṛṣṇa, it is Your creation, so kindly allow me to drink it." This is honesty. This is honesty. Therefore a devotee always thinks of Kṛṣṇa in all activities. "Oh, it is Kṛṣṇa's." <span class="Italic">Sarvatra sphuraya tara iṣṭa-deva mūrti.</span> This is honesty. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) So without Kṛṣṇa consciousness everyone is a rascal, is a thief, is a rogue, is a robber, these qualifications. Therefore our conclusion is anyone who does not understand Kṛṣṇa, he has no good qualification. Neither he's honest, neither he has knowledge. Therefore he's a third-class man. Is that correct? What do you think, Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not dogmatism, this is fact. (Speaks to someone in Bengali) [break] ...you have understood what is knowledge and what is honesty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> In a way, in a way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if there is other way to defy it? Is there any other way? You defy it. (laughs) If there another way? Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any alternative? To defy it? We do not say anything which can be defied by anyone. That experience we have got. Rather, we defy it. "Any question?" Till now. And Kṛṣṇa gives us protection. In big, big meeting, in big, big country, after speaking I ask, "Any question?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Now...I have none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In London, we had, how many days lecture in that, what is that, Conway Hall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Twelve days. Conway Hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Conway Hall, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Twelve days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So after every meeting I was asking, "Any question?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Did you get many questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Many foolish questions. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Let me ask one more question. What is being foolish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foolish means who has no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> No knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolish. Is it not foolish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Having no knowledge? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Prabhupāda, I have one personal question, can I ask?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Some time ago in Calcutta they observed a week. It was named "Prevention of Cruelty to Animals."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. (Chuckles) This is another foolishness. They are advertising prevention of cruelty and they are maintaining thousands of slaughterhouse. You see? That is another foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, I wanted just to ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Asking, before asking, I give you the answer. (laughter) That is another foolishness. They're regularly cruel to the animals, and they're making society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Maybe this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a gang of thieves gives a signboard, "Goodman and Company." A gang of thieves are giving signboard, "Goodman and Company." You sometimes find such signboard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Our landlord in San Francisco temple, his name was Goodman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their philosophy is that the animal, when it is not properly nourished that is cruelty. Therefore instead of allowing to starve, better kill him. Like that, theory. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bob:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, "Oh, it is better to kill him than to give him so much..." That theory is coming in communist country. That an old man, grandfather, is suffering. Better kill him. And there, in Africa, there is a class of nation they eat, make a festival, by killing great-grandfather and grandfather. Is it not? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They eat them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> I had an uncle and aunt. They were in the army so when they went overseas, they could not take their dog with them. So they said, "The poor dog, he will be so heartbroken not to be with us," that they had him put to sleep. They killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Gandhi's life also, he once killed one calf or some cow. It was suffering very much. So Gandhi ordered that "Instead of suffering, just kill him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yesterday you said that the spiritual master may have to suffer due to the sinful activities of his disciple. What do you mean by sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sinful activity means therefore you promised that "I shall follow the regulative principles." If you do not, that is sinful. That is the promise. That is sinful. You break your promise and do nasty things; therefore you are sinful. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. (pause) But there are some things we're instructed to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There are other things which we're instructed to do which even though we try to do we cannot do perfectly yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that? You try to do and cannot do? How it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Like chanting attentively. Sometimes we try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not fault. Suppose you are trying to do something and due to your inexperience you sometimes fail, that is not fault. You are trying. There is a verse in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> that a devotee is trying his best, but due to his incapability he sometimes fails. So Kṛṣṇa excuses. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also it is said, <span class="Italic">api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> By, due to his bad habit, past, sometimes, not willingly, but due to his habit, habit is second nature, he does something nonsense. But that does not mean he is faulty. But he must repent for that, that "I have done this." And should try to avoid as far as possible. But habit is the second nature. Sometimes, in spite of our trying hard, the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is so strong, push me into pitfalls. That can be excused. Kṛṣṇa excuses. But those who are doing willingly something, that is not excused. On the strength that "I am a devotee, I am chanting. Therefore I may commit all this nonsense, it will be nullified." That is the greatest offense. (end)</div>
