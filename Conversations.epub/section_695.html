<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were born here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, where is your shoes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Oh, I got it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are Gujarati? So you have been in India? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...my dad stopped... [break] ...Nairobi... [break] Indian parents are, they try to grab hold of you before you can go away. He thought that I won't come back or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was right, your father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He was right. Yes. Well, you see, I didn't want to come back and get married and all that, you see? And then he forced me to get married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you married? Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Here, Durban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. Two boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was talking just now that the Indians here are better situated than in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Than in India. Correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi started his movement here. He was failure. But in India it is supposed to be successful. But at the present moment, after independence, Indians are very horribly situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Very horribly situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no food even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yeah. Is it because of the people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May be. What is the cause, I do not wish to discuss. But you are better off here. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I was going to India for some knowledge, you see? You know, to the <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> there. And I couldn't go, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How did you know that you'll get some knowledge there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, I read a few books of the Divine Life Society, you know. And I wanted to go to Hrishikesh, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that Divine Life Society? I want to know from you. What is that divinity? Whether it is nonsense or divinity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, at that time I didn't know of anything else. This was in 1966.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you decided that it is divine life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, you see, I read a few books by Swami Shivananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that book? Let me know. What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, he teaches you the basics, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that basics? Why don't you explain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, actually, well, he's got a <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> too, translated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has got everything. Why don't you explain what you have learned from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, he's given us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you have no idea what is divine life, and still, you are going to Divine Life Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, he should teach... Well, the basics were no meat-eating, no intoxicants, and also no gambling and no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say? They have? They say so? They have restriction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, no cheating, no gambling and no cheating. He's got restrictions of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you follow these restrictions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, up to a certain extent I do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that extent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, I don't eat meat, I don't gamble, I don't take any kind of intoxicants, but I drink tea, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that divine life is generally for all the Hindus. That is custom. They may learn here something else, but generally, Hindus, they do not take meat. So, anything else? No. Simply this restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, it's very similar to our movement, you know, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is different in this sense, that we have got Kṛṣṇa. Do they have Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, only thing I could tell you, they teach us to pray to Kālī, Durgā, Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then it is finished. Divine life is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But, you see, at that time there was nothing else for us, Swamijī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We had to follow something, and I didn't hear of you that time. This was in 1966, you know. It was quite a long time, and, well, I only came to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are teaching like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There was only the Divine Life Society as far as I heard that time, you know. There was nobody else to follow, and our surrender was, surrendered ourselves to him, you see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, I have read our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you know what Kṛṣṇa has said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, surrender to Him alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this Kālī, Durgā, and other demigods' worshipers, they have been described as lost of intelligence. That means fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Fools. Those who worship them. Yes. But he also told us we must worship Kṛṣṇa too, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa is to be worshiped-He is the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Supreme Lord, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are fishing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Those people are surfing, you know? Surfboards. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...center of Divine Life here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. It's in Reservoir Hills. Well, it's not far from place where we are living, Reservoir Hills. They've got a big <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> there. They've got a resident swami there, Swami Sahajananda, and they've got a printing press and quarters, their living quarters and all, and they've got a few devotees living there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, they've got about four permanently living and then you get others coming during the day and helping the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they have a very big printing press there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Printing press. Big... More than ours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (laughter) Nobody has a press more than yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, I have seen the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Have they books like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? So many books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, he hasn't got a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> but he's got a few books on Kṛṣṇa and the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> a short <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> actually. It's brief, you know, it's briefed. [break] I think very good sport, swimming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Isn't it refreshing and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The fishes are swimming always, twenty-four hours, they are swimming. So they must be well situated than yourself because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They are swimming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man cannot swim twenty-four hours, but they are swimming twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...holiday. Big beach day. <span class="Italic">Bhoga-tyāga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughs at something)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any woman surfing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very, very few. Not so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all. I don't see any women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're not strong enough. Not strong enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still, they want equal right? [break] ...for jumping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not today, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cannot move. "Big sea"? What is this? No, that's all right. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This boy, Prabhupāda, he bought one of your books in a store, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> While he was in the army he bought a book in a store, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and he read the book, and he came to the temple in Johannesburg and he practically joined immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He very much likes to read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday there was sale, some books? How many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many books were sold last night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Not too many, ten, fifteen big books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think because in Mobeni Heights, where we had the program, we've been there so many times practically everyone has all of your books. One night about two years ago we had a program there, and we sold six hundred dollars' worth of books in one evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They've taken your books in the past. [break] ...preaching, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we don't know whether to be diplomatic towards these other so-called religious movements or whether to simply expose the philosophy which they are putting forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You should be diplomatic. You should give positive information of our philosophy. Where need be, absolutely necessary, you can criticize others. [break] ...preaching is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only because you've sent us here. Otherwise we would have never come to this place in a million years. I think in America the devotees think that Africa is simply a bunch of jungles. No one wants to come here to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break]...very broad. [break] ...ask him about swimming, why they cannot swim all through like the fish. They are defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They can't swim like the fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They have to put the skins on, I mean the rubber.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am pointing out, that they are less efficient than the fish. Even a small fish, you will find, he is enjoying, but he cannot. So why they are proud of becoming more intelligent than the fishes? Where is that intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Uh huh. Well, I thought it was a good sport, you know, to swim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It may be good sport, but you cannot enjoy it. After some time you have to give it up. The fish does not. Therefore fish is more intelligent than this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> On a rainy day is it possible to go swimming? On a rainy day... Some people say you mustn't go near water on a rainy day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I am not speaking in detail. But by practical experience we can see that these men are not as efficient as the small fish. That is my point. They have advanced in civilization, so many scientists' brain, but they are not enough intelligent more than the fish. That is my point. Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Right. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If swimming is enjoyable, then let them swim always. Why they cannot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Actually, I go swimming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the fishes are swimming always. So who is more intelligent, the fish or the man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, summertime I go swimming always, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't speak about yourself. I am speaking generally. You may be very expert, but how long you will swim? How long you can swim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Five minutes. Ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Finished your business. But the fishes are swimming twenty-four hours. If we ask all these young men that "Who is expert? The fish or you are expert?" What will be the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They'll say he is. He will say he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The fish is. The swimmer will say the fishes are expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he says that he is expert more than the fish, then he's a madman. So? Why he cannot become more expert than the fish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because he's not meant to swim all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then in which way he should be expert? He must show his expertness in a different way which the fish cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I suppose, in the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is working of the fish. He knows where is his enemy, where to go. They have got better mind. They can understand from two miles that some enemy is coming. They take care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The mind is so strong. Every fish in the water, although they are expert, they are always in danger. They are always afraid of being eaten by bigger fish. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ mahatāṁ tatra.</span> The world is that the stronger is exploiting the weaker. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ mahatāṁ tatra jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> Still, they are expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Is it possible to visit other planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to be expert. Not by this machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No. Astral traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to prepare yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Prepare yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like we had to prepare, to come to your country, visa and other things, not that all of a sudden I can come. Similarly, you have to prepare yourself to go to other planets. And because they are going whimsically, they are not successful. They have to come back, "Get down. Go back."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, Swamijī, if you want, you can answer this or not. Have you been to other planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am on all planets. When I come to other country I see the same tree, the same road and the same sand. So what is the difference? I don't find any difference between India and this South Africa because the same trees are there, same grass is there, the same road is there, the same... So similarly, in every planet, without going we can understand, if we are sane men. We come here not to see how is South Africa. We have come here to preach Kṛṣṇa conscious.... That is our business. We don't come as a tourist to see how South Africa is. What South Africa? The same building, same road, same-everything same. What to see here? Especially, they are also eating, sleeping and struggling. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That's a stink bug there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Is there any difference between Los Angeles, America or San Francisco and this city? Is there any difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing. Is there any place where people do not die? Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Besides maybe Kṛṣṇaloka also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Within this material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> On earth, everywhere, everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our real problem is to go there, where there is no death. That is real intelligence. And what is the use of going here and there where death is inevitable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Now, in Brahmaloka there is also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Brahmā also dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Brahmā also dies. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...plants are within the sea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Some plants live underneath the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And why these rascals say there is no life? We see underneath the water there is life, and in the moon planet there is no life? We have to believe this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So there is life on the moon, Swamijī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But can you see them? Do they have bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you go there. Then see. I don't admit that they have gone to the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You don't believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is 1,600,000 above the sun, the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> One million six hundred...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thousand miles above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say. They're all fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Quarter million miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't accept them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> 1,600,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how they will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> And the sun is 96,000,000 miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That they cannot go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> 93,000,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Ninety-three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>

At least they discussed or they had some knowledge. You cannot deny that. They're giving description of all the planets, where it is situated. At least they had discussion.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And there is fire, blazing fire, just like the sun. But it is surrounded by cool atmosphere. Therefore it is pleasing. Heat coming through cool atmosphere, it is pleasing. This is the statement. What do they know? They cannot explain why it is so brilliant. We explain, "There is firelike flames; therefore it is brilliant." They say that every planet looks like that. That's not a fact. Then all the planets together, why they cannot illuminate this earth at night? Only the moon is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they give the excuse that all the other stars are so far away that the light doesn't shine bright enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are no other, nearer planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. There are other planets like Venus and Mars, but they say these planets are much closer than the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means... So why they do not look so bright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their philosophy is that the earth, Venus and Mars, these different planets, they don't give off any light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do they say that all the planets look like moon? They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They think the moon is just reflecting light from the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> So why it is not reflecting to other planets, only to the moon? Why special advantage to the moon? They have no reason. All rascals' philosophy. Why particularly to the moon? Why not others? Simply theories and mental speculation. They have no scientific. And the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> definitely gives the distance of the moon from the sun planet-1,600,000 miles. Then similarly [sic:] 1,600 million up, the Mars, then Venus, then..., everything. And moon is specifically mentioned that "It is so brilliant because there is fire, blazing fire. And the blazing fire is so illuminating that even at night it looks white, bright." This is reasonable because... Not that it is being reflected by the sun. The sun can reflect other planets, but it is there, fire. Just like sun there is fire, similarly, moon there is fire. The sun is not covered by cool atmosphere, but the moon is covered by cool atmosphere. Therefore it is pleasing. When there is sunshine and breeze, it is very pleasing. And no sunshine, simply breezing-it is not pleasing. And only sunshine, there is no cool atmo... That is also painful. But sunshine and breezing is very pleasing. So there is, like sunshine, blazing fire and surrounded by cool atmosphere. Therefore the moon is so pleasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a very reasonable argument, but how do we understand that the moon is 1,600,000 miles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Does that mean that it's farther away from the earth than the... Does that mean that the earth is farther from the moon than from the sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly. Sun is in the center of the universe, and other planets there are above the sun and lower the sun. Sun is in the middle of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then the moon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is there. The whole, what is called, radius, no, diameter, from one point to another of the universe is given there. <span class="Italic">Pañcāśat-koṭi-yojana. Pañcāśat</span> means fifty, and <span class="Italic">koṭi</span> means ten million. So fifty into ten million. Huh? 500,000,000. <span class="Italic">Pañcāśat-koṭi.</span> And eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Four billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four billion miles, the area, this way and that way. So if the distance is so vast then one planet situated some millions of miles away, it is not extraordinary. The whole area is four billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But it appears at least for... It appears that the moon is so close.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "It appears"-that is another thing. As soon as you say "appears," that means you have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we say on the authenticity of the description in the Vedic literature. Therefore it is authentic. This proves that they did not go to the moon planet. If it is above, 1,600,000 above, then it is impossible. So this is bogus propaganda, they have gone to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a very reasonable proposition because going to the moon, they simply come back with some rocks. Rocks they can get on the earth also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all nonsense. Some sand and some rocks, and we have to believe they have gone to. The fools may believe, but we cannot believe. We have got other information. Why shall I believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So all of the politicians are taking the money and they're saying that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. That's all. Exploiting, that's all. This is their business. Just like Pakistan politicians, as soon as they cannot supply food, they declare war with India. The attention is diverted. Here also we have seen in the last war. When no man was joining, so in India, they created artificial famine. So for want of food they joined military. The government created a situation, purchased all the food grains and stocked. And when the price is very high the government opened controlled shop at high price. The people had no money; therefore they were obliged to join military. These polit..., demons, they are so dangerous, simply to keep their position they are doing all nefarious activities. Simply there is... Because they don't believe in the next birth, they are not afraid of sinful activities. They can do anything, "Whatever I like. There is no... This life is finished." That is the whole philosophy of the modern educated man, "There is no life." Big, big professors, they say like that, "There is no life after death." Therefore the <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājī</span> rascal was: "That is Hindu belief." Why Hindu belief? Does the Mohammedan do not grow old? That answer he could not give. He is such a rascal. And at last he said that "I am God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are dogmatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dogmatic, no. Why we should waste our time talking with such foolish men? "I don't believe." No, what... You believe or not believe; fact is fact. You are going to be old man. If you say "I don't believe," then is that a very good proposition? It does not depend on your believing or not believing. The nature's course will take place. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> That will go on. What is there in your believing and not believing? If you keep yourself in such darkness that "If you believe, then it is fact," then you are a fool, rascal. If you depend only on your belief, then you are a fool. What is the meaning of your belief? "I believe if I touch fire it will not burn." Will this belief protect me? You touch fire; it will burn. You believe or not believe. What is this argument, "We don't believe"? This is going on. If nature's law is that you must die, then if you believe, "No, I'll not die," will that belief protect you? You have to submit to the nature's law. Why don't you understand this? You are talking of "believe and not believe." Whole world is going on in this way: "We think," "I suppose," "Perhaps," "I believe," like this. Where is science? Science does not depend on your "belief, not belief, supposing, perhaps." This is not science. But they are going on like that. Whole Darwin's theory is based on this, "Maybe millions of years past..." We want perfect knowledge, not such, what is called, <span class="Italic">saṁśayam.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaṁ,</span> "without any doubt." That is knowledge. And <span class="Italic">samagram,</span> "complete." So if we have got the chance of knowing complete, without any doubt, so why shall I go to you, rascal? Your knowledge is based on "perhaps, maybe." I will have to go somewhere to take knowledge, so why not go to Kṛṣṇa, where the knowledge is complete and without any doubt? Why shall I go to you, you rascal? You simply say "maybe, perhaps, I think." What is the use of this knowledge? We don't accept. You cannot say that "You are right; I am wrong" because you are also going to somebody to get knowledge, I am also going to somebody to get knowledge. So here it assured, that "complete knowledge without any doubt." But you have no such confidence. Am I right or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The difficulty arises in... We say, well, you have to grow old. And then we say the moon is so high above the sun. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how can you deny it? First of all tell me. You have not gone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I haven't gone, but the argument...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The scientists. I challenge that he has not gone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> (to someone:) Pay your obeisances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> I have not gone, you have not gone, but I have got this authentic literature; you have nothing. So my position is better than yours. You are fool. You are befooled because you are simply contemplating. But I have got a definite literature, information. So my position is better than yours. Whose car is it? Oh, some of them are chanting? <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
