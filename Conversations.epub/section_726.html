<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's a military school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A military school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Military school or military barracks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, a military school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 420,000...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Four fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have paid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are going to pay 150,000 in January. It looks perfect for Gurukula.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How far? It is in Chicago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's about, I think, an hour and a half from Chicago by car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It is a village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...the description?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many buildings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, there's about nine buildings. There's a main administration building and classroom building. There is two new buildings. One is a dining hall that seats two hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to passerby) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...the Gujaratis would never keep dogs but now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are becoming civilized. (laughter) Advanced. [break] Therefore I made this trust: fifty percent, fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So there will always be money for purchasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And because we are doing that, Kṛṣṇa is giving us facility. [break] ...ning how much difficulty we had. We could not purchase that house, number sixty street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. That was a hundred thousand dollars, that house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not hundred. Sixty. Sixty thousand dollars. Sixty thousand dollars, and still, we could not. Another attempt was made to purchase that bank building. So we had no money, only five thousand, and that was also taken away. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Do you believe in these (Hindi) and everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Do you believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? There are many <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotees. Here is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...which you want to set up, they are available, ready-made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Some of them are ready, but we need about a hundred, so I don't think there will be one hundred ready. But if the order is placed in advance, then they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> If the order is placed in advance, then they will start making immediately. They can do that very fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever ready-made we can purchase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, it has to be the proper size also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes. They can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They have many men. They can very quickly carve those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What is it you were saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, it's... Fixing has to be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Domes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Domes, yes. Also the time will go in the domes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Lot of time will go in the domes because there's many, many towers. Pillars is not so difficult. [break] ...two men have been making sketches on different designs for panels and columns, and as soon as you decide to pay, then they can start work immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have decided. Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. It takes them about ten more days, fourteen days to get the drawings done. It will be all done in Makrana. They carve it there. They won't do it here. And then they bring it. Only small carvings will be done. There they have all facilities and many, many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They have <span class="Italic">kaligarhs.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Very quickly that will be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> [break] Would you like to have a temple established in every village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> I heard at the Long Island temple that you did not want to have a temple in every village right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not say anything about Long Island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> You'd like many temples, one in every village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has said. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipramukhya:</span> ...bring Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the people, they don't have to travel long distances to the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...fast, these birds. Airplane cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> How do they decide the direction and they turn all together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> How they turn all together and how do they communicate each other that "Yes, let's move out away"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have got intelligence. You are thinking that they have no intelligence. They have got complete intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They have, but how do they all together decide to either turn right or left or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence. You do not know that. If you are given airplane, so many, you'll, immediately at least half a dozen will be finished. (laughter) That means you are less intelligent than the birds, at least in the matter of flying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you wanted to construct apartment house. Is it possible to do now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Because we don't have the required garden space yet. We have to break down the huts in the back. There's some hutments there, and unless those are removed, we cannot do any other construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We can make plan including hut but we can begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Then we are short of S of I.(?) We don't have. All these houses have to be broken down to get more space and also the sufficient S of I to plan the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we have got sufficient S of I.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, but we need... We require a certain area for garden, and that is not there yet. Minimum garden has to be, and we have about three-quarter of that. So unless you make another garden first, we cannot make, according to the architects. But maybe with, er, by paying some money in advance, that we promise them that, say, after so much time we will break these houses down, then they may agree, like they agreed on the old house that we had to pay six hundred rupees, and as soon as we break the house down we get six hundred rupees back. Then they know that we will break it down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The old house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, old house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Otherwise they won't allow us to build a temple so close to that place. The same problem is with those hutment. In order to build the building they have be moved or we have to promise them that within a certain time we will break them down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> If we keep the garden around the back of the temple and the front. Remember we discussed that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. We have to... But as long as that house is there, we can't do that. The old house is there too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> We've already agreed to remove the old house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, but one has to have the open area as garden in order to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So in the layout there's room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, but it's not there yet. You either have to break down the old house or the hutment. But it may be now, because the situation is more favorable, that they allow, that they believe us. We can try it. We will make a design for the whole building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Including that... And request them to come to our, one of the top floor. And as soon as the building is... They'll... In this way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> ...plan and we make everything to submit to the municipality and then we will hear from them what is required and we will try to do that, whatever they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Now there is two things. We can make big apartments for which most people are anxious actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Those apartment buildings. Make them very opulent and big. They want... Some people told me they like to have apartments of 2,000 square feet for one apartment. It should have four big rooms, a kitchen, everything, very opulent. Like this we can have on one floor two of them. We can have 4,000 square feet on one floor. It is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do that. Do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And then we make five like this, six, five or six. Then put... For those buildings one can get about 150. I think here at least 150 rupees per square foot minimum. I think it will... By the time we are having it built there'll be more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So try for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Some buildings, it's already 175. Build a parlor so that each...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The tenants will advance money. If you open office they will pay advance. You can go on constructing. If not, we shall take money from Bank of America. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> ...make a parking under the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Take this building. Lease parking space under there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Every one of them like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> The building will be about big like this, this size.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it. [break] ...please come and take <span class="Italic">prasādam. (kīrtana)</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Make a plan here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> This one. The other one is very complicated with very big... It's got wood, very big columns. (end)</div>
