<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not whimsically. That will not... That is a bad example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, yes. Otherwise it will become a hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Otherwise it will become a hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hotel we are preparing also, transcendental hotel. But they must pay for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. I think it is perfectly right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise what will be the impression of the <span class="Italic">sādhus, </span>that one treatment to one and one treatment to another? Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...require, everything is there by God's arrangement. [break] ...heavy load, there is elephant, truck. Elephant is truck, horse is carriage. Everything is there by nature's... And for small load, the bulls, the asses. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Where he is? He has gone back? In the kitchen they are preparing tea? They are preparing tea in the kitchen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Tea. Was he making tea in his kitchen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I didn't know that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Nanda Kumara, you see me. I shall talk with you at half past eleven. [break] ...from this side. [break] ...flies. So do the modern botanists, er, biologists know all these things? In our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is, <span class="Italic">jalaja nava-lakṣani sthavara lakṣa-viṁśati, kṛmayo rudra-śaṅkhyakaḥ.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They cannot understand one species of life. How can they understand 8,400,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">śāstra </span>has described so many things. It has no value. And whatever nonsense they'll talk, that is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's because the <span class="Italic">śāstra </span>is not very practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's not very practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not practical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because you can't do anything with it. You just read it and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can press your throat and kill you immediately. (laughter) He can do this. Do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then? That is the practical thing for the demons. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">]. </span>When <span class="Italic">Hiraṇyakaśipu </span>met with <span class="Italic">Nṛsiṁhadeva,</span> "Yes, sir, yes. You are here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But that's all mythology. That kind of thing never really happens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When it happens, you will see. Wait for few years. Do you think death will not happen to you? You are so fool to think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's still going to happen to me even if I read these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The books are there, what is happening actually, that's all. Books... Therefore it is practical because what is written in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that is happening. Therefore it is practical. [break] Throughout this age, the symptoms of <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> they are happening practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> [break] ...all the Māyāvādīs, transcendentalists, they also don't believe in <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> This one man, he is a great devotee of one so-called swāmī, and he was quoting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>inside and out. And then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He doesn't believe in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> No. He doesn't believe in Kṛṣṇa. He comes to the words that "You surrender everything to Kṛṣṇa." Then he says, "Well, actually this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>is written by some man, unknown man." So I said, "What is the value of it then? Why are you quoting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā? </span>Why are you learning it?" "It is knowledge, very nice knowledge." "So any knowledge imparted by any mundane man, what value does it have?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you accept it? What is the use of quoting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. That they will not do because they know they can make money by quoting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. </span>People will not accept anybody if they openly say that they don't believe in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was going on. It is the first time. We are pressing: "You must take it seriously." It is the first time. Otherwise this was going on, at least for the last two hundred years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And then when we say that a devotee goes to Vaikuṇṭha, this and that, "Oh, Vaikuṇṭha and all those things are just myth, just baloney."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are authority, you rascal. You are authority. Everything is myth, you are simply truth. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Reality and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where everything is myth, then why you are truth? You are also myth. Everything is myth, so you are also myth. What is the use of talking nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They believe in whatever is existing now. Whatever is existing now, or whatever they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is not existing which is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gita. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. </span>Still people say, "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" "I am <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span>" "I am this," "I am that." It is existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They would even believe the mundane historians more than the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> The historians have very funny stories. The Aryans came from the northeast Asia or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Central Asia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Central Asia and inhabited in India. Then the Indian civilization sprang. Everybody thinks that India was not originally inhabited. It was all inhabited by the Dravidians, and then the Dravidians were pushed into the South and then Aryans dominated them. Whatever they learn in the schools. And because they have this theory, therefore they have to date all the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> after, either after Christ or just a few centuries before Christ. [break] ...<span class="Italic">bhārata,</span> they say, it must have been a small family feud and some poet's imagination made it a big war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "May be. May not be." (laughter) We say, "may not be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata </span>was written 1400 B.C., and that date correlates with dates of the Egyptian and Greek Empire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, so many dates have been quoted there. Which is correct? That is our question. So many dates they have discussed. And which one is correct? Either everyone is correct or everyone is incorrect. This is the... There cannot be many dates; that is not possible. Date must be one. So which one is correct? Who will answer this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Everyone has a different opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Recently they had a big questioning in the... (too faint) ...newspapers what the outcome would be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> And your Godbrother Swāmī Bon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know that. He is also one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He established... (too faint)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others, they do not accept. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Funny thing is that some of the historians, they say, "There was no war like <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> It's all fictitious. There's nothing like Kurukṣetra." Some historians say that there is Kurukṣetra and there is evidences of war of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> But none of them completely agree with the scriptures. They all have their own fantastic theories, even those who say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why shall I accept them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> How can we prove the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot prove. Our proof is already there. They cannot prove. Why don't you take that point, that these rascals, they are contradictory to one another, so they cannot prove. Our proof is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is what we should aim at. We should aim at "You cannot prove your..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot prove. You are contradictory. So why shall I accept you or he? We accept our own proof. That's all. First of all you agree amongst yourselves; then question us. You cannot agree. Why shall I believe you? One says that "He is wrong" and the other says "He is wrong." Now we say "You are both wrong. We reject you." Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> But how can we impress the masses that we are right, the innocent people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not historians, rascals. They will believe <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata. </span>They are not so-called historians, scientists. They still believe in the Vedic standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> People in general.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They're actually doing that. They may believe or not believe; our belief is going on all over the world. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Phalena pariciyate. </span>Hare Kṛṣṇa. We don't make any compromise. What we believe, we are preaching that. People are accepting. So you believe or not believe; it doesn't matter for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> [break] ...just institutions, they also say "Indian mythology."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have been taught like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And they put out books on <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata </span>or Rāmacandra, "Indian mythology."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who cares for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Ninety-nine per cent of the people are completely misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not ninety-nine per cent. Maybe nine percent. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> As a matter of fact, science is not revealing itself now. Science is also realizing that it is not the way to realize God. Science is, when you were a student at college was much different than what it is today, sir, to tell the truth. The scientists have realized that they are nothing before, before all that they observe and the director of all that action, themselves and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.<span class="Italic"> Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Jaya Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Svarūpa Dāmodara is real scientist. He is admitting. That is stated in the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. What is that? <span class="Italic">Yad-uttama-śloka-guṇanuvarṇanam</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

Why these things are required? What is the meaning of becoming advanced in such things? <span class="Italic">Avicyuto 'rthaḥ: </span>"Without any doubt, the <span class="Italic">artha, </span>the conclusion, is that they should describe the wonderful activities of the Supreme Person." Then it is perfect education. And these rascals, they are saying, "Now we don't require God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, sir, but these great scientists like Huxley were all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have realized the working of God in every atom, to tell the truth. It was so some fifty years back that the scientists did not believe in the existence and working of God, but they have much changed now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they were foolish; now they are coming to be wise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they have died out, the previous generation. Now the new generation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, still there are, so many rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There cannot be uniformity of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many rascals. One scientist came to talk with me in California. And he: "God? What is God? We have now solved everything." And you are rascal, demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He should be asked to "Make a single living cell yourself. We'll give you all the ingredients, all the chemicals, and make us a living cell. If you can make it?" That should be the answer to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are so foolish. I very strongly talk with them. Still, stubborn, doggish. That scientist, I told him in his..., that "You are a demon." I told him, "You are a demon." So he tolerated. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are serving the Mammon and not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so many psychologists, psychiatrists, scientists, they come there in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, the psychologists are the real science which can lead a man to the higher understanding of life, psychologists. The abstract sciences of biology and psychics, chemistry, are little lower sciences. The psychology is much higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No science is perfect.<span class="Italic"> Asato dhavato bahiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In imperfection also there can be gradations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gradations, that I give the example: stool, this side and that side, the dry side and the moist side. Somebody says, "Oh, this side is very good. It is dry stool." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have to examine in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is very good example. Stool is stool, but they are thinking, "This side is very good because it is dried up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We see a thing from any angle, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this is also one of the angle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Scientists have got different angle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no different angle. It is foolishness. Stool is stool, this side or... If you say, "This angle is very..." The same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The human stool is a stool for the human being. Does it not become a food for a stray dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is human stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That you see. Does it not become the food for a stray dog, sir? That you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore we say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When I was a small boy I was very much wondering how this filth that is cast away from human body can nourish the dog's body. But that is the bountifulness of God, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Just like that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now don't talk. (laughter) I was a professor in the college, so I am very sorry. This particular habit is lurking me as yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> māyā is killing the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Gujarati) But that is what it is, sir. Really, it set me thinking when I was a small baby boy, how this could maintain the body of a dog if there was no something in it. It is a very important thing to understand. Think about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...good substance, very good substance. Stool is full of hypophosphates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whatever it is, but there it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was analyzed by a big doctor. You know that Dr. Ghosh who came? Dr. Ghosh from Allahabad? So one day I went to his house, and I saw in a plate something yellow is kept. And "What is this, doctor?" "Oh, that is stool to be examined."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The stool, so long it is in your body, it is you, a part of you, because we are all, majority of us are body conscious. There are very few people like you, who are so conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Māyāvāda philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are in the process of making soul-consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is Māyāvāda philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But still every moment we are body conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's it. But that is Māyāvāda philosophy, "Everything one. Everything one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Māyāvāda or no <span class="Italic">vāda,</span> this is a fact, that we are body conscious. We look to the facts, sir, we scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Rāmakrishna ate stool because he said, "Stool and <span class="Italic">prasādam </span>are one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? He ate stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Where does he say so?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> His disciple... One of his disciples told us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Disciple has said, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> As an experiment to show that it was all one, he said that he ate stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, of course, I do not know about stool, but he wanted to eat beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because he tried to worship God in the form of Muslims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he wanted permission from the proprietor of the temple. "Now I am going to experiment Mohammedan religion, so I want to eat beef." So he said frankly that "Now you have to go away, sir. I cannot allow this." Then he stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But he did not eat beef. He did not eat beef. He saw it and that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when the permission was not given by the proprietor he had no other way to stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Rasamaṇi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rasamaṇi. Rasamaṇi's husband.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She was a widow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, husband, no. Yes. His son-in-law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The son-in-law, Mathurā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So he experimented as a Christian, as a Muslim, and all, and he said he came to the same truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. That is rascaldom. He experimented means he was a fool. And a fool makes experiment, one who is fool. One who knows, why he should make experiment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Scientists do make experiments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are fools. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We don't make any experiment. We don't make any. We say, "Kṛṣṇa is God." That's all. No experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If, sir, Edison had not made experiment...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't say Christian and Hindus, Muslims. Anyone who is not a bhakta, he is a rascal. That's all. That is our conclusion.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmakrishna men say, "You worship any demigod, you go to God." Kṛṣṇa does not say. They say, "There are as many ways." And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekam. </span>They're all against <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> All against śāstra. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Did you know this <span class="Italic">bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram? Na hināsty ātmāna ātmānam tathāpy ātmā...</span> How shall you explain that, sir? <span class="Italic">Samaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu tiṣṭhantaṁ parameśvaram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ sarveṣu bhūteṣu</span> [Bg. 13.28]<span class="Italic">,</span> that I have explained so many times. If you see materially either dog or a big <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> the body is the same material. Body, when you dissect the body you find the same blood, same muscle, same bone. That's all. That is material. And spiritually they are <span class="Italic">atmān.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> From that point of view, from basic point of view. Not that he is seeing a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa </span>and dog equal. No. Not that. He is seeing the outward and inward. Inward is spirit. That is one. And outward, matter, that is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Another is <span class="Italic">śuni caiva śva-pāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the same thing, because he does not see the form; he sees the ingredients. Just like there are so many earthen pots, dolls. So any sane man knows that these are all made of earth. That's all. That vision is wanted, but these rascals, they are thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" "I am <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span>" "I am fat," "I am this," "I am that." Therefore they are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, we are prepared to think we are Americans, but they don't take us, unfortunately. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see? I may little digressing from this point. Before the India became freed we had an extremely high opinion about American race, American people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still I have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because... No, not people like us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is correct. Still I have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have got also. Because then it was American president who supported the freedom movement of India. But unfortunately Dulles spoiled the speech.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not speaking from that point of view. I see that the Americans, they have helped me in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You, but the whole India, they helped. It is only you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I feel obliged to them. Nobody helped me. These boys helped me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was your President Roosevelt, by whose action, I mean, Mr. Churchill began to lose his grip on India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this American government even, they never put any hindrance in my movement. They have, rather, appreciated. And many American old gentlemen came to congratulate me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because you are helping them, salvaging the boys from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, but they have helped me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are not smoking that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in 1962 in Geneva(?) only they helped, America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because that is a democracy. India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another thing, from material point of view... I am touring all over the world so many times. Materially nobody is as opulent as America, nobody. (sic:) Not even America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because the best brains of the world are drained there. That is the real cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Best brains of the world, they are attracted to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money, everyone is trying to get money in Bombay. But why there are (unclear)? It is... Unless one is destined to get money, he cannot get. It is not that, so cheap thing, that I want money; money will come. It is <span class="Italic">janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī [SB </span>1.8.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless one is pious he cannot get money, he cannot get education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇo yatra pārtho dhanur-dharaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So in that sense of materially,<span class="Italic"> janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī,</span> these four thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... [break] ...taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the greatest fortune. Thousands of young men joining, but here in India nobody is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they have already joined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All unfortunate, now they are. They have been so much trained badly. They say frankly, "Oh, this Hare Kṛṣṇa we have seen." In America when they chant... The Americans are chanting on the street, and the Indian students, "Oh, this we have done much. We have nothing to..." Here also they are thinking like that: "What is this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement? Eh? A beggars' movement."<span class="Italic"> śāstra </span>says,<span class="Italic"> harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">, </span>and these rascals are thinking, "Oh, Hare Kṛṣṇa we have seen." You see? They have become so greatly intelligent, these rascals. They do not believe in <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> in sādhu, in God. All these "incarnations" and big, big men, they say, "Oh, what is the use of <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span>" Even this Ānandamāyā says that "In higher advancement there is no need of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span>" He is above <span class="Italic">śāstra. </span>He, she says like that. And Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na sa siddhim avāpnoti</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">,</span> immediately condemned: "If you don't believe in <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> you are rascal." Kṛṣṇa said. And they say, "Oh, there is no need of..." And he's an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. This Bal-yogi rascal is doing that: "There is no need of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span>" This is going on. Now he's finished, of course. His activity is finished. [break]...strength of <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we are challenging that "You have never gone to the moon planet." Who can do so? The whole world is accepting they have gone to moon planet, and we are challenging, "You have never gone to moon." Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much. (end)</div>
