<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One, the origin of life, and the other, planetary system. There is no knowledge. They are simply speculating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rākṣana:</span> It is correct that the illumination of the moon is caused by the movement of the vegetation on the surface?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rākṣana:</span> So it should be fairly easy for scientists to prove, Svarūpa Dāmodara and such, that.... I know they can't prove there is illumination caused by the deserts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point. Therefore it is doubtful whether they have gone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Did they go to some other planet, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is different question. But they did not go to the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> you also explain that the moon is about 1,600,000 miles away, so they couldn't have gone. It's beyond the sun, you said, Prabhupāda? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...rectifying the senators and congressmen, is there much hope in talking to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The politicians in Washington. He would like to know if it's worthwhile talking to them, preaching to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Much hope talking to people like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes, I want to talk to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He wants to talk or you want to talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I want to talk to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I tried that, Srila Prabhupāda. It wasn't very successful. They're not serious. They shake hands and smile, but they don't want to talk any business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're so filled up with diplomacy anyway, it's impossible for them to understand anything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If "Hare" means energy of the Lord, what energy is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reply someone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Hare" refers to spiritual potency of Kṛṣṇa, Śrīmatī Rādhārānī. You can't approach Kṛṣṇa directly; you have to go by the mercy of Rādhārānī. So when you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa you're asking Śrīmatī Rādhārānī to engage you in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I heard on a tape, Srila Prabhupāda, you were talking about the same thing, and you happened to mention that Hare meant the energy of the Lord in terms of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and that we were calling upon to free us from her clutches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We call upon Kṛṣṇa to become free from <span class="Italic">māyā</span> because Kṛṣṇa is the master of <span class="Italic">māyā. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ [Bg. 9.10].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> (indistinct) can be cured by the chanting of the holy names of the Lord. But if it's necessary that the senses be controlled and the mind be controlled to understand spiritual subject matter, how is it that a person whose mind is completely out of his control, by chanting the holy name of the Lord can become spiritually advanced? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> We will go on ten thousands years and they are celebrating two hundred years' anniversary. Maybe they'll go on another hundred years, maybe. Already there is a big decline in their civilization. We are just coming alive, being born. We have a great future. For the Bicentennial they made a big cake five building stories high, and they brought it in big trucks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Big cake, birthday cake for America. And then the health department came and condemned it after people had been standing three, four hours in line to get a piece, because it had gone stale. [break]</div>
