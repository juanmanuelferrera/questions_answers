<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every father loves his son. Therefore this is contradictory. He is blind, but he has called... (microphone rattling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> He has no <span class="Italic">locana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he has called <span class="Italic">Padma-locana.</span> Similarly, this <span class="Italic">harijana</span> movement is a farce because they remain the <span class="Italic">Cāmāra</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhangis,</span> and still they are called <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> The same thing. No <span class="Italic">locana,</span> but <span class="Italic">padma-locana.</span> Everyone has got right. You can become the most advanced devotee. There is no hindrance. But they must be trained up as <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> Not that artificially you simply rubberstamp <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> Therefore that movement is failure. We have no objection to make anyone... Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">. Pāpa-yoni,</span> lower class. <span class="Italic">Janma-aiśvarya-śruta-śrī,</span> these four things, to take birth in high class family, <span class="Italic">janma, aiśvarya,</span> to become very rich, and <span class="Italic">śruta,</span> to become very learned scholar, and <span class="Italic">śrī,</span> beautiful, these four things are there whose background is pious life. Otherwise, not possible. <span class="Italic">Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrī [SB </span>1.8.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So those who are just the opposite-means not born in very high class family, not... They say "accident." No, it is not accident. According to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> <span class="Italic">karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> there is superior examination. Yamarāja is there. Now, this man is now dead, this soul is now changing body. What kind of body he'll get next? That is judged by the superior authority. Just like in the office a person is promoted. So his record is examined, how he has worked honestly to the interest of the establishment. All this consideration. Then he's given increment of salary or promotion to higher post. This is common sense. So it is not accident. A man is born from the very beginning, a rich man's son. That does not mean that it is accident. <span class="Italic">Daiva-netreṇa.</span> By a superior arrangement he is given the chance to take birth in a aristocratic family or rich family or educated family or in a beautiful family. There is... But this is, so far it is concerned, it is body, and our movement, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, is not of the body. Body is superfluous. It is spiritual movement. Kṛṣṇa therefore begins, <span class="Italic">asmin dehe, dehī.</span> This body is external. Just like dress. We are having this dress. I am not this dress. I am within the dress. Similarly, the spirit soul is within this body, and spiritual movement means about that spirit soul. Not of this body. So that spirit soul is completely different from this body and... Just like a gentleman is gentleman. One may have a different type of dress. Not that everyone is expected of the same dress. But within the dress, a gentleman is gentleman. Similarly, although there are so many varieties of bodies, within the body the soul is pure part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So the spiritual movement means to take up the spirit soul within the body and to elevate him from the conditioned life. That is spiritual movement. He has been put into condition. So that action can be taken without any hindrances. Without any impediment. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> That verse I was speaking yesterday, that without any cause, without any impediments, the soul can be raised by the process. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Never mind one is born in low class family, poor, ugly, uneducated family. It doesn't matter. But he can be raised. What is the process? <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya.</span> "One has to take shelter of Me." That is Kṛṣṇa conscious movement. We are giving equal chance everyone. It doesn't matter what he is. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ. Pāpa-yoni</span> means low class, poor, uneducated, ugly, no education. That is <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> So they can be raised. Kṛṣṇa says. How? <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya.</span> If he is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore it is the topmost welfare activities in the human society. Anyone can be raised. There are different grades of life all over the world. Some are black, some are white, some are ugly, some are poor. Varieties. Some are trees, some are plants, some are aquatics, some are birds, beasts, insects. Different varieties of life, 8,400,000. Some of them demigods, Brahmā, Indra, Candra. Very, very powerful. Just like this sun, that is also a planet, and the chief person is the sun-god Vivasvān. We get all this information. There is. These rascals, they do not know what are these planets, what are the arrangement. They are exactly like this planet. Just like here also, we have got president. It is expected, one president or one king in one planet. That was formerly. On this planet there was one king. The Pāṇḍavas, up to Mahārāja Parīkṣit. Five thousand years ago. One king of the whole world. One kingdom, one ruling, one culture, Vedic culture. Gradually we're losing... The culture is lost and anyone is doing as he likes. No king, no ruling. Therefore chaotic condition. Otherwise, according to God's plan, every planet there is one chief person ruling. So in the sun there is a person. His name is given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān.</span> His name is Vivasvān. And his son is Vaivasvata Manu. <span class="Italic">Vivasvān manave prāha.</span> These things are there. And his son, Ikṣvāku. And from Ikṣvāku, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya-vaṁśa...</span> In India still, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> are known, two dynasties, one from sun, one from the moon. <span class="Italic">Candra-vaṁśa,</span> <span class="Italic">Sūrya-vaṁśa.</span> Still, they are. So the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> are coming. One dynasty is coming from the sun, another... So moon is not desert. These are simply rascals. They do not know anything, and rascals believe that the moon is desert, and the sun is desert. Only this planet is full of variety and beauty. No. We have to take lessons from the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> So anyone can be raised to the highest platform. <span class="Italic">Caṇḍālo 'pi dvija-śreṣṭho hari-bhakti-parāyaṇa.(?)</span> Even one is born as <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla... Caṇḍāla</span> means less than the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> The dog-eaters. <span class="Italic">Caṇḍālas. Śva-paca.</span> They are called <span class="Italic">śva-paca. Śva</span> means dog and <span class="Italic">paca</span> means cooker. One who cooks the... There are still so many. In Korea, in China, in Hong Kong. They eat dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They consider it a delicacy. I had a German priest staying with me last year and he was telling me that he had wonderful soup. And when he found out what was the soup, he said, "Well, didn't you see the puppy that was going about this morning? It is soup of the same puppy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Hong Kong. Yes. In Hong Kong you won't find street dogs. They'll eat them. So in India also there are dog-eaters. In Assam you'll find. They make <span class="Italic">kukura-piṭhā. Kukura-piṭhā</span> means that first of all the dog is given to eat some rice preparation with <span class="Italic">gur</span> [Indian brown sugar]. And pushing, pushing. When he dies, then it is roasted. Then that is very good food. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Kukura-piṭhā.</span> The Assamese, they eat. There are different nations. <span class="Italic">Śva-paca,</span> this word is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini śuni caiva śva-pāke ca</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">śva-pāke</span> means this <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla.</span> One who eats a dog. <span class="Italic">Śva-pāke ca paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ.</span> So everyone can be raised to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no difficulty. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement. So from early in the morning He is teaching. <span class="Italic">Udilo aruṇa pūraba-bhāge dwija-maṇi gorā amani jāge.</span> He was not lazy. He was very busy. From early in the morning. So if we at least pretend to follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu, we cannot sleep. We must rise early in the morning. If you want to follow Caitanya Mahāprabhu, there is no question of sleeping in the morning. One must get up at least one and a half hours before the sunrise. That is <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati. Maṅgala-ārati</span> means to get up early in the morning, take your bath, and be prepared for the <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span> Then begin your chanting, prayer. This is activity. It is not... Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not a lazy life. It is not lazy life. All Kṛṣṇa conscious, Rāma conscious, they are very busy. To speak, even the Hanumān, Jambavān, Aṅgada, they are monkeys, still how they were busy, from the history we find, to serve Kṛṣṇa, Rāmacandra. Hare Kṛṣṇa. I was questioned by some gentleman sometimes in 1940. He charged that the Vaiṣṇava, "This Vaiṣṇava means a lazy fellow." He said like that. (laughs) So I said, "You have never seen a Vaiṣṇava." I told him, "You have never seen a Vaiṣṇava." "No, I have seen these Vaiṣṇavas. They do not do anything and taking <span class="Italic">mālā</span> and pretending to be very highly elevated and sleep and snore." That's... You have seen... "But you have not seen. You might have seen these pseudo-Vaiṣṇavas, but real Vaiṣṇava you have not seen." "What is that real Vaiṣṇava?" And I said that in India there were two big wars. One war was the Rāma-Rāvaṇa, and another war Kurukṣetra. So in these two wars, the hero is Vaiṣṇava. One is Hanumān and another is Arjuna. Have you seen them? Have you heard about them? Are they lazy fellows? Hanumān is Vaiṣṇava. He could raise one mountain and jump over the sea and set fire in the very beautiful state of Rāvaṇa. This is Vaiṣṇava. This is Vaiṣṇava. And Arjuna, he was in the beginning hesitating that "My cousin-brothers, the other side..." (end)</div>
