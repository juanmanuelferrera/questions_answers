<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This rascal theory has meant an atheist. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> ...<span class="Italic">mānava-sevā</span> say, "I don't have to support your society or your temple because God is everywhere."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also <span class="Italic">mānava-sevā.</span> We are giving this knowledge to the human society. Is it not <span class="Italic">sevā?</span> They are remaining in darkness of their position and we are giving them this knowledge. This is not <span class="Italic">sevā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> But what about the poor, hungry, and the suffering bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, poor, hungry, come. We can give you food. We are giving, already. Show the pictures. You have not seen the pictures of Māyāpura, how two thousand, three thousand people we are giving. That is included. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-sevā</span> includes that. You do not require to do it separately. It is already there. Just like if you pour water on the root, the watering the leaf is included. But if you water the leaf, then that tree will dry. And that is not complete. But if you pour water on the root of the tree, it is complete. Why don't you give this reason? This is natural. If you give food to the stomach, the service of the other parts of the body is included. But if you give food to the eyes, it is spoiled only. The food is spoiled, the eyes are spoiled, and nobody is satisfied. Why don't you give this reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> So in that way, because they are not feeding the stomach, they are actually starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Starving. They are supplying food to the eyes. The eyes are becoming blind and the food is wasted and no nutrition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> So by this kind of philosophy they are destroying themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is against their interest. These rascals, they do not know what is their interest. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you keep the stomach empty and try to supply food to the eyes and legs, it is simply waste of time. But these rascals, they do not know. They will go on committing mistakes after mistakes. This is the position. We are giving the real knowledge that "You serve in this way. Then everyone will be pleased." <span class="Italic">Kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> They are simply acting out of ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. So you are... We are delivering them from ignorance. (<span class="Italic">kīrtana-</span>break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...program in this life is birth, old age, disease and death. And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives the remedy for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is good. If you want to stop this repetition of birth, death, old age and disease, then you must take the way of life spoken by... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...seem to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is in healthy condition. (devotee offers obeisances-break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Just like a medicine... We may understand it. For myself, I can tell. I study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and I understand it, but I find so much difficulty to applicate it to the life of every day because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Everything is difficult but... Why "but"? (pause-break) ...a physician, to purchase the medicine, to drink the medi..., that is also difficult but we have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives the way to go back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> gives the way to go back to Godhead. Otherwise one has to suffer continuously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this material world, birth after birth. One birth, suffering, then again die, again another birth, again suffering. But the people are kept in ignorance. They do not know how the soul is transmigrating. (aside:) <span class="Italic">Ayi. Betiye.(?)</span> From... Ask them to sit down properly. Why don't you... Is there any seat, proper? So you... (Hindi) What was the topic? What was going on, the topic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning we went to this engagement. There was the inauguration of the Vivekananda Society Home, so we went there on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> because we were invited by them. And one swami spoke and he said service to mankind was also service to God. And at the end he also said that Vivekananda used to say that for the housewife, that the cooking pot was becoming God, had become God, had become a God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People applauded. This is foolishness. They do not know how to act. Just like if you pour water on the tree, then it is accepted that you are pouring water on the tree but that is not the process. The process is to pour water on the root of the tree. Practically we... You can make an experiment. Just like here is a tree. You don't pour water on the root but pour water on the leaves. Then it will dry in due course of time. It will not be effective. But if you pour water on the root, the water will go everywhere. So the whole thing is just like a tree. God is the origin of everything. He is the root. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore He is the root. So if you pour water in the root, then the water is distributed everywhere. But if you pour water on the leaves, on the twigs, on the fruits, it will take time and it will not be successful. So one who is not in awareness of the laws of nature, they commit this mistake. We can say that pouring water on the leaves is also pouring water on the tree. By serving human being you can serve the Supreme Lord, but that is not the way. Another example is that if you supply food to the stomach, then the share is partaken by all the parts of the body. But if you supply food to the part of the body, it is not shared by other part of the body. They are opening hospital for men, human being, but what about the animals? They are also part and parcel of God. They are killing them. So they have no realization of God. God says, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Suppose I have got several sons. If you take care of my one son and you neglect others I will not be happy, naturally. But if you take care of all my sons, then I'll be happy. For a father there is no such distinction that "My particular son should be taken care of and other should be neglected or they should be killed." That is not father's view. So if God is the father of all living entities, if you take simply care of the human being, then what of the others? There are so many fallacies in this argument, by taking care of the human being you worship God. There are so many fallacies. Hm? Is it not? So you have to put this argument, that "By serving human society is to serve God"-that is not fact. That may be partially; it is not complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, so he talked (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He didn't talk once about Kṛṣṇa. He didn't mention once the name of Kṛṣṇa, and he didn't say anything about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the root of everything. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So He is the root. So you pour water in the root. Just like we are Kṛṣṇa conscious. So because we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, does it mean that we are not taking care of the human being? That is automatically coming. But those who are taking care of the human society only, social work, political work, they do not know even what Kṛṣṇa. Missing. That is the difference. Because we are taking of Kṛṣṇa, we have come to the human society. We are teaching them Kṛṣṇa consciousness, spiritual knowledge. That is automatically. We are feeding them, giving them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That is included. But those who are opening hospitals for human being, they are taking the poor animals to the slaughterhouse, maintaining big, big slaughterhouse. That means foolishness. Kṛṣṇa will not be happy that one son you take care by opening hospital and another son you go, you send him to the slaughterhouse. This is foolishness. Never. God will never be happy. The same example. If the father has got both children-you take care one of them and others you kill them-will the father be happy? So that is not the way of making the supreme father, God, happy. That is not the way. That is foolish way. Rather, displeasing the father. That is not a very good philosophy. Why you should make distinction? He claims,</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>mūrtayaḥ sambhavanti yāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tāsāṁ brahma mahad yonir<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</i>:<i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7] "Every living entity is My part and parcel. Every living entity is begotten by Me. I am the father." So how you can make discrimination from one son to another? That is foolishness. You cannot expect by pleasing one son the father will be happy. But if you bring something to the father and pay him, or some food, "Sir, it is for your sons," then he'll be pleased. He'll distribute the foodstuff to his sons. But if you take care one of the sons and don't take care of the other son, the father will never please. Very... That is not the way of pleasing the father. That is foolishness. You may say that "I am taking care of the best son," but to a father, either the best son or the lowest son, the same. Father does not make any..., "Because this is best son, he should be satisfied and the worst sons should be neglect." Father does not make. Father will like better that "You take care of my worst son first." And besides that, to take care of the human society, it is also bogus. Nobody can take care. There are so many problems in the human society how you can take care? But the real problem is-that is for everyone-<span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span> Either he is animal or human being or demigod or big man or small man or rich man or poor man, a learned man, foolish man, these problems are there, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi.</span> So if you take care of these problems, how to save them, all of them, from these four problems, that is real service. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> Otherwise temporary-"I am hungry. You give me some relief"-but that relief is temporary. I'll become again hungry. And if I come to you twice, thrice, you'll be disgusted. Neither you can. There are so many hungry men. But if with a view to solve his all problems of life, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi,</span> if you take care of him, that is the best service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, also Lord Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> at the end that "One who surrenders to Me, he will be delivered from all material reactions and go to (indistinct)." But it is also said that some persons, they are more inclined to surrender than others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You should surrender; you should request others to surrender. That is service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it because of their <span class="Italic">karma,</span> past activity, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. One can immediately surrender if he likes. The background has nothing to do. Even the background is sinful, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "I shall save you from reaction of sinful life." Then there is no consideration of their background. You simply surrender. Then it will be solved, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, has anyone got the same ability to surrender, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has got. If I say, "You surrender," you just... What is... If you disagree, that is another. Otherwise you can surrender immediately. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So it's just by our personal whim that we can surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone can surrender immediately. There is no difficulty. But if he does not, then nobody can induce him. Otherwise, if he likes, he can surrender immediately. And He said, voluntary. Kṛṣṇa does not force. If He would have forced, then He would not say, "You surrender." No, it is your will. If you like, you surrender. If I say, "You do this," that is not force. If you like, you can do. That is your interest. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru: [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63] "Whatever you like, you do that. But I give you the right instruction, that if you surrender, you'll be happy." That is the greatest service. If you teach people how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, that is the greatest service. That will solve his all problems. (aside:) Dayānanda has... That's all. Bring water. If you don't surrender, then go on suffering. That's all. That is your business. You should surrender...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> I have got some doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If we are all children of Lord Kṛṣṇa-all the living beings are a part of Kṛṣṇa-in that case childrens in thousands and hundreds who are killed every day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is created by you, that you may become the sons of one father, but every one of you has got different tendency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But I can't see how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, just try to understand that we are all sons of Kṛṣṇa. That's nice. (aside:) No, there is another one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Of brass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is silver. You go. All right. A father has got five sons. Some of them are very learned; some of them are foolish. Why? Does the father like that "The some of my sons should be rascals, and others should be very nice?" Does the father like it? Then why he becomes? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If one becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) That we say. Consider. But these varieties are there, so how you can check it? Cause may be different. I have seen while I was in Allahabad one big barrister's sons. One became barrister; another became <span class="Italic">ekala.(?)</span> You know <span class="Italic">ekala? Ekala</span> driver. So the father did not like that "One of my sons should become <span class="Italic">ekala,</span> and other son should be like me, barrister," but I have seen. And there are many instances. The father does not want that "My son should be vagabond, useless," but sometimes they become by their own activities. That independence everyone has got. So that is not father's creation. Your point was "Why God has created like that?" That is foolishness. God says that you surrender." But you do not surrender. That is your foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (indistinct) ...must be punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Naturally. Suppose if there is some infectious disease, the doctor says, "Don't go there." And if you go there, you'll be infected. You'll suffer. How the doctor can protect you? Doctor's duty is to warn you not to go to that area, "It is now infected with smallpox." But in spite of doctor's instruction, if you go there and if you infect that disease and suffer, then it is your fault. When a man is hanged by the judgment of the court, do you think that the high-court judge is inimical to that person? He's giving judgment to other persons that "This one must make one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees from that person." And next judgment, "This man must be hanged." Does it mean the high-court judge is partial? He's simply giving judgment on the merit of the particular case. So there is no argument that "Why God has created so many varieties?" God has not created. You have created. Man is the architect of his own fortune. Fortune and misfortune you have created. So we have to suffer or so-called enjoy. There is no enjoyment here. It is simply suffering. But because you are under <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> you are thinking suffering as enjoying. Just like a hog is eating stool. Other man is becoming... "Very abominable!" Oh what nasty thing he is..." But he is enjoying. He is thinking, "I am enjoying the best food." I have seen in airplane. One Indian gentleman, he was eating the intestine of the hog. So it was horrible for me, but he was eating very nice. So in this way the world is going on. "One man's food is another man's poison." So similarly, we are creating our next birth according to our desire. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> According to the infection of the different modes of material nature, we are creating good or bad body next life. The laws of nature is unknown to the foolish society. They are thinking, "This life is everything. Misled, they do not know the aim of life. That is going on. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> One blind leader is leading other blind men. This is going on. And when we present the real solution, they say it is brainwash. Now against our movement there is propaganda in USA, charging that "He has brainwashed them." (aside:) You can come here. (Hindi) "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." This is our position. When we speak all these things, they say it is brainwashing movement. Actually it is brainwashing movement because we are dissipating all kinds of misunderstanding, values of life. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> It is not brainwashing; it is heart-washing. Our heart is stacked with so many dirty things, so we are trying to wash it. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.</span> And that is our movement. We are trying to cleanse the heart so that he can understand himself. One can understand his real position and then do the needful and life becomes successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Where is soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagad-guru:</span> He is asking where is the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you see? So soul is within the heart. When the soul goes away you cannot explain what happened. You say, "heart failure." So why the heart failure? The nerves and the bones and the muscle and the blood, everything is there, and still, you say that "It stopped. Heart failure." So just like machine is running but somehow or other stopped, but you do not know what is the cause of stopping. The cause is that the heart, when it goes away, then the machine stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> God is within the soul also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is along with you. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> He is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> Swamiji, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is telling <span class="Italic">karma</span> also and surrendering also. Now, how it is possible? In <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma,</span> if you do... Just like we are preaching so many people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa but will do not do. Do you think our, this instruction, that "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa," is taken by everyone? Do you think? Suppose you are all here. We are preaching the same thing, that "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." But these boys, they have surrendered, but you have not surrendered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all try to understand. It is... The free will is there. If you don't surrender, then, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ:</span> "Instead of sitting idly, better you do your prescribed duty." So the prescribed duty is <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> According to <span class="Italic">guṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> there are four divisions. So if you are in the first-class division as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> you do the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> work. If you are a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> you do the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's...</span> <span class="Italic">Niyataṁ kuru karma.</span> What is you are destined, you do that nicely. Don't be idle. That is Kṛṣṇa's in... But if you are intelligent, then Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> But you are foolish; then you be engaged in your prescribed duty. And if you are intelligent, then "You give up everything; simply surrender to Me." That depends on you. If you are intelligent, you'll surrender; if you are not intelligent, be engaged in your <span class="Italic">karma. </span>Kṛṣṇa is giving all facilities. Now it is up to you to make your selection. But he says, <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Verse">niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>karma jyāyo hy akarmaṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>śarīra-yātrāpi ca te<br class="calibre2"/>na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Should I read the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> "Perform your prescribed duties, for action is better than inaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you have no prescribed duties, then you are animal. Just like monkey. What is his duty? He is jumping simply and creating havoc. Monkey is very busy. Wherever he'll sit down, he'll "Gat, gat, gat, gat," like this. That's all. Very busy. But what is the meaning of his business? Simply creating disturbance Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma tvam:</span> "Act on your prescribed duties." Don't act like a monkey. That is better. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> "For action is better than inaction. A man cannot even maintain his physical body without work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Purport. "There are many pseudo-meditators who misrepresent themselves as belonging to high parentage, and great professional men who falsely pose that they have sacrificed everything for the sake of advancement in spiritual life. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not want Arjuna to become a pretender, but that he perform his prescribed duties as set for <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Arjuna was a householder and a military general, and therefore it was better for him to remain as such and perform his religious duties as prescribed for the householder <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Such activities gradually cleanse the heart..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are following? Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> "...and free him from material contamination. So-called renunciation for the purpose of maintenance is never approved by the Lord, nor by any religious scripture. After all, one has to maintain one's body and soul together by some work. Work should not be given up capriciously, without purification of materialistic propensities. Anyone who is in the material world is certainly possessed of the impure propensity for lording it over material nature, or, in other words, for sense gratification. Such polluted propensities have to be cleared. Without doing so, through prescribed duties, one should never attempt to become a so-called transcendentalist, renouncing work and living at the cost of others."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> "The Lord has given Arjuna confidential knowledge of the Supersoul within everyone's heart, and now he is giving the most confidential part of this knowledge: just surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

This essence is not understood by a common man, but by one who is actually very dear to Kṛṣṇa, a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. This is the most important instruction in all Vedic literature.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Guhyatamam,</span> most confidential.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Te hitam.</span> So it is not for all. One who is in confidence of Kṛṣṇa, a pure devotee, for him, not for the ordinary man. Ordinary man-"You do your prescribed duty." But they have no prescribed duty even. The people of this age, they are so fallen, they have no prescribed duty. They are simply engaged like animals-eating, sleeping, sex, and defense. That's all. Animal is engaged like that, eating, sleeping, sex, and defense. So we are being educated only like animals. We do not know the value of life, how nature is working, how we are changing our body. No education all over the world. Simply making plans how to eat, how to sleep, how to enjoy senses, how to defend, that's all. This is animal life. This is not prescribed duty. Prescribed duty is above this. From animal, one has to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> utmost, <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> like that. That is prescribed duty. And simply whole day working for eating, sleeping, mating, that is the business of the hog. Hog is also whole day working for eating, sleeping, and sex, and defense. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> You should not live the life of a hog, <span class="Italic">viḍ-bhujām. Viḍ-bhujām</span> means the stool eater. He is also working day and night. What is the business? "Where is stool?" That's all. And as soon as he's strong then, "Where is sex," without any discrimination. That is hog's life. So human life is not meant for spoiling like hog's life. Therefore <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma tvam.</span> You should classify yourself amongst the four divisions, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> and then your prescribed duties are there.

That is <span class="Italic">niyataṁ karma tvam.</span> Otherwise, jumping like monkeys, that is not <span class="Italic">karma.</span> That is monkey's dance. It has no value. Wasting time. You should not waste time, a single moment. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">niyataṁ kuru karma tvam.</span> So make that. Don't waste your time. That's all right. And she is child.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Kṛṣṇa says, you hear and do. Just like you are now acting, family conscious or country conscious or society conscious. The dog is also working as dog conscious. Monkey is working, monkey conscious. He is thinking, "I am monkey." You are thinking you are Indian. He is thinking he is American. He is thinking as..., so on, so on, different consciousness. But when you act Kṛṣṇa consciousness, that is your real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Now we are working under different consciousness, therefore varieties. And when you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it is oneness, perfection, to act according to the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> What Kṛṣṇa says, you act accordingly. You are acting... The Communists, they are acting Lenin consciousness. Is it not? Their god is Lenin. I have been in Moscow. Everywhere Lenin's picture, Lenin's book, and they are worshiping Lenin's tomb. That is Lenin consciousness. So similarly, you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5) (Indian man):</span> Those who have become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they will see Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, otherwise where is consciousness? If you do not think of Kṛṣṇa. Just like these boys. They are always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, either chanting or reading book or selling book or writing book, preaching Kṛṣṇa, twenty-four hours, taking Kṛṣṇa's prasādam, taking rest for working in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything in Kṛṣṇa, chanting always Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They have no other business.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think? We are all rascals, blindly following? Do you think like that? Then why I have not seen? Why do you ask this? If we are acting for Kṛṣṇa, do you mean to say that we are following blindly? Do you think like that? What is your opinion? If we have not seen Kṛṣṇa, then how we are acting for Kṛṣṇa? Hm? What is your idea? We are all fools, that without seeing the master we are acting? Do you think like that? Why don't you answer? This is foolish question.

<div class="After-Verse">"For one who sees Me everywhere and sees everything in Me, I am never lost, nor is he ever lost to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there a purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> "A person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness certainly sees Lord Kṛṣṇa everywhere, and he sees everything in Kṛṣṇa. Such a person may appear to see all separate manifestations of the material nature, but in each and every instance he is conscious of Kṛṣṇa, knowing that everything is the manifestation of Kṛṣṇa's energy. Nothing can exist without Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa is the Lord of everything-this is the basic principle of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the development of love of Kṛṣṇa-a position transcendental even to material liberation. It is the stage beyond self-realization at which the devotee becomes one with Kṛṣṇa in the sense that Kṛṣṇa becomes everything for the devotee, and the devotee becomes full in loving Kṛṣṇa. An intimate relationship between the Lord and the devotee then exists. In that stage, the living entity attains his immortality. Nor is the Personality of Godhead ever out of the sight of the devotee. To merge in Kṛṣṇa is spiritual annihilation. A devotee takes no such risk. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">."</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> " 'I worship the primeval Lord Govinda who is always seen by the devotee whose eyes are anointed with the pulp of love. He is seen in His eternal form of Śyāmasundara situated within the heart of the devotee.' At this stage Lord Kṛṣṇa never disappears from the sight of the devotee, nor does the devotee ever lose sight of the Lord. In the case of a yogi who sees the Lord as Paramātmā within the heart, the same applies. Such a yogi turns into a pure devotee and cannot bear to live for a moment without seeing the Lord within himself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are seeing also Kṛṣṇa, but because you have no love, therefore you cannot appreciate how we are seeing. If you love some person you keep his photograph on the breast. Is it not? So you are seeing Kṛṣṇa in the temple, but because you have no love you think that "I am not seeing Him." That is the defect. They are seeing Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise why they have sacrificed everything for worshiping Kṛṣṇa, for dressing Kṛṣṇa, for feeding Kṛṣṇa? They are seeing Kṛṣṇa. They are not wasting their time. But you have no love for Kṛṣṇa. You're thinking that "They have not seen Kṛṣṇa. They are worshiping an idol." That is the difference. One who loves somebody he keeps his picture on his chest. He does not? He throws it, same picture. It is question of love. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has developed that love and <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> he can see Kṛṣṇa at every moment. Otherwise it is not possible. And because you cannot see, you ask them also, "Can you see?" But the seeing process is different. We do not know the process; therefore we are thinking that Kṛṣṇa cannot be seen. And one who knows the process, he sees every moment. Is it clear? You learn the process; you will see Kṛṣṇa every moment. Therefore this word is used, <span class="Italic">premāñjana-cchurita.</span> By the eye ointment of love you have to smear your eyes; then you'll be able to see Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ.</span> When one's eyes is covered by the <span class="Italic">yoga-māyā</span> he cannot see, see Kṛṣṇa.</div>

That is your fault. You go to the wrong person, and you are cheated because you want to be cheated. You want to see magic; you don't want to see God. God is personally speaking, accepted God, not that by magical... And who can show greater magic than Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa, when He was seven years old, He lifted the Govardhana Hill. Can this rascal do that? Who can be greater magician than Kṛṣṇa? So we shall go to the greatest magician. Why shall I go to a tiny magician? That is our misfortune. If you want to see magic, see the magic, what Kṛṣṇa has done. This is our misfortune, that we go to a wrong person and misled. If you want magician, see Kṛṣṇa, how great magician He is. He married sixteen thousand wives. Is there any instance in the history of the world that one has sixteen thousand wives and maintaining each of them? And he expanded himself in sixteen thousand husbands. Not that one wife is waiting: "When sixteen thousand, after sixteen thousand nights, He would come here?" No. He is present everywhere. That is magic. Nārada was surprised that "How Kṛṣṇa is maintaining sixteen thousand wives?" He saw in each and every home sixteen thousand establishment and Kṛṣṇa is present everywhere. So this is magic. Why don't you see Kṛṣṇa's magic? Why you are so much allured by a tiny magician? That is your misfortune. Poor heart, poor magic. See the real magic. If you want to see magic, see the Kṛṣṇa's magic. Kṛṣṇa, when He was three months old, the Pūtanā came to kill the child by poisoning but she was killed. So in this way, from the very beginning of Kṛṣṇa's appearance, He's killing so many demons. So why don't you see this magic? If you want to see magic, see Kṛṣṇa's magic. Why the poor magic? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-loka-maheśvaram: [Bg. </span>5.29] "I am the proprietor of all the <span class="Italic">lokas</span>." And each <span class="Italic">loka...</span> Suppose this <span class="Italic">loka,</span> earthly planet. There are hundreds of gold mines. Why you are captivated with the <span class="Italic">chaṭāka</span> gold? Why don't you be captivated by the person who has millions of gold mines by His wish? So we are poor; therefore we are captivated by poor magician. If we are intelligent, then we should be captivated by Kṛṣṇa's magic. That is intelligence. But we are poor; we are captivated by poor magic. That's all. Don't be poor. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> Don't remain <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Then your life will be successful.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But first thing is that why do you want immediately effect? That is foolishness. The effect will be there. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">dhairya. Utsāhād dhairyāt. Dhairya</span> means patience. You act God acting with patience. The result will be <span class="Italic">niścaya.</span> The result will be there. These things are required. <span class="Italic">Utsāhād dhairyāt niścayāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt, sato vṛtteḥ sādhu-saṅge ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.</span> So why you should have a foolish person-"Now I come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I have become immediately everything. Give up everything?" Why do you think like this? The same example: The girl is married, now it is sure that she'll have child. Wait. <span class="Italic">Niścaya.</span> When there is husband and wife there will be child. There is no doubt about it, but wait. Why do you expect immediately child on the day of marriage. This is foolishness. So you should answer these rascals like that. "You cannot expect immediately. But we are on the path. We have just entered." One enters into the school. Does it mean in one year or six months he becomes MA? He has to wait. But he has entered the school. There is expectation of his passing MA examination. But one who has not entered school, loitering in the street, he has no... He's hopeless. But this man has hope. Wait. The same example: If one girl is not married, then where is the question of child? Everything has to wait. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">utsāhād dhairyāt.</span> One should have proper enthusiasm and patience. That is wanted. How one foolishly expects the result immediately? You sow the seed; you water it; it grows; then it becomes big tree; then pick the fruit; then eat. Immediately you cannot expect. Immediately you have got. As soon as you get the seed, you have got the thing, undoubtedly. But you must give time the seed to fructify. That required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What exists between the planet Gokula and the (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a planet who is full of cows, Gokula. That's it. <span class="Italic">Surabhīr abhipālayantam. Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu surabhīr abhipālayantam [Bs. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is engaged there in tending cows, <span class="Italic">surabhī</span> cows. That is Gokula. That planet is full of cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What I mean to say is what exists between any two of the planets of Śrī Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What exists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In the two abodes of the plenary expansion of Kṛṣṇa. What exists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plenary? Yes, Kṛṣṇa is expanding millions and millions forms. <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta-rūpam ādyaṁ purāṇa-puruṣaṁ nava-yauvanaṁ ca [Bs. </span>5.33]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe arjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> He is expanded, and He's living in your heart, my heart, ant's heart, everyone's heart. These are expansions, Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9) (Indian man):</span> Sir, his point is what exists between the planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This intervening medium?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you do not know the outer space? Outer space? The space is there. Just this planet, sun planet, there is space between... You do not know this? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do you mean to say there is no space between His planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean to say. Now you mean to say also. You do not know there is space difference between one planet to another?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Unless it is bounded by space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever it may be, there is difference. Just like you are existing. I am existing. There is space. So what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, but actually it is beyond space and time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Spiritual planets, he means to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They are beyond space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> They are beyond time and space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what does he mean? What does he mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> What is your point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is that... You can explain in this way, that <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is in the Goloka planet which is far, far away from our planet, but still He is everywhere. That is the difference. That you cannot imagine. In our material knowledge you cannot imagine that. But that is the fact. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati, tad aham aśnāmi: [</span>Bg. 9.26] "Anyone offering Me in devotion <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam,</span> I eat." Now, Kṛṣṇa is living far, far away in the Goloka planet. How He can eat? That is your imagining. But Kṛṣṇa says, "Yes, I do." That is Kṛṣṇa. Although He is far, far away, He is within your heart. That you cannot imagine, how it is possible. That is your material knowledge. But you have to accept from the statement of <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that although He is far, far away, within your heart. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-para...</span> He is within the atom also. So that you cannot imagine. That requires a different knowledge, Vedic knowledge. The material knowledge will not help you, but you cannot imagine. You have to accept Vedic knowledge. What is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that you have to accept. That's all. Otherwise there is no possibility. Therefore to understand Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's activities you have to learn from Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You cannot manufacture your knowledge. That is not... Because you are defective-your senses are imperfect-so whatever knowledge you get through your senses, that is all imperfect. You cannot get perfect knowledge by your imperfect senses. That is not possible. Therefore the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> In order to learn that transcendental science you have to approach a guru who knows it.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is a different phase of knowledge. By your material calculation it will be difficult. The same thing, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aśnāmi:</span> "I eat." So Kṛṣṇa is far, far away. How does He eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is said there that holy planets is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says? Who says? Who is the sayer? An imperfect person, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, it is in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> That's what I am saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That holy planets exist between the lotus stem that's sprouting from navel of Kṛṣṇa. But there are many planets, millions of planets...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That is all explained there. <span class="Italic">Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ [Bs. </span>5.48]<span class="Italic">. Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya.</span> The Mahā-Viṣṇu's breathing and with the breathing innumerable planets are coming, <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍas</span> are coming out. <span class="Italic">Yasya eka niśvasita-kālam atha avalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ. Jagad-aṇḍa</span> means universe, and <span class="Italic">jagad-aṇḍa-nāthaḥ</span> means Brahmā. Millions of Brahmās living within the breathing period of Mahā-Viṣṇu. So we have to accept this Vedic knowledge. You cannot compare with your limited knowledge. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> His argument is that everything is bound by space.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, space is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, it's in the pits of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Space. Space grows, Brahman. <span class="Italic">Bṛhatvād bṛhannatvāt.(?)</span> Brahman means the greatest. The space is considered to be the greatest. So it is not only greatest but it is expanding more and more. It is becoming greater and greater. Just like some children. They made some foam, soap. It becomes bigger, bigger, bigger. It is like that. It comes from the breathing period but as soon as come out it becomes bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger. That is <span class="Italic">bṛhatvād bṛhannatvāt,</span> Brahman, the greatest. A small seed of banyan tree, very small, you cannot... It becomes bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger, and so big tree. It is... You see daily how it is coming. Can you make such seed, you scientist? Can you make? Then? Why do you compare your poor knowledge with Kṛṣṇa's knowledge? That is your poor fund of knowledge. You are thinking that "Kṛṣṇa may be like me." You can just compare the small banyan tree seed, just like a mustard seed, and it contains such a big tree, not only big tree, millions of seeds also, containing another millions of big trees. Can you make such seed? Hm? You scientists, can you make? You tell me. Can you prepare that seed? Then what you are scientists? See Kṛṣṇa's science. Don't compare yourself with Kṛṣṇa's science even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, one thing, if you say Goloka is infinite we should be existing within Gokula. How is it that we are without Gokula?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are within Kṛṣṇa; therefore you are within Gokula.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa is within us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Kṛṣṇa is without. That is Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">antar bahiḥ. Antar bahiḥ.</span> Kuntī says in her prayers that "Kṛṣṇa, You are <span class="Italic">antar bahiḥ.</span> Still, people cannot understand. You are... Without, You are existing, and within, You are..." Still, they are so rascal, they cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Antar bahiḥ.</span> Kṛṣṇa is without, Kṛṣṇa is within, but they cannot see. That is their misfortune. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is within the <span class="Italic">paramāṇu,</span> atom. Can you find out Kṛṣṇa? He says, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd... [Bg. 18.61].</span> He is within your heart. Can you find out? Then where is your science? It is already indicated that He is here. Find out. How you can find out? The dimension of the soul is given, one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair. The tip of the hair, you divide into ten thousand parts and that one part is the dimension of the soul. How can you find out? <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca jīvo bhāgaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is written there. Now you find out the measurement. You cannot find out measurement of the tip of the hair. And you have to divide into ten thousand parts. Then the measurement of the soul will come. So how can you do it? But they are described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> So go and see <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> (end)</div>
