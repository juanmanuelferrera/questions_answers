<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can give you formula. That toothpaste formula, that is my invention. It's working very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Can we have it? What if we can't find <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can supply <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves from India, any amount, from Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Nim</span> leaves from Vṛndāvana is unique, nobody can imitate us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Nim</span> leaves we can export from India. In the United Provinces there is ample <span class="Italic">nim</span> trees. That time I shall give you instruction also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We will start, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This is better than..., this is easier than restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you consider amongst yourselves. I have no difficulty, I have given direction, "Do like that." Now what you'll do, that is up to you. So far giving help and directions, that you will get perfect, there is no doubt about it. That you will get. How to manage, how to get ingredients, everything you'll get. Because I have to say only, you have to do. That's all. So that will be all right. Now decide. That will be very nice or very effective. Whatever we shall prepare, it will be very effective. So if there is market, why not? Introduce. I think there will be market because this country is undeveloped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We will manage it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There will be plenty of market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We require all these things. The more they become civilized, the more they require medicine and all these things. So you decide. I am so far giving instruction and help, and that will be available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We have been, Śrīla Prabhupāda, talking and thinking about it amongst ourselves, that now that we have this propensity to be in business, instead of working for <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> we should have our own business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So it's much better... If devotees are in charge, then the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> can work for us and they can become devotees. But if the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are in charge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are. Our society, it is not that we are simply <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> We have got <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> we have got <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> So <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> should be provided with some profession, business, so that they can earn very nicely. That is good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He has so much propensity to become engaged in these things, I have the propensity, all the devotees have the propensity. We can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you make your formula, I mean to say, plan and scheme. So far how to do it, that instruction I give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Now in this house you will see, this house, the plan is that the house, the first floor will be kitchen, restaurant and a store. A little section for store. Store will have Your Divine Grace's books, records, tapes, <span class="Italic">japa-mālā</span> and some sweets, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> that is made to go, to sell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who made <span class="Italic">sandeśa?</span> It was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nava-yauvana's wife, Mañjarī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, she can make <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> And some of these products also can be stocked there. Once we start and it is successful, then we can grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows how to make <span class="Italic">kacuri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> You like him to stay here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't say, but he can give you instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So if you will give us the formulas, we can learn from him the formulas for toothpaste?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> For toothpaste and what else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You remember it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Hm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, exactly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But toothpaste, you require collapsible tube.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It was better in the bottles. In a tube it just doesn't come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that will come out. The powder must be made very fine. Otherwise, it will not come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If it's pulverized with a machine it comes out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, if there's a machine it would be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very fine powder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> What about if we served it in a different shape. Tube is common. If we make it a little different it would be more attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to think, how it will be attractive here. Otherwise paste, put into the collapsible tube, then it becomes complete. The formula is there and everything. You don't take... Simply it has to be made very fine pulverized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And it lasts for a long time, because the toothpaste Prabhupāda is using now I made in last December, last December.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Are you happy with it, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Is it good? He made it good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. No, it was not made good because... It is not his fault, the powder was not very fine. But it will be better, nice, when the powders are very, very finely pulverized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> What other products do you recommend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you want me I shall give you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The one on leg that you put that <span class="Italic">nim</span> oil. That cleared up that cut in two days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Where is that <span class="Italic">nim</span> ointment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He was in a car accident in Mauritius, and he had a big cut on his leg, and when Prabhupāda invented this medicine, cured it in two days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any cut, any ulcer, it is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Even for ulcer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Oh, cut, ulceration, cut. How much royalty do we pay you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's gone a little moldy on the top again. Underneath it's all right, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we shall do it nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This looks different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> What is this, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Salt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is simply <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Nim</span> leaf boiled in <span class="Italic">ghee.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is not the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was not properly done. I asked Pālikā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It was very good that other time. It was completely merged in the <span class="Italic">ghee</span> and it was very nice. I cooked it for three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The water portion should be abolished. Then it will go not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> If the water portion is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Abolished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The secret is cooking it for a long time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, yes, of course, it should be dry. Then it won't go bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the water portion remains, it will decompose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Do you have to use <span class="Italic">ghee?</span> Can't we use some oil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, you can use vaseline. <span class="Italic">Ghee</span> is better, but vaseline you can use. Vaseline is available, I think you are not manufacturing vaseline?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, Iran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because vaseline is one of the by-products of petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have olive oil here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No olive oil. Vaseline will be very cheap here. And you can, if you want to engage him, if he wants to do something, that Praṇava, let him supply <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves, dry, from Vṛndāvana. If he actually wants some money, let him do some business. Let him collect all <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves and give him twenty percent profit. Suppose he collects <span class="Italic">nim,</span> collects and dry, and then packs it and dispatch. The cost of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The cost of dispatching, we give him twenty percent for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some arrangement he may make some profit. Honest business. Not that by cheating get something. That is not good. If he wants money, let him take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Have you had your massage, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'll come back and do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to leave soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We have to leave soon, in fifteen minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can go. Or you can leave ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So we can get ready to go. And we can get these formulas from you later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We will like that very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them be engaged in different ways and earn some money. This incense I taught Gargamuni first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, this is better than incense. You teach us the incense also, everything. We will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incense, I first of all taught Gargamuni, the starting was there in New York. Do you know that? And now it has developed very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The largest in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So, Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like us to... We have, this temple has some <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā</span> for you. How would you like me to do it? Today is Thursday. Would you like it in what form? Would you like us to invest it for you here, or give you the cash?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you give me the interest, eighteen percent, I'll utilize it for Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> I shall... Yes, that's fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, purchase one small book, like passbook. So you become my banker, I deposit with you. You receive it and send the interest, that's all. I make you banker. That's all. There is no botheration. You become banker, you send the interest. Now how you are utilizing, you know, I don't bother. But if I get the interest, then I think it is all right. What is it? Is it all right? Simple? So just purchase one small passbook. And... You have got that passbook? Or you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, I know. I shall do it. I will do it. We will put in this bankbook, your account, two thousand dollars now, today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I'll give you some foreign exchange, give him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India or America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because America is cheaper, because if I send it to India, if small amounts go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you send to America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> To America is all right? I send it every month to Rāmeśvara.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It took two weeks to make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two weeks? Why? Because the ingredients were not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, because your mustard oil, no one liked to taste it, and then you changed it to mustard seeds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mustard seed also can be exported from India. In the Mathurā district there is sufficient mustard seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yellow mustard seeds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mustard seeds and instead of chalk powder we mix <span class="Italic">nim</span> powder. Mustard seed, <span class="Italic">nim</span> powder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Calcium carbonate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And salt. Calcium carbonate means...? Oh, calcium, instead of calcium carbonate, let it be <span class="Italic">nim.</span> It will be very effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think the taste will be horrible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, taste will be... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No one will use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I saw they make this other toothpaste with sucrose. The second biggest ingredient is sucrose on the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> toothpaste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sucrose? What is that sucrose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Sucrose, you know, sucrose and glucose and lactose, those sugars. They use sugar powder, sucrose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, sucrose, yes. Saccharin and sucrose. Saccharin is sugar product.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We tried that too the first time, with those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That was not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salt is available very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And they use hard soap powder in these powdered ones. We tried that first with the hard soap powder? They use that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is it (indistinct), we shouldn't do it. Only simple three things, that's all. That is good. That has come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Menthol, pine oil, camphor, oil of wintergreen, glycerin, mustard powder, powdered salt and calcium carbonate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Good memory, yes, these are the things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You put all that in the last batch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Durban, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Bombay we made the last one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, that big batch last I made in Sanand. When you went to that Sanand above Ahmedabad, where that king had his palace, we stayed in that palace. That's when I made that big batch. But first it was developed in Durban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Durban, yes. Because there was no possibility of using (indistinct-word for stick toothbrush). My teeth broken, and it became painful, it was not working. Therefore I invented. But it is effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You said on account of this toothpaste... Your teeth were so rotten they want to fall out, but the toothpaste won't allow them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, actually my teeth have gone all bad. It is useless. But on account of this toothpaste it is still working. (laughs) Otherwise, according to dental science, it has to be extracted. It is no other remedy. If you go to a dentist, immediately he will say, "Extract all this and have a new set, artificial." That is, I know that. But I don't want to extract. As far as possible, use them and let them fall out automatically, as they have already fallen out so many. Fifty percent already fallen out, and twenty-five percent are shaking, and still I am eating. Otherwise, according to the dental science, I should not eat any salt. In Bengal there is a word that when teeth is rot, then your eating is gone. You cannot digest, you cannot eat. It is not... If the foodstuff is not properly chewed, it causes digestive disturbance. And digestive disturbance means so many diseases. This coughing is due to digestive disturbance. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's because liver's not working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes. It is old man's disease. Liver doesn't work nicely, teeth does not work nicely, there is susceptibility to cold. Old age. All my young friends, they have all died. Nobody's living. One or two still. You know that Dinanath came? I think you know. He's living. He's seventy-five, seventy-six. Little younger than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Who's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Dinanath Mishra in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One man, a case pleader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That very thin man? Oh, I know. Yes. He was very sick actually when we were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was sick. He was half dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What about those people when we went back to where you used to live? When we came back from Māyāpura and we went out that night to, what they called? Your old friend's house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Mulliks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Mulliks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are just like my younger brothers. Their elder brothers were contemporaries. They are all died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are younger. They are all my childhood playmates. Their older brothers, the eldest one was my very, very intimate friend, Siddheshvar Mullik. We used to ride on the same perambulator when we were three, four years old. And <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā</span> ceremony was performed with all these guests. They were about, in our neighborhood there were four, five houses. So all the children of the same age, I was the leader. (laughs) Yes. I organized this <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā.</span> I was performing <span class="Italic">Rādhāṣṭamī</span> and <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī,</span> and I was learning how to dress the Rādhā-Govinda. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You used to go in and dress Them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is, actually, it was our house. Just three, four house after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Rādhā-Govinda were the only Deities in the neighborhood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, only Deity, yes. And Rādhā-Govinda has big property. In front of the Deity house there is a very big building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just across the road? That one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just opposite. That is His building. Very good income. Besides that, He has many other lands. They have got very good income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're very well looked after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They're one of the oldest aristocratic families of Calcutta, Mulliks. The whole, from Howrah Bridge up to that street, all belongs to their property. Very rich men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now they don't own so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Deity has got income. So they have got terms for worshiping the Deity. So one who gets the term for worshiping, he takes the income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, in the family members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but practically that is now their income. The more one gets the worshiping term longer, he gets more income. (laughs) The Deity has got very, very good income. All the temples in India... Just like I am trying to make some fund for Vṛndāvana and Māyāpura. Even no contribution comes, it will go on. The <span class="Italic">sevā-pūjā</span> will not stop for want of money. So there will be no want of money. Still, I must make some provision, by the income the <span class="Italic">sevā-pūjā</span> will go on. Contribution may come or not. That provision should be made. Now in Vṛndāvana Akṣayānanda is collecting in so many ways. Suppose nobody collects. That does not mean this temple will be closed. It must go on. So I am trying to make some provision from that bank interest. At least five to ten thousand rupees so that the Deity worship will not be stopped. That is the system in all Indian temples. It must go on, <span class="Italic">nitya-sevā.</span> It must go on. These big, big temple in Vṛndāvana, they have got such arrangement. Otherwise how it is going on for five hundred, six hundred years? They have very good income. Govindajī has got eighteen thousand rupees monthly income. That is... He's the richest Deity in Vṛndāvana. And Raṅganātha is tenant of Govindajī. Land is taken from Govindajī, and Raṅganātha's temple is constructed. The Raṅganātha's temple management pays the rent. So Govindajī is the landlord and Raṅganāthajī is tenant. Raṅganāthajī is Rāmānuja-<span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> Govindajī is Gauḍīya-<span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> (laughter) So Rāmānuja-<span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> is the tenant of Gauḍīya-<span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> [break] No, as many as we want. Why? (end)</div>
