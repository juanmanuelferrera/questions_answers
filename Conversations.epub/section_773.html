<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Viśvanātha Cakravartī has discussed. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so easy: <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,</span> four principles. Why people do not take to it? Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He just wanted to know if someone was allowed to come for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let them come. This time, five to seven? (conchshell sounds) (Bengali) [break] <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavata-dharma</span> is for the person who is not jealous. <span class="Italic">Paramo nirmatśarāṇāṁ [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> This very word is used in the beginning, that "This <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> is meant for persons who is not jealous." Otherwise the material, whole world is full of jealousy. Even during the time of Kṛṣṇa there was Paundra, out of jealousy. And there were so many. Beginning from Kṛṣṇa's birth the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> were jealous-"How to kill Kṛṣṇa." This is the whole mat.... Even in the higher planetary system the jealousy is there, <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and the <span class="Italic">devas, devasura.</span> So our business is, as instructed by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā.</span> This jealousy will go on. Therefore one has to learn how to tolerate jealousy. <span class="Italic">Kīrtaniyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one wants to push on this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement.... Prabhupāda.... We are insignificant creature. So many persons. You cannot avoid it. The best way is to learn how to tolerate. That is very nice. Otherwise Caitanya Mahāprabhu not have said, <span class="Italic">taror api sahiṣṇunā.</span> That is the best. So we are not like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, neither like Prabhupāda, and we shall have to learn to tolerate. (Bengali) It is clearly written in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> that <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa śakti vinā nāhe kṛṣṇa nāma pracāraṇa.</span> Even they have no common sense, what can be done? No, no, this formula, that this is something new in the history of the world, and still they are jealous, what is this? They are finding fault. In Vṛndāvana, Nṛsiṁha-vallabha Gosvāmī, you know? He comes to me. He says, "So many people are jealous upon you." I say that first of all you create something like me. Then you become jealous. (Bengali) First of all let them become like me. Then.... (Bengali) The superior, he will dictate. And <span class="Italic">yei,</span> equal, they will live like friends. And those who are junior, they should follow and obey. This is the <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava niyama.</span> So those who are neither equal nor higher, how they can dictate? That is their mistake. Either first of all become higher than him-then you dictate-or you be equal with him-then you suggest. You are lower and you want to dictate? What is this nonsense? (Bengali) By standard, one who is lower, they want to dictate. (Bengali) (loud conchshell) <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. They may be very big visioner. (Bengali) A <span class="Italic">pakkā</span> Vaiṣṇava like you, to find out faults, what is this? Rādhārāṇī is.... (Bengali) They have not united. They have disunited. And here, practically you see all religions, all nations, all persons, all philosophy. Everything is there. (Bengali) They have come with their life. (Bengali) C.I.A. (Bengali) Less common sense they have. They haven't got even common sense. [break] ...on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, so all the money should be given to us. The money actually belongs to Kṛṣṇa. You, by tricks you are holding it. (knock) Yes? <span class="Italic">Āsana.</span> Open this. Open. (break-to morning walk)</div>
