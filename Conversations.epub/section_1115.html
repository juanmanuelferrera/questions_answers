<div class="After-Verse">(Hindi with guests) (aside:) There is some cardamom? [break] Everyone is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa's service-the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha, sannyāsī, brahmacārī.</span> That is external. And actual everyone is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and they have no other business than to serve Kṛṣṇa, if they are actually seriously doing. More than <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.

Anāśritaḥ karma.</span> Nothing for personal interest. Then you'll be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> As soon as you become covered with some personal desire or endeavor for personal satisfaction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing is his personal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...then you become designated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is conditioned. The Vṛndāvana life means the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> the cowherd boys, the cowherdsmen, the elderly men, Nanda Mahārāja, Yaśodārāṇī, his (her) status, every-cows, calves, trees, flowers, Yamunā-everyone is dedicated to Kṛṣṇa. That is the Vṛndāvana. They have no other business. That is Vṛndāvana. Everywhere, the whole description of the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, center is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book's so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vṛndāvana life, either in <span class="Italic">rasa</span> dance or the cowherd's play or killing the demons or in dining and dancing. The friends are eating, they are being stolen by Brahmā-but the center is Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. All activities are going on, just like in other place. But here in Vṛndāvana, all activities centered around Kṛṣṇa. When Brahmā is stealing His friends, the center is Kṛṣṇa. The demon is coming to destroy-the center is Kṛṣṇa. When there is forest fire, the center is Kṛṣṇa. This is Vṛndāvana beauty. In happiness, in danger, in perplexities, in friendship-everything Kṛṣṇa. Kāliya-damana. "Oh, Kṛṣṇa has gone to Yamunā. He has fallen down in the..., to fight the Kāliya." It is a very, what is called, calamity. But still, the center is Kṛṣṇa. This is the beauty of Vṛndāvana. "Kṛṣṇa has entered Yamunā to fight with Kāliya." It is not at all good news for mother Yaśodā, Nanda, friends and family, not at all. Their life is lost. But still the Kṛṣṇa is center. This is Vṛndāvana life. In everything Kṛṣṇa is center, anything. We are having just like: "Kṛṣṇa's a bad propaganda," opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Somehow or other, Kṛṣṇa's in the center. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am happy that Kṛṣṇa is center. That's all. This is the beauty of this movement. Although we are put into some difficulty, but center is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The difficulty actually is increasing our thinking of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The papers are publishing, "Kṛṣṇas, they are bad. They are so on, so on, so on." That's all right. Kṛṣṇa is center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, what you said this afternoon... Actually, I found out, one of the arguments that they're using... These deprogrammers, they're very clever. They've done a lot of research, because they're using that statement of Dr. Radhakrishnan's in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> where he says that <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto,</span> "Kṛṣṇa does not mean think of Him," they're using that against us to say that "This man Radhakrishnan was the president of India, and he says that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not meant for thinking of Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how much great harm he has done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. So now they're trying to use that to say that we are misinterpreting the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we don't say Radhakrishnan is authority. We take Caitanya Mahāprabhu as authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now we have to prove now that Radhakrishnan was not an authority on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is not in the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. You talk with Rāmeśvara like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, by using the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we can defeat their argument very easily anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I've defended in every page, that "These rascals have used this." Where is Rāmeśvara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Coming. Śrīla Prabhupāda, we've been talking about... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I shave once a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Once a month on <span class="Italic">pūrṇimā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And our Ādi-keśava, he has also grown out his hair for the court case and all the people. He's meeting the politicians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But we are famous as shaven-headed. That is already advertised. Shaven-headed means Kṛṣṇas. So why should we relinquish this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Trademark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It has made us famous. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes, it means a monk. In the Far East at least, shaven head means monk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Shaven-headed. These Buddhist monks, they are shaven-headed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even in the West they shave their heads. And they look something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, there was some income tax office pleader. So I have given the idea that "The fifty percent, that is promotion expenditure." So he accept..., "Yes, it can be done." Where is the profit? Whatever is profit is promotion expenditure. We give to ISKCON commission, or some way or other, it is spent. So he admitted, "Yes, it can be done." And last night I was suggesting, "For promotion spend." Even if we open a temple, that is promotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Profit means that people are putting money in their pocket and enjoying. And we don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we're not. No. If we open a center, that is propaganda center. Why do you say "temple"? But this is the way of propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Opening a new branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is promotion for the books. Whatever we do, it is promotion. That's all. And the main point is that it is not profitable, er profit concern, because you are not giving any royalty to the author. So where is his profit-making? Nobody's making profit-the author, the worker, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. So all expenditure-promotion, that's all. The cost of paper, cost of printing, cost of promotion-finished everything. Make account like that. The income tax father will not touch it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything we're doing is propaganda work, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. If still there is excess, give some bonus to the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas bhaktas.</span> They're family men. Let them have some expenditure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Some wage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Finished all... No account. So they admitted, both of them, "Yes, sir, that is... That can be done."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> You're a genius.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) And our Gopāla, he is going three times and to-"How to do it?" Do it like that. Everything spend for promotion. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> No money. And actually, that is the fact. Where is the profit, and who is going to take the profit? Nobody is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We're not opening our temples for a comfortable place to live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Sleep on the floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's no sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was explaining, that what is Vṛndāvana life. In Vṛndāvana life there is everything-the cowherds boy, the calves, the cows, the elderly person like Nanda Mahārāja, Yaśodāmayī, friend. What is their aim? The aim is Kṛṣṇa. The demons... (laughter) Everything is Kṛṣṇa. The demon is coming there. That is also... Center is Kṛṣṇa. And <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are dancing. That is also... Center is Kṛṣṇa. And Brahmā is stealing the friends and cows. That is also center Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Now we are also getting the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vṛndāvana life. When everything is Kṛṣṇa, that is Vṛndāvana life. Why Vṛndāvana life is so exalted? Because they have no other shelter except Kṛṣṇa. The whole book <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> is therefore center Kṛṣṇa. That's all. But there are many varieties of activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's ninety chapters there. That's a drop in the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every page, the center is Kṛṣṇa. Not only the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book. All our books-<span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>-the center is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> the center is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> center is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> the center is Kṛṣṇa. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Similarly, our, this book, the center is Kṛṣṇa. When we open a temple, the center is Kṛṣṇa. In this way manage, promotion. All spend for promotion. Then the income tax will not be able to touch your hair, what to speak of your body. (laughter) So now our counterpropaganda is going on. The center is Kṛṣṇa. Big, big Kṛṣṇa's name are coming: "These Kṛṣṇa people," "These Kṛṣṇa devotees," "This Kṛṣṇa center"-that is our triumph. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> There is a letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Letter from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was mentioning it this morning. We intercept their newsletters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are simply talking about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That is our triumph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're in a <span class="Italic">Kaṁsa-sampradāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Following the example of Kaṁsa, unfavorable meditation on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that will also do benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Their center is Kṛṣṇa also, only they're demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are receipts, Śrīla Prabhupāda, each one for two thousand dollars deposited in your account in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rent tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. We already entered that. Both times from Balavanta in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You enter. Enter this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Two from Balavanta, two from Rūpānuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Debit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is from an organization called "Committee Engaged in Freeing Minds." Freeing the mind. That is their name. And this is sent out all over the United States. It says, "Confidential. Not for publication."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) And it is out to the enemies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In capital letters it says, "HELP PUSH THE HARE KRSNA COURT ACTION. There are two legal cases in progress..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "There are two legal cases in progress at this time that we must support-one in New York and one in Los Angeles. In New York the two ISKCON leaders have been indicted by the Queens County Grand Jury for unlawful imprisonment and attempted grand larceny. In Los Angeles, ISKCON and Madonna Slavin have accused her family of kidnapping, and charges of unlawful imprisonment have been entered against the mother and several other members of the Slavin family and two friends." These two friends are the professional deprogrammers. Then it says, "As in nearly all of these cases, the media will greatly influence the outcome. Do not underestimate the power of the media. We therefore must tell our story..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's already become media.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "We must therefore tell our story to them in great number, and in this way the world will hear of it. As of this date, HK," short for Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughter) They're chanting Kṛṣṇa. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say, "As of this date, Hare Kṛṣṇa has been able to flood both the media and the District Attorney's offices with support for their side..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're admitting. That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "...and they are way ahead of those on our side who believe that it is not a religious issue. Sun Yung Moon"-this is that Reverend Moon-"has been largely exposed in the Press. But not the Kṛṣṇas."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the more they expose, the more implicated. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Most people think of them, if at all, as loving, peaceful, prayerful children with strange customs and dress but low-key action and behavior."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that behavior, low...? Lowky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Low key.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Means not violent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nice people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "But they do not know about their forceful, harassing solicitation..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "...begging tactics."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that most people do not know how aggressive we really are. "Most of the families with young people involved with Hare Kṛṣṇa..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...very important letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We sent this to all the temples in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And give me one copy. I shall keep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is all based on the information received by various parent groups. "These people usually fear physical harm that may come to them and to their children who are in Hare Kṛṣṇa, as well as forcibly permanent separation from their children in Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is meaning, liberation. This is liberation, forcely separating from <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That they do not know. <span class="Italic">māyām etaṁ taranti te.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Hare Kṛṣṇa is known to hide out those whose families want them out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Family?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If the family wants them out, we have a reputation that we will hide them, so the family cannot get them. "One example is in the Queens case." That's Ādi Keśava Mahārāja. The charge of attempted grand larceny stems from an alleged extortion attempt against the Shapiro family by the temple leaders who wanted money from the parents and threatened to harm their son..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "...unless the money was given."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is false, completely false. "One of the things we can do is give moral support to these families. How better to do it than to show your support by writing to the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This we can bring a charge against them: "Prove that we wanted money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, we are counter... We are fighting them. "...by writing to the District Attorney's"-those are the Justice Department Offices-"or contacting your local media." Then they give the addresses of people in New York and two addresses in Los Angeles who you should write to telling them about all the knowledge you have about all the abuses of Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then it says, "You should commence action for a legal deprogramming. If other families of Hare Kṛṣṇa victims would go to court to get a legal conservatorship or guardianship with an intended writ of habeas corpus..." Now, what this means is you go to the court, and you say "My dear judge, my son is in Hare Kṛṣṇa. He has been brainwashed." And you have a paper from a psychiatrist that says, "Yes, he is definitely acting in a robotlike way." Then the court will say, "All right, you're the parent. So we give you legal guardianship over the son."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can place a counter psychiatrist and counter... Just like Cox's statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is one law in America where they don't even give you a chance to defend. They immediately give the parents the guardianship. Now, this law was written to protect old people, and they are cheating and using the law against us. Sometimes old people become senile, and, let's say, they'll do harmful things. They may give away their money. They may do things in a state of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we have got parents' organization also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now we do. Anyway, they're using this law against us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they will do. They will do their best. We have to do our best. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say, "This would enable the court to remove the young person from the temple for medical examination and evaluation by cult-knowledgeable psychiatrists and psychologists." In other words, deprogramming. "This is the best thing to do. The media would report it..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. But one psyciatrist may give one verdict, but other psychiatrist may give another verdict. Then how the court will decide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because in these temporary guardianship cases, the court is already against us in many places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But... Against may be, but so far the decision of the psychiatrist, we can present our psychiatrist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's no equal time given. It's one-sided only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means in the name of justice, injustice is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. This law is unconstitutional. I mentioned that there is a group of lawyers who are now organizing a committee nationwide to defend us, and they're going to prove that this law should be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the right cause. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They're already working on that. So then they say, "If you can do this to your son, then it will get national news media into the scene, and then people will learn about Hare Kṛṣṇa in particular, and all the effects of destructive cults on our youth." Then it says, "We have a legal packet which contains advice on the procedure and techniques for legal deprogramming."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So nowhere they have mentioned my name. That is good. (laughter) Otherwise, I would have been the target. That was very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes... One of the general charges they make against all the different religious groups in America is that the leader is actually making a lot of profit for himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Like this Reverend Moon, he lives in a very, very big house, and he has a big car. And this Guru Maharaj-ji, he has his own airplane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru Maharaj-ji has got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He had his own airplane, which they had to sell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That fat boy, Guru Maharaj-ji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he had. So what is his position now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His family has called him a false guru. So there's a slip.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What was the effect of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He lost a lot of his following. The main ones... There are a few small ones. Moon, Reverend Moon, he is a big demon, and they're attacking him, so that's good. But then they try to make us to be just like him. I've heard them say that you have a big penthouse in Los Angeles, and you always drive in Rolls Royces. I've heard these things, but we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I heard all this. In Germany they accused me. You told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, they also say that you're enjoying all this money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Harikeśa said that if they're successful in their prosecution against Haṁsadūta, then they'll prosecute yourself, one leader to the other. They say that the leaders are manipulating, and the other ones are just robots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes, we're all robots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Whenever they meet a devotee who appears to be intelligent and not have any symptoms of being brainwashed, they accuse him of being one of the leaders. If I'm debating with one of them, or if any devotee, and they see he's very intelligent, they say, "But you are one of the leaders."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly that is a fact. (laughter) All GBC, they are leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So you're not brainwashed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, the leaders are the ones who are brainwashing everyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But then if someone becomes a leader...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then they say, "The next best thing to do after you get the deprogramming is to hold a press conference to explain all the reasons that there is a need for criminal conviction of destructive cult leaders. Have ex-victims, especially of Hare Kṛṣṇa, present. The truth of their personal experiences carry great weight with reporters. It is now necessary to awaken America to how widespread..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I... In the beginning... I have told many times when I first went that "If I say these prohibitions, who will accept?" And now it has taken a shape, it has become a problem throughout the country. I was thinking, "Who will hear me? As soon as I'll say this, they'll say, 'Go home.' " But by Kṛṣṇa's arrangement it has become a problem. That is Kṛṣṇa's grace. It has become a problem for them; it is success for me. Yes. I presented something which is now a problem for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They waited too long. They didn't tell you to go home soon enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) No, my creed is at their home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> You planted seeds in their home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes they capture... Very rarely they capture one of our members and they convince him to leave. And after they convince him to leave our movement, then they tell him many lies about us. And then he goes on television and tells the American public that we brainwashed him. So sometimes they get some of our ex-members to speak against us. This is going on. In Los Angeles I have met three ex-devotees who viciously lie about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just minor devo... They're never leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Initiated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One girl. And they're vicious, very hateful. Because they are constantly being told that we are evil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nitāi has gone there to do it? (chuckles) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. I think... Last I heard he was still in Vṛndāvana area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he is in Vṛndāvana, that is good for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He is crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then it says, "Other things need to be done. We have to get supportive comments from professionals and authorities in areas of religion, education, mental health and physical health, law, and sociology. Statements by experts and professionals carry a lot of weight."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in our side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "Ask your contact to comment or express his opinion of such things as that this is not a matter of religion; that there is resulting mental and physical harm; the right of self-determination means the right to have a free mind; destruction of the family unit..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if one has the right to have a free mind, why he cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, their argument is that we do not allow him to consider alternatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the question of a free mind? That means you brainwash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Free mind means everyone has the right. That is free mind. If you force something, then where is the free mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So actually they are understanding that once you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, you will stop thinking about <span class="Italic">māyā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're admitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They understand that... Their claim is that this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is dangerous. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...is dangerous because it makes you stop thinking about so many other things. That is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our victory. That is victory because Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura said that <span class="Italic">viṣaya viṣānale, dibā-niśi hiyā jwale, taribare nā koinu upāy, golokera prema-dhana, hari-nāma saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmilo kene tāy:</span> "This material world is the burning fire of anxiety. So in order to get rid of it, we have to take shelter of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> which is imported from the spiritual sky." That is a fact. So as soon as you take shelter of Hare Kṛṣṇa, naturally we are relieved from this blazing fire of material existence. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Finished. <span class="Italic">Bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. Mahā-dāvāgni,</span> this fire of material existence, finished. That's a fact. So they have pointed out. This circumstance, it is good. Yes. That is the position. Yes. Caitanya Mahāprabhu recommends that. In order to get rid of this blazing fire, <span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">:</span> chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Anyway, this goes on, but then what they're saying is there has to be a very big case where a cult leader of Hare Kṛṣṇa is sentenced to jail. So they're writing to say that "Now we have to find lawyers who will be willing to take up this cause very inexpensively."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there is no money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But one recent development which will change that is that they have appealed to the government that they are an educational group. Therefore they should be tax exempt like any other educational organization, and the government has agreed. Now they have gotten their tax exemption, so now these parents can donate lots of... Different people will start donating lots of money to them as tax write-offs. So I think that we will see that their activities will be expanded this year, because now they are tax exempt, they'll get a lot of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That news article said that someone had given them $105,000. Some parents of a cult...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are rich parents. They can do that. And every parent is unhappy. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The fighting will increase this year. It's getting very acute, as you said in that letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are feeling the strength of Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We're becoming the main target. Formerly it was this Reverend Moon, but his movement has been..., so many scandals, that it is beginning to lose its appeal to people. So now we are the main target faced. That is the most significant thing about this newsletter, that they are saying that "Formerly Reverend Moon... But he has already been exposed. So now let us direct all our energy against Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not know whom to expose. That they do not know. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are making it possible for us to preach in all the TVs, radios, and newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) That is our opportunity. The governor has invited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, after Kṛṣṇa told Rukmiṇī that He would have to leave her...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...then she was speaking to Him and saying that "You say that no one can understand Your activities. And also no one can understand the activities of Your devotee." So nobody knows what we're doing. They all put some psychological name, but they can't grasp the essence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So they're afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> One of their big charges is that when we go out and distribute our books we are very aggressive, and therefore it is a sign that we are not actually religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every salesman must be aggressive. That is a qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say we are interfering with the right of the person. He doesn't want to speak to us, but we insist that he speak to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is salesman's qualification. Nobody is dying for our book, but if we can create market for our book, that is our qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So then they will say, "Then that means you are not a religion. You're simply a business."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From business side... Religion means we are expert in every way. We can cheat also very nicely, which you cannot do. That is religion, expert in everything. <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇaḥ.</span> And Kṛṣṇa says that "Amongst the cheaters, I am the greatest cheat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They think religious people should be fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but our religion is not that. The most intelligent man can be religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They should be fools, and they should be poor. And we are neither fools nor poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We always answer their charge that "You are saying that all the people are being upset by us, but actually the proof is that we are getting so many letters every day, hundreds of letters, and all these letters, no complaints. Simply they want more information. They want to order all our books. So from our mail order we can see that these people are writing to us because they have been sold books on the street."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these letters are important. You can publish these letters in book. Those who are ordering our books, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Also, when we tell them, "Our magazine used to sell two hundred thousand copies a month, now it is selling five hundred thousand, seven hundred fifty thousand, some months one million copies. so that means the public is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Becoming more interested. So let us go on fighting with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no disappointment. <span class="Italic">Yudhyasva mām anusmara [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">].</span> We shall fight and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then everything is all right. We cannot stop fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually, one argument that they use... They have found an old <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> article that I think you wrote, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It was about Arjuna's position during the battle of Kurukṣetra, where he had to fight against his relatives. You were commenting that "So sometimes you may have to even kill your family members for Kṛṣṇa." So they take this magazine article, and they say that "Hare Kṛṣṇa leaders are teaching all the devotees to kill their parents." So this is an example of how they will distort everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... You can distort anything. If there is expert distortion, it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> We can kill our parents even, like Prahlāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is actually required. Prahlāda did not protest. It is a great sin, if your father is being killed before you, if you do not protest even, "Why you are killing?" not to give protection. But even if you do not, then you are not worthy son. So in that way Prahlāda Mahārāja was accused that in his presence his father was being killed. He did not protest, neither he... Rather, he was ready with the garland: (laughter) "As soon as my father is killed, immediately garland the Lord." So that is not the fact. And he is... Later on, he requested that "My father was a great offender. So kindly give him protection." So he's not..., that son. He knows... He knew that this, "My father is being killed by the nails of my Lord. It is his great fortune." Why shall he protest? He's seeing that "My father is being released from this material existence." Why shall he protest? And still to confirm it, he requested the Lord that "This, my rascal father made so many offenses..." But for him he did not ask anything, but he's such a good son that for demon father he requested. So how much faithful son he was, this is the proof. Not that he was unfaithful to him. He knew it, that "Let my father's body be separated from his soul by the Lord. That is good for him." And still to confirm it he personally requested that "My father may be excused." "Why your father? Your father's father, his father, everyone, up to fourteen generations."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Paropakāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So to become devotee means to do the best service to the family. If there is one devotee in the family, all the forefathers, they are delivered. So anyway, don't be disappointed. Go on fighting and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Everything will be right. There is no cause of disappointment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Actually the field now for preaching in America is better than ever. More people are becoming interested to hear what we are and what our message is than ever before because of all this controversy. Whenever something is making newspapers that is confusing or controversial, they immediately want to hear about it because they have a tendency to look for faults.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But they're very eager to have us come to the colleges and high schools...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...to speak. It's much easier now to get lecturing engagements than ever before. They are after us to give our lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not engage Brahmānanda in that business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think he could do well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In New York or L.A. Wherever you think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him go to the colleges accompanied by some other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I was thinking that especially right now, this time, is the prime time for preaching in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let as many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> as possible. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī,</span> <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Cannot possibly cover all the territory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There's so much engagement in America right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as possible, I think Brahmānanda should be engaged with some assistant or some superior. Two. He should not be alone. That is the best solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No one's giving engagements in New York. Now I have two people in L.A. beginning, Jagannath Sūta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then this <span class="Italic">kīrtana...</span> This is <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> speaking. Whatever little fault is there, that will be rectified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He'll like it too. Coming into America to help fight the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately do that. This is conclusion. Engage him in preaching, and this is the opportunity. You said that "We require so many." Similarly, Madhudviṣa can be engaged also in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Wow. I was thinking... I wrote him a letter. He was very happy to receive it. He posted it in the restaurant. I invited him to come to Los Angeles. I was encouraging him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am asking him from the very beginning, that he come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If he doesn't feel comfortable coming all the way to India, maybe I can invite him to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have sent him telegram, Madhudviṣa. I have sent him telegram that "You come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He may be too entangled to come right away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that entanglement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Well, he is not following all our principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's got one woman friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Govinda dāsī says that he doesn't want to come to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He thinks it's too austere. He needs something more gradual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He never liked India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But this is a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then engage them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If he's willing, he could give speaking engagements. I tell you, America is just wide open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why not take this... Suppose he is attracted by some woman. Let him dress like a gentleman and keep with the woman as husband and wife and preach. What is the wrong there? Whatever is done, you close up that chapter. Now you become a householder. There is no harm. And live as a gentleman householder and preach. But don't play duplicity in the dress of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> to keep private relations. That is not good. That is duplicity. Better openly become a respectable householder and serve Kṛṣṇa. Our service is main thing, either in this dress or that dress. So if you cannot keep yourself sincerely as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> then get yourself married. But you cannot keep the girl as friend. That is also not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But for Brahmānanda, he may remain <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>? Brahmānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his choice. But we say that "Don't be hypocrite." That's all. If he thinks now he'll be able to continue as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> he'll not fall down, he'll be careful, let him continue. That will depend on his sincerity. But I say that if you cannot remain as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> get yourself married, live like a gentleman and serve Kṛṣṇa. Why should you give up Kṛṣṇa's service? That is my point. As you want to live, any way, comfortably, do it. We never condemned <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> If <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> is not suitable for you, you remain as a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I'm going to call him this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Brahmānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> To give him direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he's coming. Kīrtanānanda has gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Kīrtanānanda has gone, but now they are a little confused what should be done next. They originally... The plan was that he was going to come here to be your secretary. So now they need some new instruction. So we thought Jagadīśa could call and invite him to come to America to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is better. That is better. To write some letters here, that is not so important. But if he can preach and he...
