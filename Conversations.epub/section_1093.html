<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they'll not walk on the street. This was the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> You would never see them at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> You want lunch? Do you want some lunch, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If woman walks on the street then she is not respectable. Now women are going to offices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now they are doing everything. Even leading nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nation is also doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In President Carter's new cabinet he included a woman as a secretary now. As a minister, for the first time I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In England also they have a woman Prime Minister for the first time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She's a leader of the opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, she was the Prime Minister as well. She's the opposition now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman is acting as police in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> In Los Angeles there was this one man at the temple that we suspected that he had a gun. So we called the police. It is a difficult job for police when someone has a gun. They always send the best men. So a car pulled up and a woman got out, and she crept up on the man to arrest him and the men stayed in the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is becoming a farce. (pause) What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are just some letters I'm sending with Rādhā-vallabha to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> When we reprint the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> trilogy this year, the hardbound, I was wondering, could we put more pictures in the second and third volumes? Not changing, but additional.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why increase cost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> I don't think it would be that much. The first volume has over sixty pictures and the second one only has thirty-two and the third only has twenty-four. Anyway, anything we do will increase the cost but not so significant. Few cents. We were thinking that the Kṛṣṇa Books were originally printed many many years ago and since then we have a lot of nice paintings of Kṛṣṇa's pastimes that we could put in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can give without increasing price, there is no harm. Or for this cents. Let us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> is ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> If it's only an insignificant increase then we'll put some in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you don't increase price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Oh, to the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, to the customer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> Yes. That's no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
