<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> This is Mr. Sharma, the head technician at the airport, radar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I went to your MIT, I challenged that "Where is that technological department where a dead man can be brought into life?" It was interesting speech. The students gathered. This body is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as machine. Do you know that? This body is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as machine. <span class="Italic">Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ sarva bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati<br class="calibre2"/>bhrāmāyan sarva bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>yantrārūḍhāni māyayā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Just like you make a tour by driving a motorcar, similarly, the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> is touring all over the universe riding on this machine. This is machine. So... <span class="Italic">Aiye aiye.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (guest enters) (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> We have arranged for your <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> <span class="Italic">Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> This is machine. This body is machine made by the material energy, as all other machine are made by the <span class="Italic">kṣitir-āp-tejo marud-vyoma,</span> earth, water, air, fire. These are the ingredients, any machine. Suppose it is made of iron. So iron is another form of earth. So as all other machines are made with these material elements, similarly, this body is also made with the material elements, and it is <span class="Italic">yantra.</span> It is particularly mentioned. But this <span class="Italic">yantra</span> is not ordinary <span class="Italic">yantra.</span> You cannot make it. But it is <span class="Italic">yantra.</span> It is made by somebody, and the ingredients are the material elements. So where is that technology? It is made of matter, and it is made by somebody as other machines are made with the material... [break] ...and made by somebody. So where is that advancement of technology? A motorcar, when stops, technology department can repair it and again it runs. So where is that advancement of technology that when this machine stops you run on, again repair it? This was my challenge in your institution. Can you answer this? You have got so many advancement, the nuclear energy and everything. But why you cannot give life to the machine stopped? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> There's no soul in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the fact, we know. We know that is a fact, that... My point is that the modern age, they are very much proud of advanced technology. So where is that knowledge? And why people do not tax their brains to get this knowledge? This is very important subject matter. But where is that knowledge? And why they do not try to do it? We get information from the Supreme Personality of Godhead that this <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> the driver... Not driver. The passenger. We are passenger, and driver is God, and machine made by material energy, <span class="Italic">māyā... Yantrārūḍhāni māyayā.</span> The similarity is there. Just like motorcar is manufactured by somebody and the passenger is there and the driver is there, similarly, this is a machine made by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> I am the passenger, and God is driver. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati bhrāmāyan [Bg. 18.61]. Bhrāmāyan,</span> the driver, the passenger of the owner, he is asking, "Mr. Driver, you go this way." So He's driving. Just like the same-Arjuna is asking Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">senayor ubhayor madhye rathaṁ sthāpaya me 'cyuta: [Bg. 1.21]</span> "Just between these two parties of soldiers, please keep my chariot." The same thing. The chariot driver, He is the Supersoul. In this body there are two souls. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> That he's also <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñā. Kṣetra</span> is this body, and <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñā</span> one knows, this body.... Just like I know it is my finger. I never say, "I finger." It is my finger. So similarly, the driver also can say, "It is my car," and the proprietor also can say. So two persons, one driver and one passenger, or the proprietor.... And the body is machine. The subjects are there. Why you do not try to understand the subject matter? Then where is your advancement? That is my challenge. Why you are so much proud of your advancement of knowledge. What is this knowledge? Tell me. You are young man. I am giving you the challenge. Either you admit that you are not advanced or make advancement. Why you set aside this difficult subject matter and become proud by making a small machine that you are advanced? Where is your advancement? (Hindi) He is Mr. Bajaj, the proprietor of the Bajaj Electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Mahārāja, in the context of the universe, the technological and scientific advancement is very, very insignificant. But as far as human beings are concerned, they feel that they have achieved great deal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? You cannot give life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Because there is a change from the past. So they feel that there is a difference. But that is at a very low level...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my point, that you are becoming so much proud of your technological..., but what you have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is very insignificant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is my point. Why you become falsely proud that you have done so advancement that you don't care for God, you don't care for the original manufacturer? That is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The other day there was a doctor who had come from America for transplantation of kidney, and he has given a lecture in the Rotary Club. I was there. Now they give so much importance to the person who is able to transplant kidney from one body to the other, but how about the whole human being or the universe which has been created by God? Now, this is just a very, very insignificant thing which is already there which is just transplanted. But they feel so happy and proud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my point, falsely proud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And Mahārāja, are they able to increase the life by a single moment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They say they have achieved so much. Are they able to increase it by even a single moment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This breathing is given there, that "You must breathe so many million times. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> finished." Just like you wind the watch. It will run or go round so many times. As soon as the finish, then stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Unwound, it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The energy is limited. So by the yogic process they increase because they stop breathing. Breathing is limited. Just like you have got bank balance, two hundred thousand. If you don't spend, then it remains</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But you got to breathe. You can't stop breathing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, by yogic process, you can stop breathing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Stop breathing or lengthen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop breathing means you don't spend. You have got a limited breathing period. By yogic process, you stop breathing, but you remain. That is mystic yoga. So similarly, you can simply increase your life by not using the breathing process. That is <span class="Italic">praṇāyāma.</span> That is <span class="Italic">praṇāyāma.</span> So... But you cannot exceed the limit. That is not possible. (Hindi) You don't keep hygienic life. (Hindi) You infect. That is your fault. (Hindi) To live ordinarily healthy life, that is... But if you transgress the hygienic principle, if you transgress the law of nature, you must suffer. Similarly, we are suffering in this material world-the covering is there-because we wanted to transgress the laws of God. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vañcha kare.</span> When we forget our relationship with Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa is the original master, and I am the servant," as soon as you forget this relationship, this is contamination, immediately. Everyone is trying to become another Kṛṣṇa. This is struggle. Here in this material world you'll find everyone is trying to become very, very big-big leader, big politician, big businessman, big, big, big. But he is not big. That is the disease. He is not big, and he's trying to become big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> This Khorana has put out one (gene?), and if it keeps growing, it will really havoc with artificial development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He says Dr. Khorana, he has made a gene.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gene?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Living cell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, they take it that the hereditary qualities that a person inherits is determined by these genes. So now they're thinking that if they can control the genes, they can create their own type of human being according to their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can't. That, this nonsense speaking, is going on throughout the history, but they'll never be able. That is the fact. "We are trying. We shall do in future"-these things are going on. But this is all stories. We don't believe in these nonsense things. They'll never be happy. That is not possible. Therefore I challenged your technology that "Where is that department? Do it!" First of all do it. Suppose if a man is in business. He may say that "I am trying to become a millionaire." But he cannot say that "I am millionaire." So the so-called scientist, "Yes, we are trying." You are trying, that's all right. But when you become, then you call scientist. There is no possibility, and because you are trying I have to accept you are scientist? Recently in California University one professor came. He has gained the Nobel Prize, Chemical Evolution. They are trying to prove that life is generated by chemical evolution. So in that meeting I had my one student. He's Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara. He's also big chemist. So he knows. He talks with me. He has got the idea. He has written one book, <span class="Italic">Scientific Basis of Kṛṣṇa Consciousness.</span> So he challenged that "Suppose if I give you the chemicals, can you produce life?" The answer-"That I cannot say." Why he talks nonsense? He is theorizing that life is made of chemicals, but if you give the chemicals, why you cannot make life? When I was in South Africa... Where is that? Pretoria or something? There are many factories for chicken killing. Chicken incubator. So one of the students, worker there, I said, "Suppose this is a chicken factory. So take one egg and analyze the chemicals. There is some white substance, yellow substance. It is covered with some cell. You can do it, and put that in the incubator and get a chicken. Why don't you do that?" The rascal could not answer. "Don't talk of big, big life. Make a chicken." And this rascal cannot do that, and still, they'll talk big, big words. What do you think? Are they not rascals? These rascals they are talking big, big words. First of all prove. Make one egg. Then talk of big, big brain. Make one egg. It is... Everyone can see. There is some white chemicals and some yellow chemicals, and it is covered, and it... You analyze and combine the chemical in the same way and put it in the incubator and get one chicken. Why? You are technologist. Say why they cannot do it. And when they cannot do it, why they talk so big, big word, mislead others and mislead himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> No, they feel so proud because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> ...God's creation is so huge and vast and unfathomable. If they are able to unravel even a small part of it which was not known to human beings beforehand. So they are so proud. They don't say that they can do what God can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is known. It is known. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ:</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7] "This life is my part and parcel." As soon as you study what is this life, you understand Kṛṣṇa, quality, what is Kṛṣṇa. So here is the hint, that Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it is very small particle. That is also mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra: </span></div>
<div class="Verse">keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya<br class="calibre2"/>satadhā kalpitasya ca<br class="calibre2"/>jīvo bhāgasya vijñeyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sa anantāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The measurement of soul is given there in the <span class="Italic">śāstra:</span> one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. So everything is there. It is not matter. And that is instructed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Nāyaṁ śāstra... Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam akledyo 'śoṣya eva ca.</span> "This spiritual spark cannot be cut into pieces." <span class="Italic">Acchedyo 'yam adāhyo 'yam:</span> "It cannot be burned into the fire." So... (aside:) Come on. But these rascals, they are seeing that "The body is burnt into ashes, so everything is finished." And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">adāhyo 'yam:</span> "It cannot be burned." So it remains. And that transmigrates. And that small particle you have no eyes to see. You say, therefore, "Why shall I believe transmigration?" How nature's law is working so subtle way? <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> But the <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> I say, rascal, not manufactured by me. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra vimūḍha. Vimūḍha</span> means a great rascal. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha</span> means rascal, ass, and <span class="Italic">vi, viśeṣa,</span> particularly, first-class ass, <span class="Italic">vimūḍha.</span> Under false pride, he is thinking, "I am everything." <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti... [Bg. </span>3.27]. "I can do anything by science, by this technology." That's... <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhātmā,</span> great rascals. And these great rascals, they are leading the world. Therefore people are in darkness. They have become leaders, the so-called scientists and educationists and political leaders. All set of rascals, and they have become leaders. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are blind, and they are leading other blind men, so people are kept in darkness, and the opportunity of this human life is lost. By nature's way, by evolutionary process, we get this human form of life. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">. Manuṣya, arthadam.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja says <span class="Italic">durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma.</span> Such life, important life, they are wasting like cats and dogs. So this is education; this is advancement. People are not given the opportunity to utilize this valuable life for understanding higher things. This is plight of this civilization. They are growing like cats and dogs and dying like cats and dogs. And <span class="Italic">yathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> and according to his work, he has to accept another body. That is nature's law. So in this life I am very big man, but by work, <span class="Italic">karmaṇā daiva netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> by superior administration, I have to accept a body of dog. Then what is the value of your being great now? That technology is unknown, although it is stated there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Everything is. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So Kṛṣṇa never says that "You'll get such and such body." <span class="Italic">Dehāntara.</span> "You'll have to change the body." Now, suppose... There are 8,400,000 types of bodies. Suppose next time I become a tree. Then just see horrible position. Here is a tree. I am within this room, sitting so comfortably, and the tree is standing there. I can get that life also, <span class="Italic">karmaṇā,</span> by my work. So this technology is unknown. And we are very much proud of advancement of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Boliye.</span> Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I don't know. I've never given very serious thought considering and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, these are not the subject matter for serious thought? Do you think? You are under the grip of the laws of material nature. Do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you should be under the grip of material nature? And if there is way, why should you not take? <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etaṁ taranti te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Our analysis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Analysis... (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So why you are trying to get better position? That should be the endeavor, that we may get better position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga, satāṁ prasaṅgāt.</span> The <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga...</span> We know that word only, but if we don't take advantage, then what is meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5) (Indian man):</span> Execution part is more important of the <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span> means <span class="Italic">sat.</span> <span class="Italic">Sat</span> means which is true and not contaminated. That is <span class="Italic">sat. Oṁ tat sat.</span> So <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span> means to associate with spiritual knowledge. That is <span class="Italic">sat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And execution of the discourse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, <span class="Italic">saṅga</span> means execution. When you associate with medical association or sharebrokers' association, simply go there and sit down is not your business. You have to do something. You have to do something. <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga</span> means that. <span class="Italic">Tad-yoṣanāt aśu apavarga-vartmani. Sat-saṅga</span> means you have to take the knowledge and use it for practical purpose. That is <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> So our this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to give the <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> opening centers all over the world. If people take advantage of it they'll be benefited. But if he is <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā,</span> then it is very unfortunate. <span class="Italic">Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ [SB </span>1.1.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Kali-yuga. The leaders also do not associate with <span class="Italic">sat,</span> and they create their own imagination. <span class="Italic">Sat, oṁ tat sat. Bhagavān</span> is the supreme <span class="Italic">sat.</span> So they do not care for <span class="Italic">Bhagavān,</span> so there is no <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga. Asat-saṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sat-saṅga chāḍi kāinu asate vilāsa<br class="calibre2"/>te karaṇe lāgi more karma bandha phāṅsa</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I given up <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> and I am trying to enjoy <span class="Italic">asat.</span>" <span class="Italic">Asato mā sad gamaya.</span> That is Vedic injunction. "But I do not care for <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span>." <span class="Italic">Sat-saṅga chāḍi.</span> You have to take up something after giving up something. So our present position is <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga chāḍi kāinu asate vilāsa.</span> "I have given up <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> and I am trying to enjoy in <span class="Italic">asat.</span> The result is I am entangled in <span class="Italic">karma bandha phāṅsa.</span> According to <span class="Italic">karma,</span> I am changing my body, and today I am human being and tomorrow I am a dog. And again from dog to another body, another body." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6) (Indian man):</span> <span class="Italic">Asato mā sama grad?</span> You said, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sad gamaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> So the translation of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sad</span> means "Try to come to the transcendental platform, <span class="Italic">sat,</span> and don't remain in this <span class="Italic">asat.</span>" <span class="Italic">Asat</span> means which is temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> And <span class="Italic">tamasi mā jyotir gamaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! <span class="Italic">Tamasa...</span> "Don't remain in the darkness; come to the light." So this is the Vedic injunction. But we don't take advantage of the instruction. We think that "If I can make one table from a ordinary wooden plank, that is advancement." This is technology. This nice polished table is a transformation of the crude wooden plank. So if a crude wooden plank is transferred into nice table, we see: "Oh, this is advancement." What is actual benefit? I can do without this table. But we have taken: "This is advancement. Transforming the form of an element into another, that is advancement." So <span class="Italic">asate vilāsa.</span> This is <span class="Italic">asat,</span> this wood, either in crude form or in transferred form. So I am taking credit because a crude wood has been turned into a table. So that is my <span class="Italic">vilāsa.</span> So <span class="Italic">sat saṅga chāḍi kāinu asate vilāsa.</span> So I am now bound up. I can become a very nice carpenter. Does it mean that I am self-realized? If you have learned the art of turning crude wood into a table, nice table, you may get the credit of becoming a nice carpenter; that does not mean you are self-realized. They are taking credit of this turning crude wood into nice table, and they're thinking that "Our life is successful." This is going on. And the real technology, that "I am not this body; I have been put into this condition, and I am transmigrating from one body to another"-there is no such knowledge. For the temporary.... [break] ...temporary thing, flickering thing, like children. Children is very busy on the beach, making sand palaces, and he's very happy. So our position is like that. But we should be intelligent enough that "There is our real life, permanent life, not this temporary life," that "This life is temporary. There is another life." <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> "This <span class="Italic">śarīra</span> is not..." <span class="Italic">Avināśi tu tad viddhi yena sarvam idaṁ tatam.</span> So many things.... The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is full of information, but we don't take advantage. We are so unfortunate. And it is our country. This is Indian culture. We have given up this. (Hindi) Gandhiji, he was supposed to be a great student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And the such a big <span class="Italic">āśrama, Sevagrama.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā arcana</span>? <span class="Italic">Boliye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7) (Indian man):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is a way of life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> And is what has to be followed by those who believe in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Believe or not believe, that is another thing. But if you want to live worthy, then you have to study <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You believe... Just like somebody believes or not believes in <span class="Italic">dehāntara,</span> but nature's course will go on. Young man thinks "I'll remain young. I shall not become old man." He may believe like that, but he has to become old man. That is nature's law. So there is no question of "believe" or "not believe." If you believe, then you are benefited; if you don't believe, you go to hell. It is not the question of belief. I was speaking in South Africa in a university. So one gentleman, <span class="Italic">Arya-samāji</span> said... When I was explaining <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ,</span> so he objected that "Why you bring Hindu belief?" "And, nonsense, it is Hindu belief?" It is said that <span class="Italic">kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā:</span> one boy is becoming young man. Is this for Hindu? It is not for the Muslim? And he said "Hindu belief." Such a fool he is. He said, "It is Hindu belief." Kṛṣṇa is giving this example. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanam [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]. Kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.</span> So does it mean that Hindus only from <span class="Italic">kaumāra</span> become <span class="Italic">yuvaka,</span> and from <span class="Italic">yuvaka</span> to old man, and the Muslims, they do not? It is science! You believe or not believe. If you don't take the fact, then your life is missing. What is the question? Two plus two equal to four-it is not Hindu calculation, Muslim calculation or Christian calculation. You cannot say that "No, according to our Muslim calculation, two plus two equal to five." Two plus two is always four, either for a Hindu or Muslim or Christian. So whatever is spoken in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that is for understanding of the human society. Why do you take: "It is Hindu belief. It is Indian belief"? It is science. That is our misfortune, that a science we are accepting as a kind of belief, faith. And that we are neglecting. That is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We are the victims of the British Empire who ruled us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No, you are victims of yourself. Why...? British is not here now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8) (Indian man):</span> We are indoctrined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> British is not here now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (8):</span> No, they have indoctrined such a philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what was there before British came? This is human weakness of our own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is... You... You have been taught that Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary person, maybe little more in knowledge. That you are taking like that. <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍuka-nyāya.</span> <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍa,</span> the toad in the well, he is informed, "Oh, I have seen one Atlantic Ocean." So he is thinking "Atlantic Ocean may be.... This well is three feet. It may be four feet. Or five. Come on, ten." These rascals are thinking like that-<span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā [Bg. </span>9.11]-that "Kṛṣṇa may be more intelligent by one feet or two feet. Let us compromise-ten feet." This is going on. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "I am the Supreme." They won't believe. They'll manufacture their ideas. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> They won't believe that. And still, they'll declare, "I am student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>" They won't believe a word of Kṛṣṇa, and they'll say, "I am student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>." This is going on. This is our position. In India everyone says, "I have read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> three hundred times," but he does not know even a word. So this should be stopped. If we want to advance actually, you take every word of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and try to apply in life. Then everyone will be happy. That is a fact. The instruction is there. There is no difficulty to understand. There is no question of interpretation. Simply take it as it is and try to apply it in life-you'll be happy. And your human life will be successful. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Up to this human form of life, we have passed through so many evolutionary process, but if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then, after leaving this body, no more material body.</div>
<div class="Verse">janma karma ca divyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>me yo jānāti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma<br class="calibre2"/>naiti mām eti...<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.9]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">And that is success. If you simply study Kṛṣṇa, then your life is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">sahaja,</span> this is <span class="Italic">sahaja.</span> You are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sahaja.</span> <span class="Italic">Sahaja</span> means you are born along with Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is neither born, neither you are born. <span class="Italic">Sahaja,</span> this word, means <span class="Italic">saha ja,</span> "along with born." So you are part and parcel. Just like this finger is part and parcel of my body. When I was born the finger was also born. This is <span class="Italic">saha-ja.</span> The finger was not separately born. When I was born, the finger was born. So similarly, so long God is there, I am also there. So God is eternal; I am also eternal. You understand this? Then why you are changing bodies? And that is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9) (Indian man):</span> No, why do we at all enter into this circle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained. You want to be a separate Kṛṣṇa. That is your ambition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (9):</span> Initial thing is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is initial. A servant, big man's servant... That is natural, that "If I would have become the master." So a servant, if he wants to become the master, that is artificial. A servant remains a servant-he is happy. And as soon as he tries artificially to become the master, that is the beginning of distress. So we are eternal servant of God. As soon as we try to become God, that is the beginning of our suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) The starting is there. <span class="Italic">Icchā-dveṣa-samutthena sarge yānti parantapa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>7.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhūliyā jīva bhoga vāñchā kare, pāśate māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare.</span> As soon as you desire like this, that "I shall become God," so immediately there is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So when you are entangled in <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then there is question of <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> The <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means <span class="Italic">muktir hitvā 'nyathā rūpaṁ svarūpena avasthitiḥ.</span> This is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> <span class="Italic">Mukti</span> means when we are acting differently. That is my condition. That is my bondage. And when I act according to my original position, that is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> So everyone is acting here to become master. So there is no question of <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> As soon as you understand that "My real position is I am servant of God, so let me act as serv..."-then it is <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> <span class="Italic">Hitvā 'nyathā rūpam.</span> At the present moment we are trying to act as master. So you give it down, up. Act as servant. Then you are <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> Therefore a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is <span class="Italic">mukta. Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.

So if you become <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> if you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, immediately <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> instantly. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are conditioned, you are bound up on account of your sinful activities. So Kṛṣṇa says, "I'll give you relief from all the reaction of sinful activity. You surrender." So <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means one second. You surrender to Kṛṣṇa. It takes one second. But that is very difficult. That requires many, many births. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> After many, many births of suffering, when he comes to the knowledge that "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10) (Indian man):</span> Prabhupāda, surrender, <span class="Italic">sar...,</span> word, if you can give us a full explanation of the word surrender. What's the meaning of surrender and how one should do it? Basis of surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender, this is surrender, that... First of all, why you surrender? You must know it perfectly well that "Kṛṣṇa is master; I am servant." Otherwise there is no question of surrender. Then you have to believe that "Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> So now I have surrendered. I have no more fear. Kṛṣṇa will give me protection." To believe firmly... "Kṛṣṇa is all powerful. Kṛṣṇa is my master. He is not a fakir, that He's talking nonsense." We have to believe that. This is surrender. If you think, "Kṛṣṇa is another fakir like me. He's talking nonsense," then that is not surrender. You have to believe that. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> that <span class="Italic">śraddhā śabde viśvāsa niścaya.</span> This is <span class="Italic">śraddhā. Sraddha</span> is the beginning. That <span class="Italic">śraddhā</span> means when you firmly believe in Kṛṣṇa: "Yes, He'll give me protection." That is surrender. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇe bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.</span> When you come to this stage, firmly believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa, that is surrender. First of all, you have to check yourself whether you firmly believe in the words of God. If you don't believe, there is no question of surrender. Then you remain where you are. This is firm belief: "Kṛṣṇa says that He will give me protection. So let me surrender. I have surrendered to <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> I have not become happy. So why not surrender to Kṛṣṇa?" This is intelligence. You are not free. Then why you are declaring yourself as free? This is your disease. So intelligent means that I have no freedom actually. I am acting under the dictation of my senses. I am servant of my senses. So why not become servant of Kṛṣṇa? This is intelligent. Everyone is acting under senses, order of the senses. <span class="Italic">Kāmādinām kathidhā na kathidā palitā durni-deśaḥ.</span> Even I don't want to do it, something wrong, but my senses are dictating, so "All right, let me do it." So we are... I am servant of the senses. My position is twofold. Either I become the servant of the senses or I become servant of Kṛṣṇa. My position is the same. Simply I have to change it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> How to run away from the senses? I, being a servant of the senses, how to run away from the senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are servant. That is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> That is <span class="Italic">svāmī,</span> <span class="Italic">gosvāmī. Svāmī</span> means when he's no longer servant of the senses, a master of the senses. That is <span class="Italic">svāmī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> How to come to that position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That requires education, training. You have become a lawyer not in one day. You have been trained up. Then you are lawyer. Similarly, everyone has to be trained up how to become perfect servant, but he must agree in the beginning that "Now I shall become servant of Kṛṣṇa." Then everything is there. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā tato ruciḥ tataḥ athāsaktiḥ tato bhavaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> Faith. Firm faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faith. Yes. Faith means firm faith. Faith does not mean... Anyway, <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā.</span> This <span class="Italic">śraddhā,</span> if we increase this <span class="Italic">śraddhā,</span> you have to associate with <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>.

These boys, although they are trained up from childhood how to eat meat, how to drink, but now they have no time. They never ask me, "Swamiji, give me one rupee. I shall go to the cinema." Never. They have no time. <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt,</span> all <span class="Italic">anarthas</span> finished. These are the stages. Then his life becomes of devotion. <span class="Italic">Athāsaktiḥ niṣṭhā:</span> "Yes, I shall stick to Kṛṣṇa consciousness." <span class="Italic">Tato niṣṭhā ruciḥ. Ruciḥ</span> means taste.

These are the different stages. <span class="Italic">Sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ.</span> These are the different stages, <span class="Italic">kramaḥ.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> What's the difference between grace and mercy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grace means he'll willingly give you mercy, and mercy means you ask for mercy. <span class="Italic">Kṛpa-siddha. Sādhana-siddha</span> and <span class="Italic">kṛpa-siddha.</span> You are trying to earn one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees-that is <span class="Italic">sādhana.</span> But if somebody is gracious he can give you: "Take one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees. Don't work hard." That is grace. That is <span class="Italic">kṛpa.</span> You are ambitious for one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees or somebody graciously give you: "All right, take." There are many persons. So that is grace. Otherwise, you earn by your hard labor. That is <span class="Italic">sādhana.</span> Similarly, by association, by <span class="Italic">sādhana-bhakti,</span> you attain perfection, and by grace also, you can attain perfection. Two ways. So those who are <span class="Italic">kṛpa-siddha,</span> they are more fortunate. (Hindi) Preach this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. People will be benefited. You'll be benefited. Don't make unnecessary interpretation, misguide others and spoil your own life. That is very unfortunate. What is the difficulty to accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? There is no difficulty. Unfortunately we interpret in different way and take it other way. So our little attempt is to spread <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and whatever it may be, it is being accepted in the Western countries. Not by all.

First thing is that my students are advised, "No illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication up to the point of smoking cigarette and drinking tea, and no gambling." But this is their life. How they can give up this? That is... It is a shock. Therefore they say, "brainwashing," that "How a gentleman can give up all these things?" Many... No many. A few of my students, they left. They said that "Swamiji is denying the primary necessities of life." They left. They could not tolerate even. So I do not make any compromise. That you want to become my student you have to give up these things. So the responsible parents, they are appreciating that "My son is now purified." But some of them, there are...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Return my son." And "Take your son." And then he was asked, and he was silent. So mother began to cry.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So many people accumulate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not only... Not people, but saintly persons. Yes. They have actually executed <span class="Italic">bhajana, sādhana. Brahmeti paramātmeti.</span> Maybe somebody is <span class="Italic">brahmavādī,</span> somebody <span class="Italic">paramātmavādī,</span> somebody <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> but they're transcendental.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (11):</span> So many people come with one wish and the whole atmosphere is charged...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, spiritual... <span class="Italic">Sādhu-saṅga,</span> (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Sādhu-saṅga,</span> of course, is very important. Getting to take a dip in Ganges at that, during this period, has that got any particular significance apart from <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is. At least your faith is increased. With faith you take a dip. Faith cure. And Ganges herself is purifying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No. Is there special significance during this period? That is all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is... The significance is <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga,</span> purification. Our Vedic principle is: whatever is enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> we should accept it without any argument. That is Vedic injunction. This example we give generally: just like <span class="Italic">śaṅkha.</span> <span class="Italic">Śaṅkha</span> is the bone of an animal. So according to Vedic system, if you touch the bone of an animal, dead body animal, then you have to take bath immediately. But the <span class="Italic">śaṅkha</span> is pure. Now, you cannot argue that "It is the bone of an animal. You say one place that 'Bone of animal is impure. You have to take bath; you have touched it,' and this <span class="Italic">śaṅkha</span> is in their Deity worship? It is contradictory." But because it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> you have to accept. This is Vedic injunction. You cannot argue. There is no question of arguing. Just like cow dung is the stool of an animal. Even if we touch my own stool, I take bath. But cow dung, it is said, it is pure. If there is anywhere impure, you smear the cow dung; it will be pure. Now, you can argue that "It is stool of an animal. How it becomes pure?" This argument will not... So Vedic knowledge means don't argue. You have to accept it. <span class="Italic">Acintyaḥ khalu ye bhava na tas tarkena yojayet.</span> Things... There are many things which is beyond your perception, so you have to accept the Vedic injunction. Then you are right. So if the Vedic injunction is: "In such and such moment you take a bath in the Ganges; you become purified," you take it. There is no question of argument. That is faith. Now faith must be there. <span class="Italic">Vedo-praṇihito dharmaḥ. Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) The real purport of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Then it is successful. (Hindi) If you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says this is the purpose: <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.

He is chastising like that. So if you have got other purpose, that means you come to this group. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtino mūḍhā narādhamāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> So about (Hindi) Ramakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) But why do you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> You are free to do whatever you like. That freedom is given.

But when you speak of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then you speak what Kṛṣṇa wants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (7):</span> You should take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. You explain it but not interpret it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You can explain it in the language which people can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Explanation also not very much required because the explanation is already there, and we are not so intelligent that we can explain. But we take it, the words of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">. </span> If we see that one is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he comes to this group: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, narādhamāḥ</span> and <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> That's all. This is our conclusion. We are fools and rascal. We take the words of Kṛṣṇa. He cannot surrender to Kṛṣṇa on account of <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina. Kṛti</span> means he's doing something meritorious-but for bad purpose, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> He is taxing his brain to do something, but against the will of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> The purpose of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, or God. But if you are deviating them to become atheists, <span class="Italic">narādhamāḥ,</span> then what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> preaching? You preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. So they take the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for serving their purpose. Somebody was telling me that Dr. Radhakrishnan said that "If you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as..., Kṛṣṇa as God...," something like that, that they deny that Kṛṣṇa is God. This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> preaching. God is speaking Himself-<span class="Italic">bhagavān uvāca.</span> Vyāsadeva (Hindi). Vyāsadeva... Who can be better scholar than Vyāsadeva? <span class="Italic">Vidvān.</span> He is recognized <span class="Italic">vidvān.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">svayam evātmanātmānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vettha tvaṁ puruṣottama<br class="calibre2"/>bhūta-bhāvana bhūteśa<br class="calibre2"/>deva-deva jagat-pate</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitram</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> If we accept <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtam,</span> as it is, then we benefited, and if we do not accept in that way, then it is <span class="Italic">naṣṭaḥ. Sa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> Then it is being spoiled. And what benefit you will get with spoiled thing? As soon as you interpret it is spoiled, immediately spoiled. So what benefit will be derived from the spoiled things? And that is being done. Don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, don't believe in the words of Kṛṣṇa, and if I am preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> what is the benefit? It is spoiled? So if you distribute some spoiled food, it will increase food poison. That is going on. Instead of taking benefit from a first-class food, if you distribute a spoiled, then there will be food poisoning. That is being done. In India every home knows <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And because it is spoiled now there will be food poisoning. They are denying the existence of God. God is speaking-Bhagavān <span class="Italic">uvāca</span>-and they are now..., don't.... They are not believing in the existence of God. "God? Where is God?" Science. This is going on. If we speak of God, then we are "primitive." And up-to-date? "I am God; you are God." This is up to date. And if we say, "Now, God is Kṛṣṇa. You worship Him. You become devotee," this is primitive. And these Americans, although they are up to date, they have accepted it, my word. I presented them that Kṛṣṇa is God. They have accepted. This is their qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have told them that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord, and they have accepted. This is my magic, and this is their magic. That's all. You ask them if I did any magic with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (10):</span> This is magic itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, it is magic. It is magic undoubtedly. But I never created any gold or some other... And neither I do know it, how to do it, although there is no scarcity of gold in my pocket. I started this business with forty rupees. So I'll go to take massage. Thank you very much. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">...prasāda.</span> Show. Show the film. You are going to show?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Haridāsa took the projector, so I don't know when it's coming.</div>
