<div class="Heading">Room Conversation with Krishna Tiwari<br class="calibre2"/>--<br class="calibre2"/>May 22, 1973, New York</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Proper. Kanpur proper.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes. We were originally from a village, but we're living in Kanpur now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kanpur. It's a big city.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Industrial city.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> My name is Krishna Tiwari.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tiwari.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh. In Kanpur I had an old friend-he was just like my father-Tiwari. Very rich man. They have got their temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Which place? I probably know it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In Kanpur there is a big temple that belongs to the Tiwari family. It is famous temple. Many people go there to visit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I haven't lived there too long. Lucknow, we came to Lucknow, and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The temple is very old temple. So the proprietors of the temple are <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas,</i> Tiwari. So the eldest member, old Mr. Tiwari, was a very nice, great devotee. At home he had Deity, Rukmiṇī-Kṛṣṇa. He was worshiping at home Rukmiṇī-Kṛṣṇa, Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Mr. Tiwari is a well-known scientist. Biolo... Biologist?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Molecular biology?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Studying at U. C..., University of California at Irvine.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know how famous, but... (laughs).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> Studying biology and molecular biology. You were in University of Southern California before, right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, University of California to Los Angeles. UCLA.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So:</div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="Conversation">So biology... Biology means the scientist dealing in living entities?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So I don't think your science has reached to the point to find out the measurement of the living entity.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that is very true.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That is very true. That is very true.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But we get information that there is a measurement. <i class="calibre3">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya, śatāṁśaḥ sādṛśātmakaḥ</i> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]. The tip of the hair you divide into one hundred parts, and take that part, again divide into one hundred parts, that is the measurement. That is one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. How far do you agree with this?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know. (laughs) I don't know what you mean by that, but of course it is very true that we do not know much about life, and scientists are the first to agree to that, that we know very little.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is real scientist.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But the question is, on the left hand... Of course, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of many scientists, there is no difference between a scientist or a common man or a religious man. Both..., all these people are trying to find out about their environment. So are the religious men. They want to find out more about themselves, about the nature they live in. They want to know more about it. They want to find out why they're here, how are they to live in this world, and so I do not think there is any difference between the two.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, there cannot be difference.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes. And the only difference is that where the scientist deals with the phenomena of nature and wants to show it to others. In a strict sense he can tell how he (indistinct) better; others can go and say it. Sometimes it is very hard, I think, for all these reasons, for the religious leaders to do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So as so far the differences, there is no difference, because just like this body: the body has got different parts-the fingers, the hands, the eyes, the legs, so many different-but the whole purpose is to serve the body. Either with the finger or eyes or hands or legs, the whole purpose is centered on the soul of the complete whole body. Similarly, <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> says that whatever you may-you may be scientist, you may be philosopher, you may be an engineer, you may be a poet, you may be sociologist, politician, whatever you may be-their purpose should be <i class="calibre3">avicyutaḥ arthaḥ. Avicyutaḥ</i> means infallible purpose. <i class="calibre3">Avicyutaḥ arthaḥ kavibhih nirūpitaḥ.</i> "It has been decided by great learned scholar," says "all of them should be engaged in glorifying the Supreme." <i class="calibre3">Avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam.</i> The scientists, from their angle of vision, should describe the glory of the Lord: how this biology is working by the manipulation of the Supreme Lord. Similarly chemists, physicists, engineers, politicians, there are different departments, but all of them should join together, congregation, and from their different scientific point, angle of vision, they should glorify the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like I was speaking that the measurement of the living entity is such and such. So how God has become so small? <i class="calibre3">Aṇor aṇīyān mahato mahīyān</i>. This is... This we can simply imagine: one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair. I don't think any scientist can have any measuring instrument.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I think that can be measured.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I think they can measure that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How think?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It can be measured.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It can be measured?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It can be measured; otherwise how it is said?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Very easily measured.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah! It can be measured, but they say there is no soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Scientists say there's no soul?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Because they don't know how to look for it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore, how they'll measure? That way it is impossible for them to measure.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They can't find it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They cannot find it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But nobody else has.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Nobody else has found it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. We, I said, this is the measurement.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But since nobody else has found it...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Nobody else has found it, that is different thing, but the measurement is there in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How to measure it then?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How to measure, that is a different thing, but the measurement is there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> What is the measurement?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The one ten-thousandth part of the tip of the hair.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well that's very easy to measure.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So why don't you find it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But that's probably the reason. Nothing is there, just a number, because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> This is just a number, because one-thousandth part of hair is just a big number that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not one thousandth. One ten-thousandth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That doesn't matter. You can make it one millionth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How's that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It will be a measure of a distance, which is very easy. That cannot be a source.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So... No. That cannot be so easy. It is definitely said, <i class="calibre3">jīvaḥ bhāgasya vijñeyaḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Jīva</i> means solo, soul. Soul's measurement is given there in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah, but what are the... This is the... I don't know. This is the measurement, one thousandth of a...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> One ten-thousandth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...of a tip of hair?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that is... I don't understand that, because that will be, at that time I think it was all right, because people thought nobody could measure one thousandth, ten-thousandth of the tip of a hair.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I, we don't say people could not measure. People could measure. People measured; therefore it is, the measurement is given there. It is not that people could not measure. People measured it, definitely, and then gave it, "This is the measure."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay, so what you are trying to say? What symbolically it means, very small. Is that what it means? Is that what it means?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Very small..., that small part is there in every body. The soul is there. Now, they, without finding it, they say soul is <i class="calibre3">nirākāra;</i> there is no measurement. That is my point. I say there is <i class="calibre3">ākāra,</i> form.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> There is a form of soul, according to you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, yes. But they say there is no form. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, they don't know probably, at this moment. But I don't..., I..., we have trouble, at least I have trouble, in understanding whether anybody else knows about soul. According to you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, so far we are laymen, we have no instrument to measure. We simply hear from the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> and we try to perceive, that's all. But there <i class="calibre3">is</i> something. That measurement very, may be very, very small, but there is the substance. That is our point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right. But, I mean, with due respect to <i class="calibre3">śāstras</i>, after all, in my opinion <i class="calibre3">śāstras</i> are written by very intelligent people, and how so ever intelligent they would have been five thousand years ago, they could not have...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Or ten thousand?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. You cannot calculate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How... Well, this is a different game then.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. We have got... Because this, if we take on the strength of <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> we understand that after the birth of Brahmā... Brahmā created this universe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Lord Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But, uh, Brahmā's one day you cannot calculate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes. I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So now, at the present moment, we are in one day's..., Brahmā's one day we have passed only half.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Because in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> it is said <i class="calibre3">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 8.17]<i class="calibre3">.</i> So one <i class="calibre3">yuga</i> is calculated to be forty-three <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of years. Now...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That is also 4.3 million years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That is 4.3 million.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, and multiplied by 1000.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> OK, we've got 4.3 billion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is, that is the duration of daytime, one daytime of Brahmā, and similarly calculate night, similarly you calculate, that is twenty-four hours, one day and night. Similarly, you calculate one month.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah, I understand that, Swamiji, but uh...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In this way he lives for one hundred years, according to these calculations.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I can understand that, but, see, we do know. We do know the age of the earth, and we know better than anybody else does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How can you know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, we know. We know our own measurements, which are very reliable. Different people will come up with the same number, and we do not have to depend upon any, you know, round-about answer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, we have to depend...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, we don't.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You theories changes every year.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No... Well it changes (laughter), because it is very...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore we have to depend.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. Change is the law of nature. Change is the law of nature. Change...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> "Change is the law of nature," that's fine...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> And therefore...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...but one should know the whole duration of change. Just like we know that sunrise, from the morning 'till evening, there are so many changes, but I know what is that changes. That is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That is true, but you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you cannot say that "I know seventh year. I do not know what is going to happen ninth, eighth year."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, that is not the point. Point is that..., point is how to, how long this earth where we all live... Now we're talking about only this earth. How long this earth, we know, existed?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I'm not talking of the earth. I'm talking of the whole universe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right. Well, we'll talk about one object first, before we talk about universe next. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means you are not in the knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. But some of you, I mean, you want to talk about something, you want to start from something which is easy to comprehend and go further. How is it...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, the whole universe is one unit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I agree with philosophy...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you study my whole body, you cannot begin studying my nails.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But you have to study nails.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That we, that will include.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But, if you study my body, you have to study the whole body, not my nails or my hair.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, we have to start somewhere.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. That is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> The scientific process.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Scientific process, you begin studying... Suppose you are studying biology, you begin from hair, do you mean to say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes, but something I..., can I have my some doubts?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, first of all you answer me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah, I answer you because, uh...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That because you are studying my body you begin studying from my hair?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Some place, some place. It is hair, eyes, ears, someplace.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You think that is, uh, scientific?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Scientists will study... If they want to study a body, they study first outside, looking at what they can learn. Then after sometime it is stopped. Then one has to go inside.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, that's all right. So our point of view is when we study the body, we study first of all the soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But how we know about soul?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We know from the Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah, well somebody said there is a soul, but the question is, unless we all realize, and there is a way of...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We realize, everyone realize. As soon as the soul goes away, your body is lump of matter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, well (laughs), this is just dead. I mean, I don't know whether soul went away or not. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You don't know, but I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that's your belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No belief. I'm taking...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That's your belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I'm taking my...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It's my belief too that there's a soul (laughing), but I, scientifically I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Your, your, your belief is also based on some scientific data.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. No. Beliefs can be anything. But I can believe he's out to kill me. He can believe I'm a bad man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Belief has no foundation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Not necessarily foundation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Belief, belief is there. Fact is not belief. Fact is fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well fact has to be established.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Established? Is established. I say, I say that this is the distinction between dead man and living man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Will that extend to animals also?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyone. Anyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> According to our Hindu philosophy, I understand everything has a soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, yes. Everything. Everybody has a soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that makes me doubtful, because if I go into my laboratory and I can create as many souls as I like. I can breed animals, as many as them I like.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You cannot create. The souls are already there. You can find out...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well I..., then I'm putting a lot of pressure on God. Every time I make lot of rats, I'm asking for rat souls.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Rat has soul, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I know, but that's... Why, why then I can do it? When I can, or when I want them to be here, they will be here, not on the will of God. According to our concept of soul...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> If he's in the laboratory, and he's breeding rats, he's making rats have sex life and have babies, then he is controlling the souls of those rats.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He is not controlling. He is controlling the body.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, so body has soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> So I'm controlling the soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No? I'm making them come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. You cannot, you can..., you cannot control the soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I understand that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Otherwise... Otherwise, when the soul is gone from the body...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...you could replace one soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that's true. I mean that, I, uh, if you go... But my point is that the rat has a soul, and if God has something to do with the soul, then I should have no control of it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Apart from God. Apart... We're not going to God. Just like here...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay. Let's talk about soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are studying the hair. Your point is you're studying... Soul is the part of God, <i class="calibre3">mamaivāṁśo<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 15.7<span class="Italic">]</span><i class="calibre3">.</i> God says, "The soul is My part and parcel."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So first of all you study the part. What is the deficiency in the dead body? Have you studied it? That he's a dead body.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are biologist.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> When the body is dead, what thing is missing? Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> The body gets dead because every reaction comes to equilibrium.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (to Śyāmasundara) What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Every reaction, chemical reaction, comes to a standstill.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How? How is this?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How it comes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I think everyone understands that neither the reaction goes this way or that way. Things do not happen. And there's not one thing which controls it. There are millions of, you know, variables in it. There are lots of variables.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Going back to your example about rats...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Uh huh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...if I give you... You say you are creating rats. I give you this plant, can you create a rat from it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. That is transformation of matter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Well, that's, that's what creation means. If I give you nothing, can you create rat from it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So all you're doing is playing with established laws of nature...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...to create rats.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So you're not creating anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. Not..., I'm not..., I'm perpetuating it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You're not...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> At my will.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, you have given..., you're given a will to perpetuate...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...to, to change a few things.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Ah huh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> A few things. You cannot perpetuate a rat out of that matter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Of course not. Of course not. Nobody else can.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So, and all you can do is study that established law of nature by perpetuation of rats.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah but, yeah but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And that law of nature, Srila Prabhupāda is saying...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...is my, is under my control.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> No, it's not under your control.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I can change a rat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> That as much as you go along with that law of nature...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. No. For example we have found out the law of nature, yes. That is always the law of nature, and that is supreme. That I agree. But, but I can manipulate that law of nature as today, not me, with the help of all other scientists, which nobody else could do ever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And your manipulation is within that law of nature. Your manipulation fits within that law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Of course. Of course, I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And your manipulation, your intelligence...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore you cannot manipulate the law of nature. You are under the law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> You can't bring a dead body back to life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yes. But on other hand, on the other hand...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So let's go from there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> That's the limit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then why don't you cannot bring the dead body into life?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't think this is the point of argument, because I have, I have already, I have already agreed that the body...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, this is, this is the point, this is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, no, wait, listen, because the point is this. I agree that the living gets dead and no science can revive it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore, what is your science?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Fine. But what I'm saying is that when the question of soul is something which is not at the moment visible to us or anybody. There is no indication that there is soul, because if there is soul in everything, I would imagine that that will not be controllable under laboratory conditions. If soul made us, then we should not be able to make differences amongst us. If, if the soul was the prime force, and was important force, then such differences of very magnified nature as exists between one species, between the same species, for example human beings, or between the rats. They will not be under the control of the human beings. One could make rats with white eyes, same rat can be bred and made with blue eyes. Or rat can be made white to black. Now these knowledge, this knowledge which man has achieved by studying the law of nature would never have arrived if we just believed in total something which has been said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> What..., what good are blue-eyed rats?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that is a different point. (laughter) What good is life? What good is anything? But that, that point is out of the question.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You're not creating anything new.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I never said I did create anything new, but I changed those recognized things at will.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Within the laws of mutations.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes, at will, at will, made by my own, which, which God...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> No. No. That will is not your own.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, sure it is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It is not.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Sure it is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It is limited. You... Can you will to jump up, go to another star?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. No. We don't know yet, that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So you don't know so many things.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Of course. I agree that in the first place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But we know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. That's the difference. (laughter) What we do not know, we are ready to agree that we don't know. The trouble comes when people know nothing and they say they do know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, we know. Now why..., how do you say no? We know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. This is your belief, and I'm not...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is not belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You can believe that too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I believe too, but this is... Belief, as somebody's belief. Say I may believe so many things, as you do, as Swamiji does, as everybody else does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is your explanation between dead body and living body?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> As I said, you see, it's a very complex thing, and I would not say something that I know from which probably I don't know. What we can measure in a dead body is that we see many things, you know. Things, say organs are not working...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Apart from the soul, how, what is your explanation of this dead body?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> We point that the organs get diseased, reactions do not take place as they do, and the nature of, law of nature takes over. We are the great believers of law of nature, better than, than religious people. We believe law of nature more than anybody else does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> But you think you can control the law of nature?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I think so. I think so. This, this is the great...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Beyond the law of nature or within the law?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Within the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Within the law of nature. Therefore you can never control it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Why not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Within it, you're controlling it within it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So, what is control there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that's what, we are doing it. Nobody else has told us to do it. We found it out. Nobody told us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> That, that is within it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Within it. I agree. We are all the subject of law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> We, we... Exactly. When you say "we", you are also within it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Of course I am.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> All right. Let's go beyond this, and see what is beyond this, and that's what Swamiji...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Beyond nobody knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> He knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, beyond, therefore... No, no. Beyond... You see, as you say that you are within the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yes, I agree. We all of us are.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, somebody must be above law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Not necessarily.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, must be. Otherwise there cannot be law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, law or not, the ones which we need reading the books or administration, these are not those laws.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, no, just like...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> He means the word law? What does it mean?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like, just like we are within the state law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So there is somebody above the state laws; otherwise how the state laws is made?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I don't know which, somebody, in which sense we try to imagine it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why not imagine it? As soon as you say law, there must be law-giver.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I agree with that, but when you say law-giver, see, people get different concepts. For, for...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why different concepts? Law-giver, just like...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> For you, law-giver may be something, for me, law-giver may be something else.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, law-giver is the same thing for you and me. Just like state laws comes from the government.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Government is nothing. This comes from people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway, there is an institution which is called government. It may be people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, which is made by people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But still, you, you are not controller of the state laws.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yes, in a way I am. In a way I am.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Anyway, that is a different thing. But you cannot violate the state laws.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, well, we can avoid them. If there is a bad law, you can change.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then you'll be punished. The state laws give you law that you cannot drive your car on the left.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yeah, quite right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So if you violate, you become a criminal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right. Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore you are subordinate to the law, and the law is given by another, bigger person.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No bigger person. Now, now. These laws of nature...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How you say it is not bigger? Government is bigger than you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, no, no. That's misconception, whatsoever. As a matter of fact that's the opposite...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is obstinacy. It is obstinacy. It is obstinacy. You cannot say government is under you. You are under government.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I didn't say government was under me, but I said the laws are made for us...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why don't you try to understand? The government has given the register.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Government is nothing, government...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why do you say nothing? Why do you say nothing? You, why do you say nothing? What kind of scientist you are, you say the government is nothing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I do not know. You can say government is nothing in my room, but you'll say outside, you'll be arrested. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I can say outside too, because government is nothing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why you say government is nothing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Government is by people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. But you still you cannot say nothing. You are controlled by it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, controlled by it, by, by we, we agree with them, for our good or for what...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First of all you agree. First of all you agree...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...that government gives law and you are under the law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't think I can agree with that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is your obstinacy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. It's not obstinacy at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. You're under the law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I, I, I,...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Because they... You are assuming government is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First of all you agree, agree this principle!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How can I agree with it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is this? (laughing) He says you are not under the government of law?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That is different material.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why different matter? First of all you agree this!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How can I agree? Government is us. We govern ourselves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are. You are. You are ordered not to drive your car on the left: you <i class="calibre3">must.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I shouldn't, I shouldn't. I don't want to.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore you are under the laws of the government. Therefore you are under the laws of the government.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</b> We are under the laws of the... We are following the same laws. If you violates the laws, of course, just like Prabhupāda says, if you drive on the right side...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, in a minor sense it is true. But what I'm saying is that those laws came about because we decided it was good for us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That's what I would say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> That's another consideration. He merely wants to define the word "law." You're using the word "natural law." He wants to understand what does the concept mean, "law."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This is an example. It's just an example.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay, I agree, but so long we understand that government is not some body from up...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> In Russia it is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> In Russia it is, and I don't care for it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That you don't care for it... The point is you are under nature's law. There must be somebody who is controlling nature's law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes. It could be.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Unless you think that you have made some by your vote or something.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I never made that. No. That was the difference I was going to tell. If you'll give an example of a government, that is very different from the example of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes. No analogy is perfect. So it's more like the Russian government, let's say. Right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That government, what does it mean, "government"? Government means also a person, like president.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Here in America, the government means President Nixon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, well, okay, if you want to believe that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why not believe? It is a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't agree with it at all. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why don't you agree? Then you are madman. You are a madman. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> (laughing) No, no. I don't agree with you, Swamiji, at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no... Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't agree. Because I don't think, I don't think that some, it is the government.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This is, this is, you know this is still going off the point. The point is still being made that you've already agreed with that you are under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> And that you did not take a hand in determining these laws.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay, I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> He agrees that he's under the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But I do not agree with some of your government orders.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> That's fine.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now the fact, first of all, we are under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> All right...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And the laws of nature... (break)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> From my opinion, something which I do know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But we know, we know, in this way, that Lord Kṛṣṇa says that <i class="calibre3">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 9.10], "Under My control, under My superintendence, the material law of nature is working."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I don't know who, who, who, who said that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You don't know; therefore you learn it, you learn it from <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>. You do not know that. You learn it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. I have read <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā.</i> I am aware of it. I know what is said there.</div>

<div class="Conversation">You are coming from Indian <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> family, you must know it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I know it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I have also read it. I have <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> with me, always reading...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, yes, here is the controller of the, controller of the material nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes. But who? The book... You see, the difference is philosophically. As far as the philosophy of the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> is concerned, fine. But when since we start talking about somebody controlling, and identifying somebody with somebody, I have troubles, as everybody else does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Well, no, no trouble. First of all, we have accepted that we are under the control of laws of nature. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now we say... Not we say; our Vedic literature says that there is a controller of the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I don't know about that. Maybe. Me, I don't know about that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You don't know. Why don't you know? You must know. You must know. Here it is said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I'm giving a scientific opinion, not my opinion. Scientists don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That scientists, but that the scientists are fools.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know that or that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes! They are fools.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> (laughing) We..., I don't know. Maybe. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Maybe? Yes!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, it is a fact because we are, we are arguing. We are under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And there must be one who is above the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No problem, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no problem. This is a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> We do not know for fact, and nobody else does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> See, when we do not..., we say we do not know, we are just being modest.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> But he knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know about that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> But he's trying to tell if you'll listen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I, I have heard about those things, but I just don't know about the, how to believe...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means, that means you are unbeliever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, not at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Certainly. Certainly! That you are unbeliever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Not at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> If, if he doesn't know <i class="calibre3">who</i> he is, who is controlling?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then he is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Then he is admitting that there is a controller. You admit that there is a controller, but you don't know. You're telling us that you do not see Him and you do not know Him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, you can say that. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You can not make finalize...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> My point is I don't know, and I'm not too sure you know it either. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I know. I know, because we are getting from authority of <i class="calibre3">Veda</i>. We know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> are there, but Swamiji...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are, you are, you are, you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> When I was in India, dying in smallpox, children were dying in smallpox, and we were going to all the knowledge of <i class="calibre3">Veda</i> people, and they were sending us to the temple, and we, we go and worship, and the people will die and, and they didn't tell us anything about some kind of injection which could protect it. And the scientist people who went and found out about nature, they found out something, and children are not dying anymore. They are not deformed. I know about that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have stopped the death of children?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> We haven't stopped, but we sure don't see them going because of smallpox.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Because they're all in the hospitals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Because of smallpox, we don't see them going.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> But they die.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Eventually everybody dies.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Yes. (all speak at once)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You don't know so many points. First of all this point, let us decide, that every one of us under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You can save the child for the time being by (indistinct) nature, but it is under the laws of nature, it will die. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You cannot avoid it. So everyone is under the laws the nature. Let us decide on that. Now these laws of nature, these also controlled by somebody else. As we gave the example that every individual person within a state is controlled by the laws of government or laws of king. Now it is governed by democracy. Formerly it was under the king. So king is a person. He gives the law, and under that law all citizens are controlled. This is a fact. Therefore the laws of nature is controlled by somebody, controller, and we get this information from Vedic knowledge. And practically it is so, that just by the example, law must be given by somebody. Law is not blind, or something dropped from the sky. Law is law. It is made by somebody. That is law. It is working systematically. That is law. So when there is systematic law, there is systematic law-giver, controller, supervisor, superintendent. So we are not imagining, but we'll take it from authority, Vedic information, which is accepted by a great culture, great <i class="calibre3">ācāryas,</i> great teachers. Not that I am blindly accepting, but we are in the disciplic succession in the Vedic knowledge. So from there we understand, <i class="calibre3">janmādy asya yataḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.1.1]<i class="calibre3">,</i> <i class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra. Vedānta-sūtra. Vedānta. Veda</i> means knowledge. It includes your scientific knowledge also. <i class="calibre3">Veda</i> means knowledge, and <i class="calibre3">anta</i> means ultimate. That is called <i class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</i>. In small codes, the things are given there, Vedic knowledge. Just like what is the ultimate Absolute Truth, the question, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i></span>. Brahman means absolute, the biggest. So the answer is <i class="calibre3">janmādy asya yataḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.1.1]. So that is Absolute Truth, Supreme Brahman, wherefrom everything comes. So the laws of nature comes from Him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> This is all imagination according to me. I mean it's all imagination and belief at this point to me. I mean I have no objection...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, what is the imagination? Not here, imagination. When you learn from a, a... Just like the law of gravitation, it is not imagination.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well law of gravitation, anything we know about gravity did not come from <i class="calibre3">Vedas.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not from <i class="calibre3">Veda</i>, but it comes from Mr. Newton.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes, that what I was saying...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So therefore you take the laws of gravitation from Mr. Newton.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So there is an authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well Newton was wrong in many places, although nobody is authority. Things change. I don't...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means you don't accept any authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I don't, because once you accept an authority, you are just blindly following something which may be right, which may be absolutely wrong. But you will never find it out, whether it was right or wrong. So blind faith in authority is the most mistaken path a person can ever take.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not blind faith. We don't say authority blind faith. Authority, that's not blind faith.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> And just...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, just... Suppose, to know your father, the authority is your mother. The mother says, "Here is your father." You follow blindly?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. It is a different thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Mother may say wrong.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, well, this is, this kind of examples are very...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Why not this kind of example?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> They're unreal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not unreal. The authority means you have to follow blindly. That is authority. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, no. You believe something. You, you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Believe, because it is fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> You, whenever you use word "follow," "authority," you are talking of subjugation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Yes! Yes!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> And subjugation is different than faith and belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Sub... We believe in the subjugation, because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I do not believe in the subjugation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is your madness, because you know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, no. No way, no way you can say that. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, don't be upset. You said that you are under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I am.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Therefore you are under subjugation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But, but I do not believe these kind of "authority" words.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You believe, you believe. When, when the laws of nature will force upon you death, you must believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I'm sure I will believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then why do you say that you are not obligation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, but that's not question of authority or anything...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, that is authority. We mean another...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...that's a part of the nature. Difference between...,</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...big difference between subjugative authority and being a part of the nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Subjugative, when you are forced to become old, when you are forced to become diseased, you are under subjugation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Mistake. Not forced. It's automatic, it's, it's just a chain. It's a growth into. It's a factor; it's no force.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That automatic means just like you become criminal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That, that's the way progress, I'm a part of it. I'm not under or over anybody, and no one is over, under, or above me. You are not under me. You are not over me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> You're under nature's law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right, we all are. You, me, Swamiji, you, all of us are.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Exactly. Exactly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Neither you are above me, nor you are below, nor I am above you. I may have respect for you, because I, on my own, believe that you are respectable. That is entirely different thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> That's up to you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Then authority. That's what I'm saying. This is up to me. But authority and subjugation are, are the two things which will not come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It's a matter of your choice. Accepting...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It's a matter of personal choice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you are not under subjugation, that does not authority?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I'm no, I'm no, I'm no subjugation to anyone. I'm a part of the nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How is that you're not...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> If nature moves, I move with it. If the nature makes me old, I get old.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have here subjugation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I am no... I'm a part of a... Nature is changing too. Nature is nothing which is, which is static.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Nature is not changing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, sure it is changing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not changing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, my belief is it's changing, and even Lord Kṛṣṇa says it changes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I think He does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Nature is changing...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Ever-changing, ever-changing world is the theme of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> There's always winter, there's always summer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, and things have changed, much, much more than you have observed just by winter and spring, and the change, the change of the world, change of the nature is the Lord in <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> philosophy itself, and I'm a great believer in <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> philosophy, but I just don't buy subjugation or authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Then how can you..., then you say, you say you can determine the age of the earth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I have not determined. I mean, thousands of scientists have combined.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> You say you believe, you believe in some of the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I believe that number very well. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Then you believe in authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, because I can make my own calculation using his things.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> But you said that earth changes so much.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It does. It's ever-changing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Then how can you measure it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That you..., there are ways to do it. I mean, that, the what is earth today will not be tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Measurements are blunt.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh of course.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Can I, can I summarize to you what our position on authority is? What we're talking about is that simply you're saying we both agree that there is a very beautiful set-up here. It's not accidental set-up. (indistinct) intelligent laws of nature. We both agree that there must be something beyond it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You agree. Now you don't know beyond that. You have not... You say "I don't have time," or somehow...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. I have lot of time, just I can't find.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Exactly, exactly. You made your choice not to go after, or you cannot find it, you say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, that's, that's not... That's your words. That's not my words. My desire is to find more, much, much more than you can place this. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Fine. But about that person, you see, you can find and find and find. You've got an outlet. You can get his hair and analyze. Each hair you can see millions of atoms. You can count the atoms in each hair. You can go further and further and further. But if you don't know that is an elephant, that's...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, we have to know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So we're talking about the whole, which includes, includes that creator.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Now, when...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I think we don't have much difference of opinion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And we go, to find about that creator, we go to the source of authority...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...which we know, this is the only process to find a creator, because we are...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How you know that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> ...His subordinate...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How you know that about?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Because we are His subordinate. Now, and you will know, if you follow the process, you will know too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You have to accept one by one. You have to accept first of all that He is the authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, how can you accept somebody's authority without knowing them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Like your mother. He gave the example.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. I believed in her. That's all I said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> If she says... If she says he's my father, I believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> You think she's trying to cheat you?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I'm not. That's why I believe her. The question of authority does not come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> So you have to believe there is an alternative beyond and above this law of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Believe? I always said from the very beginning, beliefs are entirely different thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And you have to understand where does this information come from. This doesn't come accidentally. It comes from the source of information. And this source of information we call the <i class="calibre3">Vedas.</i> It is not an accidental literature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The <i class="calibre3">Veda</i> means knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It's knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Knowledge coming from, just like you were talking about.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> And where is it coming from? It's coming, it's coming from the source.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I don't, I think we have a, just a matter of words. You said knowledge is coming from source. I think knowledge is coming from people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> How could you know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Your knowledge is always changing, just like the Carbon 14 test. You say... You might has said a few months back, "Yes, I believe the earth is this old," and now you have to say, "No, I believe now the earth is half that old." So your knowledge is constantly changing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Because that's better and better.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Better and better. Have you improved the world? Do you think you've made one improvement in the world?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Nobody else has. We have made better than what others, everybody else combined, Christ and everybody else combined did, and Lord Kṛṣṇa included.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> How do you measure that improvement?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, this is another point. First of all you must settle up this. (laughter). First of all we must settle up this fact, that we are all under the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I agree, Swamiji, completely.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now the point is, we, we say the laws of nature is also given by somebody else. That is our point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Which probably I have nothing to add to.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes, but my one...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, what is that person, that is another thing, but simply let us agree that we are under the laws of nature, and laws of nature is also controlled by somebody.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, we can say that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is our point. That is our point. Now, who is that person, or what is that substance which is controlling the law of nature, that is not yet known to the science.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. But we, either you say "believe" or you know, we know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well that's okay. Okay, because everybody is free to believe in it, but one cannot say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is the point. You don't believe that; we believe that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, that is not true. I didn't say that. I agreed with it. But I do not know who the person is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...when I will have...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I don't say who, but you have to believe that there is a person and there is a superior authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Person, I don't think so. It's not from person. Not in my opinion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Or not person; something, something superior to these laws of material nature. That you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is our point. That is our point. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But that is, this is again a conjecture which probably everybody is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Whatever it may be, you have to accept. We are under the laws of nature, and laws of nature is controlled by something superior.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That's fine. I don't think we have any disagreement on that point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. Let us agree to that point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Let us agree to that point. Now what is that something, that remains, for the time being. I may say "I know"; you may say "I don't believe in it." That is a different thing. But there must be something above the laws of nature which is controlling. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If we agree to that, then there is no disagreement. Let us stop here. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay. I mean that is, but that is very obvious to everybody. I mean this is nothing, this is no...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now our, our preaching is, "Here is the controller." Now, you may take it or not take it. That is different thing. But we say "Here is the controller."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Only difference of opinion is this, that, uh, one... Oh, you say or I say, it doesn't matter. It's not reflected to you. Anybody who says that they know about God, they have actually no, no, no, no way to prove any way, one way or the other.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. We don't know by your process.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> By any process.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Your process. Your process is, you are trying to ascend. But we are taking knowledge from directly God. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> That's where my trouble is, and I...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, your trouble must be there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Because you're godless.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, no. Not true.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is your problem.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Not true. Not true.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is your trouble.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, no... Okay, go on saying like that. Fine. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, because you are godless in this sense: because you are born in India, born in a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> family, and you do not believe Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh. I do not believe, but uh, I do believe that God is, but I do not understand whether the... (indistinct) God or not. I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You do not understand, that is your godlessness. That is your godlessness, because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, that's not my godlessness at all. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Please listen while he explains the process of how to know God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Brāhmaṇa</i> means one who knows the Brahman<i class="calibre3"> Brahma jānāti iti brāhmaṇa.</i> So at least you are not a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa,</i> because you do not know the Brahman<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I do not believe in classes anyway.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> It's all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. So there, that is your defect. One has to become a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i> One has to. But you're deviated from <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I'm glad I did. (laughs) I'm really happy I did. I can assure you, Swami.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> If I meet God, I'll tell Him I'm glad I did. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. The demons always say like that. (disciples laugh). The demons say always like that. That's is the fashion of the demons.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, it's not true. (laughing) You know, Swamiji, what I am telling you, it's not true, because I know I'm a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa's</i> son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I know a lot about...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You are.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> A lot about reading <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> myself...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have become a demon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> From <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> you have become a demon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I have not become demon, and God knows it. I am much more better man, right now...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Demons always know better than God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Is that right? I don't know better than God. Oh, I never said that. What I'm saying is God knows I'm not a bad man. I'm not a demon. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Demon's position is always to challenge God that "I know better than you."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I never said that. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is demonism. That is demonism.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, Swamiji, you did not hear me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I hear, I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I said that God knows I'm not a demon. I did not say I am better than God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Can we hear what he knows, what is his knowledge? What he thinks is his knowledge? What do you know...?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Can I say about my concept of God and philosophy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> No, no, no, not that. That's speculation. Let's hear what you think...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, it's better speculation than yours. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> Let's hear what you know through your scientific... You say you only accept knowledge which is scientifically verifiable.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I never said that. I was giving you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> One thing is, that he has accepted that there is a controller of the nature. Now, what is that controller you do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's the point. So we know. That is the difference. You believe me or not, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay. All right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I say that controller is Kṛṣṇa. Now you may disagree with me. But I have got evidence from the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> that Kṛṣṇa is accepted by all <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i> in India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I accept Him too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, that he is the supreme controller. I have got that authority-Rāmānujācārya, he is a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>. Madhvācārya, he is a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He is a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa. </i>They're born in <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> family. Śaṅkarācārya, he was a <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I know all of them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So all of them have agreed. So in my background, we have got so many authorities, but when you say, you have no background. That is difference between you and me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Swamiji, our <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> also say that "You seek and you'll find." And, and, and "The person who seeketh himself..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> "...will find, will have a better chance of finding Me."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Where is that said?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We don't agree to that. We don't agree.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Where is that said?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, I'll show you many books where, where the philosophy has been...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now we are talking of <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā.</i> Can you say any quotation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I do not follow them by quotation, by quotation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then don't say <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>. Don't say our <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>. You don't believe in <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>. You do not know <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>. Therefore don't say our <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>. You'll say Indian scientific point of views. Don't say your <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Say what you have found through your scientific process. Tell us what knowledge is. Tell us what..., how things are working. What is the, what is the process of scientific...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How the nature, law of nature is being controlled? Where is your scientific...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I, I already agreed, and all scientists agree that they know nothing about it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all. That you don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> So then your process is imperfect. You admit. We're saying that there's a process which is perfect, and it's a process of receiving knowledge which is absolute, that is descending, and receiving that with a submissive attitude. And you're saying that by your sensuous endeavor with your different machines and instruments, you can ascend to the Absolute Truth. But the symptom of a person who is in knowledge is that he's satisfied, he's peaceful within, and we can understand that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness society is developing, is helping living entities, people, become satisfied within by receiving knowledge and actually coming to, to understand themselves and what's around them and so forth, whereas, let me ask you, how many people have actually come to this stage of peacefulness and knowledge, of being freed from the need for intoxication and so many different things, by your scientific method? In other words, has this process helped you to be actually filled with knowledge and bliss, or has it simply sent you into more questioning and more doubt until you come to a point of what we were discussing the other day, the Heisenberg's theory of uncertainty? Ultimately you come to the theory of uncertainty. So we're saying, when you come to this point, then you may as well just relax and try to have a submissive attitude, or any scientist, and try to receive knowledge which is descending.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Another, another thing is, he says, he says that he does not know what is there beyond this material nature. But he's still satisfied with that imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> That's right. You should not be satisfied with that imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Wait a minute.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> To be satisfied with imperfect knowledge is the qualification of an animal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Correct. But this was your words. It were not mine. I didn't say that I was satisfied. You presumed I was satisfied.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Yes, yes. You said that we know artificially; we don't know philosophy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I never said that we're not trying to find out.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> All right, then, and you have tried, and you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, we are still trying to... You have to try very hard to find out these things. My question is, when I say-wait a minute, let me talk something. When I say I do not know, that does not necessarily mean that others know. And you are taking this (indistinct) point. I am saying in my humbleness that I do not know, and you come up, "Well, I know that." Because I don't know, you are suppose to know. That's not true. I just say you don't know either. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, that... But you cannot say, also, because you do not know, others do not know. You cannot say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. I never said that. I don't..., I didn't say that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> You did. You just did.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, but you'll come back and tell me that "I know." Then I cannot believe you that because I said I don't know, you have to know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> "I, I know" means I know from the authority, who knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How? Which authority is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That, I say, I present this, <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> authority. You don't...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> (indistinct) with those.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You do not believe in the <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i>, that is a different thing. But I am saying I know from the authority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I have seen that. I have seen, I have lived in India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is my position.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I have lived in everywhere. If <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> were all that great and we have followed <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> for thousand of years...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. You might have...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...look what it has done to the country.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You might have faith...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> (indistinct) is still there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> are still...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> In what situation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is not what situation. It is what situation for you. You do not believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> (indistinct) is doing much better.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But <i class="calibre3">Vedas,</i> authorities have not been accepted by all the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>, by the, all the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i>, all great personalities in India? That is our authority. Now, you don't believe in authority. That is you have become deviated from <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i>. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, if you want to say that point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> This is not my opinion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That we have got our authority. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> This is not my opinion, because I look with eyes open; I make my own mind.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This opinion, it is your opinion. Because you are Indian, I am also Indian. I believe you don't believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Sure, I do not believe.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So it is your opinion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> I do not believe in the strict following of every word...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right, that is your, that is your point of view, but that is not our point of view.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, right, we disagree on that one.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara:</b> You said once, in a court of law, if there are two points of view at the final judgment, it has to be judged by the results of which point of view. So if you, if you judge by the results of our process and his process which people are..., have attained to some kind of perfect understanding of themselves, some kind of satisfaction with life, you have to point to our process and say that ours gets the balance of favorable opinion, because in your process, no one has been made happy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> How does say that in your process, anybody has been made happy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Everyone who follows Vedic injunctions, they're happy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> You ask me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> You ask me. I'm very happy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you are happy with imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, no. (laughing) Again it's the same thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You said, you said... No. You are happy with your imperfect education of an animal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Everybody is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Imperfect knowledge and happiness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Only perfect can be then your superpower, which you're talking about. You cannot be perfect either.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. no. I am not perfect, but I am following the perfect. That is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Yeah, well, superpower, everybody is following a superpower, everybody else...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is... No. You have no such power. You have no such superpower.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I have no such superpower, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You say that you do not know anything beyond this material knowledge. That you do not know. Therefore you do not know what is that superpower, which is controlling. But I know the superpower.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, that's my question. I don't know whether you know that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> So, you should not make up the conclusion that just because you don't know, that someone else also doesn't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No, I agree with you completely, but my point of this is that this is the difference between religious and scientific approach of finding the superpower. When science finds...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This is not religious!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Whatever it is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is not faith.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Whatever.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is fact. It is science.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Science. It is this kind of science then, because there is no way to prove it. When a person finds...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There is proof. There is proof.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...anywhere in the world...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You don't say there is no proof.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> ...in science, you can do the same thing in your place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. There is proof. There is proof. Because, because the laws of nature is being controlled, that is the proof there is somebody controlling. That is the proof.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, okay, suppose we grant that. Suppose we grant that, that that is the case, then what we do about it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So that, you do not know that. We know that. That is our difference.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Okay. Suppose we believe that this is the case. Then we do about it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That, then our knowledge is perfect and your knowledge...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Then sit and just request him to do something.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> No. The process is given. If, he, he...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just... We, the difference is that your process is imperfect because you do not know exactly who is the controller of the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But nobody else does know either.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I, nobody... I say know, still you say nobody knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Oh, yeah, I agree. That's your belief, but I don't think you know that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why belief? I say your belief also. That there is no controller there, that is also your belief.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> No. There is a controller. I say you don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why you are giving so much importance to your method of understanding?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> (laughs) Because there is only one each of us can do.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is (indistinct). So if you give so much importance to your method of understanding, why don't you give importance to our method of understanding?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> Well, I haven't seen the results of...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Your method is imperfect. I have seen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Krishna Tiwari:</b> But others is more imperfect.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
