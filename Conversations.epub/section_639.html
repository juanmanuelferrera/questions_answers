<div class="Normal-Level">(Predominantly Hindi throughout)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian gentleman, probably Yogi Bhajan):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) We have got a picture of Māyāpur. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> From the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) (Conversation continues in Hindi, with second Indian gentleman also. Seem to be discussing Prabhupāda's various centers around the world.) They have lost interest, the younger generation.... (Conversation continues between three)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> As far as Golden Temple is concerned, that is their result... (Hindi) They have lot of temples and a lot of good word, (?) and let them learn to by themselves. (Hindi) I have no time to spoil(?) it. He is great. That is what I want to learn, how he can do that. And I don't believe that. My territory they define. It starts... It ends at the Suez Canal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suez Canal means whole Mediterranean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> Yes, Mediterranean. And there I have up to Singapore, Malaysia. So I said, "Well, you have forgotten writing down Burma, and you never wrote a word about India, so good-bye." That is not our territory. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> (Hindi) We have the best attorney here in this area, and you are having a trouble with this temple. If you... Somebody if you can call, because in this area he is the best law attorney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take the address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have their phone number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> We won that... Recently he won a very big case. This is our daily fight, but it comes on you sometimes. We fight it daily. We fight before it happens to us. If I was to buy this temple I would have insured the title in a suit case, and I would have filed the suit myself, but on the neighborhood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, well they had approved our moving in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> That is something later, but I have talked with. That is simple. I would have sued this area. I have heard that I can be damaged, I would have sued them five million dollars, all this area, vicinity. I could have proved it because I would have done it. Moment they would have filed the case, proof was there. I had not to prove. Their own document would have proved it. But you know that attorney they had.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian gentleman):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> So I think here in this case, because this is one of the typical case. Their plea is very simple plea against which you have to come out with a very strong argument. They say it were(?) the temple, a certain frequency. You have changed the frequency, and therefore you have disturbed the environment and the ecology. I studied the entire case. I got all my information and I got it. So that's their main contention. Now what you have to prove is very ticklish. Therefore each paper must be filed very comparatively right because this is they call invocation of the zonal area. To relieve the pressure on the subsidies of the zones and that lies on a miracle(?). So if your attorney comes down the defense of it, and then you can get under Amendment One and then they can't touch you. It's a very, very good fight. We fought it. That's why... And we won it. They got us on the same point. But what we did was, we had already filed a complaint, or we knew it was going to come. That case went out of the court just like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We will consult with your attorney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> No, no, he is expert. They have figured it out. Because we are very conspicuous in this some way. You get away with things, you know, you are all right. But with us it is not "That's the man. Get him." (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have legal battles wherever we go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogi Bhajan:</span> We have a battle on every step. We wear a <span class="Italic">kapon</span> (Sikh knife), we have a battle on every step. They say, "It is a knife. You can't carry it." We fight every few steps. Social dangers, we have more social aggressive dangers than you. But if you just channel it on a patterned style, you know, pattern thirteen. Now what we fight is this fight is pattern thirteen, fight it. We go, we go through. (Hindi) (Conversation continues)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is Nanda Kumāra ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Nanda Kumāra is... Do you want to take here or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In that room. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> World Fellowship...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> World Fellowship of Religion. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Just preparing. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Good is two words, two o's. You have to be God first then to be good to anybody. (Hindi) Charity begins from home. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.</span> (Hindi) (end)</div>
