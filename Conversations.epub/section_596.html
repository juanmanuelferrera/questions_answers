<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...advises Arjuna that "I am... The body and the soul different."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> The body and soul are different, yes. So it seems to me too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. That is the beginning of spiritual education. People do not understand. I have seen many European big, big professors. They do not have any clear conception that the body and the soul, different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> It still disturbs me, of course, how the body can influence the mind so much, the mind not being the soul apparently. But I know that when I get hit on the back of the head, my mind seems to blank out. Once in judo I recall having my carotid artery pressed and consciousness left. But it was very pleasant. It was not unpleasant at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Actually soul is above intelligence. Above intelligence. Our gross senses, that is our present perception, direct. And beyond these gross senses, there is the mind. And beyond the mind, there is intelligence. And beyond intelligence, there is soul. So come to that platform requires that meditation process to make the sense activities calm and quiet, mind settle, and then come to the intelligence platform, then come to the spiritual platform.

<div class="calibre7"><div class="Verse-Text"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> </div>

<div class="Verse-Text">manasas tu parā buddhir</div>
<div class="Verse-Text">yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.42]</div>
<div class="Translation">Translation: The working senses are superior to dull matter; mind is higher than the senses; intelligence is still higher than the mind; and he [the soul] is even higher than the intelligence.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Purport: The senses are different outlets for the activities of lust. Lust is reserved within the body, but it is given vent through the senses. Therefore, the senses are superior to the body as a whole. These outlets are not in use when there is superior consciousness, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In Kṛṣṇa consciousness the soul makes direct connection with the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the bodily functions, as described here, ultimately end in the Supreme Soul. Bodily action means the functions of the senses, and stopping the senses means stopping all bodily actions. But since the mind is active, then, even though the body may be silent and at rest, the mind will act-as it does during dreaming. But, above the mind there is the determination of the intelligence, and above the intelligence is the soul proper. If, therefore, the soul is directly engaged with the Supreme, naturally all other subordinates, namely, the intelligence, mind and the senses, will be automatically engaged. In the <span class="Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad </span>there is a passage in which it is said that the objects of sense gratification are superior to the senses, and mind is superior to the sense objects. If, therefore, the mind is directly engaged in the service of the Lord constantly, then there is no chance of the senses becoming engaged in other ways. This mental attitude has already been explained. If the mind is engaged in the transcendental service of the Lord, there is no chance of its being engaged in the lower propensities. In the <span class="Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad </span>the soul has been described as <span class="Italic">mahān, </span>the great. Therefore the soul is above all-namely, the sense objects, the senses, the mind and the intelligence. Therefore, directly understanding the constitutional position of the soul is the solution of the whole problem.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">With intelligence one has to seek out the constitutional position of the soul and then engage the mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That solves the whole problem. A neophyte spiritualist is generally advised to keep aloof from the objects of senses. One has to strengthen the mind by use of intelligence. If by intelligence one engages one's mind in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, by complete surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then, automatically, the mind becomes stronger, and even though the senses are very strong, like serpents, they will be no more effective than serpents with broken fangs. But even though the soul is the master of intelligence and mind, and the senses also, still, unless it is strengthened by association with Kṛṣṇa in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is every chance of falling down due to the agitated mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. The yogic process is to control the mind. Our process is: immediately engage the mind in Kṛṣṇa, thinking of Kṛṣṇa, feeling for Kṛṣṇa, willing to act for Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will be all right. Then everything will be all right. If the mind is immediately engaged in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, then this side and that side, everything will be all right. <span class="Italic">Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayoḥ [SB 9.4.18]. Padāravindayoḥ,</span> in the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa mind is engaged. So this is our process, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma...," engaging the mind, meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the doctor was saying that he holds to the philosophy of Kant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Kant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Kant, yes. He was explaining nicely his point of view downstairs before we came up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that Kant's philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> One major difference it seems with the point of view of the eastern Indian philosophies in particular is that the soul of man does not seem to be something eternal, but it seems to be something created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Soul is part and parcel of God. As God is not created, He is creator, above creation, so the father creates a child; therefore father is above creation. So God is above creation. God created the cosmic manifestation. Before creation of this cosmic world, God was there. Therefore He is not created; He is creator of all created things. And the soul, being part and parcel of God, he is also not created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> The question that bothers me in part is then why would the soul... Because I understand your conception that the soul is part of the spiritual sky originally or part of God, and it somehow falls out of this blissful condition due to pride, much like the Christian thesis that the devil fell out of heaven due to pride. And it seems puzzling why the soul would be so silly, so foolish, so insane, as to do such a thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instead of using independence properly, when he misuses independence he falls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> I'm sorry, he what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> He falls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He falls down on account of his independence. Just like you have got independence. You are sitting here. You can go immediately. You may not like to hear me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> I wouldn't what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not like to hear me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That independence you have got. I have got also. I may not talk with you. So that independence is always there. Similarly, as part and parcel of God, the, it is the duty of the soul to be always engaged in the service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Always engaged in...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Service of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like this finger is part and parcel of my body. Whatever I am ordering, it is immediately carrying out. I say, "Make it like this." He will, it will do. So... But this is dead matter. It is acting mechanically. The brain directs immediately the finger and it acts, like machine. This whole body is just like a machine, but soul is not machine mechanical part. It is spiritual part. So therefore, as I am directing the finger, as being machine, it is working, but if somebody else, a friend or servant, I may direct him to do something, he may not do it. So when the soul misuses the independence, then he falls down. That is material life. Material life means misusing the independence of soul. Just like a son. A son's duty is to obey the father. But he may not obey. That is his madness. So when the soul, misusing the independence, becomes mad, he is sent in this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> It is puzzling to me that one would be so foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because by independence you can become foolish. Otherwise, there is no meaning of independence. Independence means you can do whatever you like. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse in the Eighteenth Chapter. That independence is there. After instructing the whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to Arjuna, Kṛṣṇa gave him the independence, "Now whatever you like, you can do." Kṛṣṇa never forced him to accept the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He gave him the independence, "Now whatever you like, you can do." And he agreed. "Yes. Now my illusion is over, I shall act as You say." The same independence. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is in the Eighteenth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Dharmādhyakṣa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">iti te jñānam ākhyātaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>guhyād guhyataraṁ mayā<br class="calibre2"/>vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>yathecchasi tathā kuru<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Thus I have explained to you the most confidential of all knowledge. Deliberate on this fully, and then do what you wish to do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now if you say, "Why the soul should become so foolish?" So that is misuse of independence. Intelligent father has got intelligent son, but sometimes he becomes a fool. So what is the reason? He is the part and parcel of the father. He should have become exactly like the father. But he does not become like the father. I have seen. In Allahabad was a big lawyer, barrister, Mr. Bannerjee. His eldest son was also barrister and his youngest son, on account of bad association, he became a <span class="Italic">ekala wala. Ekala</span> means... In India there is a carriage drawn by one horse. So he liked to be an <span class="Italic">ekala.</span> That means he fell in love, a low class of woman, and by her association, he became an <span class="Italic">ekala.</span> There are many instances. The Ajamila <span class="Italic">upakhyana.</span> He was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and then he fell down very low. So this misuse of independence is always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in our material contaminated state when we act in a foolishly or mad, then we call that <span class="Italic">tamas,</span> or our ignorance, but in the spiritual sky when the living entity is in his pure state of consciousness, what acts..., Does something act upon him to make him illusioned at that point also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Jaya-Vijaya. They committed offense. They did not allow the four Kumāras to enter. That was their fault. And the Kumāras became very sorry. Then they cursed him that "You are not fit to remain in this place." So we sometimes commit mistake. That is also misuse of independence. Or we are prone to fall down because we are small. Just like small fragment of fire. Although it is fire, it is prone to be extinguished. The big fire does not extinguish. So Kṛṣṇa is the big fire, and we are part and parcel, sparks, very small. So within the fire there are sparks, "Fut, Fut!" There are so many. But if the sparks fall down, then it is extinguished. It is like that. The fall down means material world, there are three different grades: the <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,</span> and <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> If the... Just like the spark falls down. If it falls down on dry grass, the grass becomes ablazed. So the fiery quality is still maintained, although it is fall down. On account of the atmosphere of the dry grass, it again makes another fire, and the fiery quality maintains. That is <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> And if the spark falls down on the green grass, then it is extinguished. And the dry grass, if, when the green grass becomes dry, there is chance of again coming to the blazing, but if the spark falls down in water, then it is very difficult. Similarly, the soul, when comes in the material world, there are three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> So if he contacts with <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa</span> then he is in the most abominable condition. If it falls down with <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa</span> then there is little activity. Just like they are working. And if he falls down in the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> then he at least keeps himself in the knowledge that "I am fire. I do not belong to this dull material." So therefore we have to bring him again to the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> brahminical qualification, so that he can understand <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> "I am spirit soul. I am not this matter." So then his spiritual activity begins. Therefore we are trying to bring him to the platform of <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> means to give up the business of <span class="Italic">rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa:</span> no meat-eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, so many no's, to deny him the influence of material qualities. Then, if he is situated in the <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> then he remains on the platform of... When he remains on the plat..., <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> then the <span class="Italic">rajas-tamaḥ,</span> the other base qualities, cannot disturb him. The base quality, the platform of base quality is this: illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication, gambling. So <span class="Italic">tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaṣ ca ye [SB </span>1.2.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one is free from at least to these base qualities... Base quality means <span class="Italic">kama,</span> lusty desires, and greediness. In material world, generally, they are under these base quality, means always filled up with lusty desires and not satisfied, greedy. So when we conquer over these base qualities, then we become happy. <span class="Italic">Tadā rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ kāma-lobhādayaṣ ca ye, ceta etair anaviddham.</span> When the consciousness is not influenced by these base qualities, <span class="Italic">ceta etair ana..., sthitaḥ sattve prasīdati,</span> being situated on the platform of <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> he feels happy. That is the beginning of spiritual life. When... So long the mind is disturbed by lusty desires and greediness, there is no question of spiritual life. Therefore the first business is how to control the mind so that it may not be influenced by the base quality, lusty desires and greediness. We have seen in Paris old man, seventy-five years old, he is going to the night club. Because the lusty desire is there. He pays fifty dollars for entering the club, and then he pays further for other things. So even he is seventy-five years old, the lusty desire is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Did all the souls that were in the spiritual sky fall out of the spiritual sky at once or at different times, or are there any souls that are always good, they're not foolish, they don't fall down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are... Majority, 90%, they are always good. They never fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> So we're among the 10%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Or less than that. In the material, whole material world all the living entities they are... Just like in the prison house, there are some population, but they are not majority. The majority of the population, they are outside the prison house. Similarly, majority of living being, part and parcel of God, they are in the spiritual world. Only a few falls down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Does Kṛṣṇa know ahead of time that a soul is going to be foolish and fall?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa? Yes, Kṛṣṇa may know because He is omniscient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Are more souls falling all the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all the time. But there is the tendency of fall down, not for all, but because there is independence... Everyone is not liking to misuse the independence. The same example: Just like a government constructing a city and constructs also prison house because the government knows that somebody will be criminal. So their shelter must be also constructed. It is very easy to understand. Not that cent percent population will be criminal, but government knows that some of them will be. Otherwise why they construct prison house also? One may say, "Where is the criminal? You are constructing..." Government knows, there will be criminal. So if the ordinary government can know, why God cannot know? Because there is tendency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> The origin of that tendency is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> From where does that tendency come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tendency means the independence. So everyone can know that independence means one can use it properly, one can misuse it. That is independence. If you make it one way only, that you cannot become fall down, that is not independence. That is force. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Now you do whatever you like."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa is independent, therefore the part and parcels...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Part and parcel must have a little portion of independence. Qualitatively, part and parcel means... Just like you take a drop of water from the sea. The, all the chemical composition is there in the drop. So Kṛṣṇa is fully independent. So we living entities we are drop. Still, the independence quality is there in minute quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> But Kṛṣṇa has no tendency to fall, whereas we do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because Kṛṣṇa is God. Therefore He is all good. Even He falls down, to our estimation, it is not fall down. [break] ...cannot judge God. If we are devotee, in all circumstances we shall glorify God, "You are all-good." That is devotee. You cannot criticize God, "Oh, You are doing such thing," no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> I'm still puzzled about the relationship of the soul to God. If the soul is eternal, as God is, and yet some souls have the tendency to fall and others don't have that tendency...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, eternal does not mean not fall. Suppose you are now professor. So you can fall down from your position. But that does not mean you are not eternal. If you are fall down from your position, you do not lose your eternity. You simply fall down. You can become a professor; you can become an ordinary man. But you are eternal in all circumstance. Eternal... Fall down does not mean that he loses his eternal. That is stated that <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out. <span class="Italic">Ajo nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">. Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit.</span> The living entity is never born or it never dies. This is eternity. You change your body, but you eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> It's so puzzling, though, why I would spend eternity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore he requires that <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span> qualification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> The what qualification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> I'm sorry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> Goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The mode of goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mode of goodness. Just like not that everyone can become a philosophy professor. It requires certain qualification. But everyone can become also. Everyone got the chance. Provided he is qualified, then he can take the post of a philosophy professor. Everyone has got the chance, not that you have got only the chance. Anyone has got the chance. But not that without having a certain qualification, one can become. Similarly, these thing will remain puzzling unless one comes to the qualification of goodness. Therefore we order our disciples, "Come to the platform of goodness. Give up all this nonsense habit." Then it will be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him ask. (pause) <span class="Italic">Tato rajas-tamo-bhāvāḥ [SB </span>1.2.19]<span class="Italic">.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sattva-guṇa,</span> goodness. In that platform one can understand very quickly. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is little successful because we are trying to bring the students on the platform of goodness. Therefore it is becoming little successful.

A devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is as good as the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> because the devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> leads his life in terms of the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is full of information about the Personality of Godhead and His pure devotees, who are also <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatas.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> book and person are identical.</div>
</div><div class="Normal-Level">The devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is a direct representative of Bhagavān, the Personality of Godhead. So by pleasing the devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> one can receive the benefit of the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Human reason fails to understand how by serving the devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> or the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> one gets gradual promotion on the path of devotion. But actually these are facts explained by Śrīla Nāradadeva, who happened to be a maidservant's son in his previous life. The maidservant was engaged in the menial service of the sages, and thus he also came into contact with them. And simply by associating with them and accepting the remnants of foodstuff left by the sages, the son of the maidservant got the chance to become the great devotee and personality Śrīla Nāradadeva. These are the miraculous effects of the association of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatas.</span> And to understand these effects practically, it should be noted that by such sincere association of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatas</span> one is sure to receive transcendental knowledge very easily, with the result that he becomes fixed in the devotional service of the Lord. The more progress is made in devotional service under the guidance of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatas,</span> the more one becomes fixed in the transcendental loving service of the Lord. The messages of the book <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> therefore, have to be received from the devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> and the combination of these two <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatas</span> will help the neophyte devotee to make progress on and on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are giving this chance to everyone, devotee <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and <span class="Italic">grantha-Bhāgavata,</span> to get them raised from the lower condition of life. <span class="Italic">Kāma-lobha,</span> lusty desires or greediness. This is the process. And practically you can see all these young men. They have no more lusty desires or greediness. They are also young men. They never ask permission from me any time, "Now, today, I want to go to the cinema." They have got all the monies in their hand. They never misspend without my permission. They are also young men, born in the western countries, addicted to so many bad habits. But they have given up. This is practical. Professor Judah has written me letter. You know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> No, I do not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "I am simply amazed how you have converted drug-addicted hippies to become servant of Kṛṣṇa and the humanity." That is his puzzling. But the method is so nice that it automatically becomes. Therefore we are stressing on the method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> In other words, Śrīla Prabhupāda, without practice of the method, it's very difficult to understand the philosophical concepts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. Therefore it is said that without becoming a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> nobody should touch <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> That is a... Without becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa...</span></div>
<div class="Verse">janmana jāyate śūdraḥ<br class="calibre2"/>saṅskarād bhaved dvijaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>veda-pathad bhaved vipro<br class="calibre2"/>brahmā jānātīti brāhmaṇaḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These are the different stages. Everyone is born <span class="Italic">śūdra. Śūdra</span> means the life of lamentation. He does something and laments. This is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He does not know how to perform, but by whims he does something and laments later on. This is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> And <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> means <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> He never laments, neither hankers. That is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhutaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> 18.54. I should read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"One who is thus transcendentally situated at once realizes the Supreme Brahman. He never laments nor desires to have anything; he is equally disposed to every living entity. In that state he attains pure devotional service unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means one has to come to the platform of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Then he can enter into devotional service. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> In that brāhminical state he sees every living entity as part and parcel of God. That is <span class="Italic">samaḥ,</span> equality. He does not see like this, that the human being has soul and the cow has not soul. He does not see like that. He sees the cow has soul, the ant has soul, the elephant has soul, the tree has soul, the human being has soul. That is <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> By ignorance he thinks that "The tree has no soul; the cow has no soul; the animal has no soul; simply we have got soul." That is ignorance, base quality. But when you come to the pureness of goodness, <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu,</span> this qualification will arise. So a devotee is not willing to kill even an ant because he knows that "He is also soul, part and parcel. By his <span class="Italic">karma,</span> he has become ant, I have become a human being. So I am the same soul; he is the same soul. He is different body. He is suffering in that way. I have got different body. I am also suffering, but I am thinking I am enjoying." That is <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> What is the meaning, <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> <span class="Italic">Samaḥ</span> means equally disposed; <span class="Italic">sarveṣu</span> means all; <span class="Italic">bhūteṣu</span> means living entity. "He is equally disposed to every living entity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can see on equal level when (sic:) you become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> not in the United Nation, passing resolution and fight is going on outside, because they have no vision, <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> So the politicians should be guided by the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> That is social structure. Those who are first-class men in the spiritual understanding... Or the politicians, the administrators, they should take instruction from the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and take part in politics. Then they will be also first-class men. You haven't got to drag him down again. First of all elect, and drag him down. This is mistake. Just like you elected Nixon president; again you dragged him down, because there was mistake. You do not know who to elect because you are not guided by <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> This is the fault. The whole society is being guided by the <span class="Italic">mle..., śūdras</span> and some portion <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> Mostly <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and some certain percentage, mercantile. And no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Therefore, for the peaceful life in human society, there must be four divisions. Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> 4.13.</div>
<div class="Verse">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tasya kartāram api māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viddhy akartāram avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me. And, although I am the creator of this system, you should know that I am yet the non-doer, being unchangeable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa created these four division, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra,</span> but He does not belong to any one of them. He is neither <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> nor <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> nor <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He is transcendental. Similarly, our philosophy-just to make the human society very peaceful and making progress we wish to establish this system. A first-class man, group of men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they will guide the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> the administrators, they will guide the <span class="Italic">vaiśya. Vaiśya</span> means agriculture and cow protection and trade. And <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> means those who are neither <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> nor <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> They are simply worker, assistant. So there must be division like this. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> should guide the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> and the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> will administer the state, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> will produce foodstuff, and <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> will help. Cooperation for common benefit. But the aim is spiritual realization. That is perfect society. If everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> without any aim of life, then there will be chaos. Just like in your country, in spite of so much facility for education, the students are produced hippies, useless for all purposes. Why? I have gone to so many universities. I have seen the students, hippies. And if you say that "If you act like cats and dogs, you will become dog next life," they say, "What is the wrong if I become a dog?" (laughter) This is education. He is prepared to become a dog. He does not know what is the distinction between dog and human being. He is seeking after the dog's facility that he can have sex on the street. He is thinking the dog life is advantageous. This is the position. Therefore Professor Judah has written me this letter, that "I am simply surprised how you have converted the drug-addicted hippies into servant of Kṛṣṇa and the humanity." This is his words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> May I ask you another question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> The relationship of mind to the soul, how the mind comes to know that it has or that there is a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By taking lesson from professors who has mind clear. Why the students are coming to you? Because his mind is not clear. You have to clear his mind by teaching him psychology, feeling, thinking, feeling, willing. Therefore he has to come to a learned man who knows how to understand mind, how to understand the activities of the mind, how to deal with them. That requires education. A dog cannot take this education, but a human being can take. Therefore it is the duty of the human being, how to control the mind, not act like cats and dogs. That is human being. He should be inquisitive, "Why this happening? Why this happening?" and he should take education. That is human life. And if he does not inquire, if he does not take education, then what is the difference between him and the dog? He remains a dog. He has got this opportunity of human life. He should take advantage of understanding what is what, not to keep himself in the dog status, simply eating, sleeping, sex life, and defending. That is the distinction between dog and human being. If he does not become inquisitive how to control the mind, he is not even a human being. A dog never inquires. A dog knows that "When I bark, people become disturbed." He'll never ask, "How to control this barking habit?" Because he is dog, he cannot do that. A human being can know that "People hates me. I do something wrong. How to control my mind?" That is human being. That is the difference between human being and dog. Therefore Vedic injunction is "Go and inquire. You have got this human form of life." <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>:</span> "Now, this is the time for inquiring about the soul." <span class="Italic">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to understand this science, then go to proper guru and take lessons from him. The same thing, as we instruct our children: "If you want to be educated in higher status of life, go to school, go to college, take lesson." That is human society. The dog's father will never ask the dog child, "Go to school." No. They are dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The universities nowadays don't teach any courses in the nature of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he says, "What is the wrong if I become a dog?" Because there is no education. He does not know the difference between dog and the human being. Therefore he says that "What is the wrong if I become a dog? I will get more facility for sex without any criminal charges." This is the advancement of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. John Mize:</span> How does the mind, then, come to know that there is a soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I say, that you have to educated. How these people are convinced about the soul? They have been educated by practice and by knowledge. Everything has to be learned by being educated. And therefore the Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārtham,</span> "In order to know that science," <span class="Italic">gurum eva abhigacchet,</span> "you must go to guru, teacher." So the answer is that you must go to the teacher who can teach you how the soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Prabhupāda, the professor asked what is the relationship with the soul and the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind is there in the soul, but the mind is now polluted by material contamination. Just like a madman. He has got his mind, but his mind is contaminated. Therefore he requires treatment by psychiatrist. You cannot say the madman has no mind. He has got mind, but it is contaminated. You have to make treatment. So mind is there. Everything is there in the soul. And now the mind, contaminated by the matter, it is perverted. The same example: A madman has got mind, but it is useless. He is simply acting in madness. The same madman, when properly treated, he will act like a sane man. So mind is there always, in the pure soul or in the material body. Everything is spiritual. The soul is spiritual; the mind is spiritual; the intelligence is spiritual. But it is now contaminated. So you have to make treatment. When it is purified, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then mind is controlled, intelligence properly acting, and soul is in his proper position. Therefore those who are under treatment, they must be strict observation-he may not do something wrong so that treatment may be hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Philosophers generally try to use their mind to speculate about the nature of the soul. But with the mind they can never understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the madman is speculating. He is thinking, "I am president. <span class="Italic">Bas,</span> finished." He is lying down on the street, "Oh, I am completely independent. Why shall I go on the foot path?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> When the soul was in the spiritual sky, it also had a mind and an intelligence like here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Yes. Unless he has got mind, how he misuses intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> But he misused that intelligence in his freedom, his independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Mind is there also. That is spiritual mind. Everything is spiritual. There is nothing material. Body spiritual, mind spiritual, intelligence spiritual, he is spiritual, the land spiritual, water spiritual-everything is spiritual. That is spiritual world. Here in the material world, except the spirit soul, everything is material. And he is encumbered with this material atmosphere by twenty-seven stratas, layers. The five elements, gross elements, then ten senses, and then three <span class="Italic">guṇas...</span> In this way there are twenty-seven layers. He is within, and he has to be taken out. That is called liberation. Just like if you are covered with twenty-seven layers of dirty things, so it is very difficult position. But there is process to clear the garbage and take him out. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious movement, to take the soul out of the covering of twenty-seven layers of material atmosphere. That <span class="Italic">śloka</span> is <span class="Italic">naṣṭa-prāyeṣu abhadreṣu:</span> "almost cleansed." <span class="Italic">Abhadra, abhadra</span> means dirty things. So this clearing process going on. When it is almost cleansed the man feels, "Oh..." And that process: <span class="Italic">nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā [SB </span>1.2.18]<span class="Italic">,</span> constantly being engaged in the service of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, grantha-Bhāgavata</span> and the person <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Then it will be cleansed. And then, when he comes out, that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Oh, I am now free." <span class="Italic">Na śocati na...,</span> no more lamentation, no more greediness. Everything finished. Then he begins his real business as part and parcel of God. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Prabhupāda, in the Thirteenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> "Nature, Enjoyer, and Consciousness," in verse number six and seven you mention those twenty-seven coverings: "The five great elements, false ego, intelligence, the unmanifest, the ten senses, the mind, the five sense objects, desire, hate, happiness, and distress, the aggregate, the life symptoms and convictions-all these are considered, in summary, to be the field of activities and their interaction." And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By the material life, these are our field of activities. The body is a combination of all these things. Just like a huge computer machine. It is made of these material things, but the mechanical parts are very minute, different. All these are matter. But within this matter, because the soul is there, therefore the finest machine is working. Just like your composition machine, (imitates machine:) "Kut, kut, kut, kut, kut, kut." But one has to push the button; otherwise useless. However very nicely made the machine, without a living being's touch, it is useless. So all this big machine, body, is wonderful so long the soul is there. And as soon as the soul is out it is lump of matter, useless, not worth a penny. Throw it away. So we are giving importance to the machine, not to the person who is dealing with the machine. This is the folly of modern civilization. We are thinking like child, "The machine is working independently." But that is not the fact. The big airship, 747, is flying because the pilot is there, and the pilot is a soul, covered by another bodily machine. And that, that is missing point in the modern civilization, that who is working with the machine. That they do not know. That is ignorance. It is said-you see <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3">hṛd-deśe</i> 'rjuna tiṣṭhati<br class="calibre2"/>bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>yantrārūḍhāni māyayā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Yantra</span> means machine. So the modern education is missing the pilot. They are simply wandering with the machine. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3">hṛd-deśe</i> 'rjuna tiṣṭhati<br class="calibre2"/>bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>yantrārūḍhāni māyayā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"The Supreme Lord is situated in everyone's heart, O Arjuna, and is directing the wanderings of all living entities, who are seated as on a machine, made of the material energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. They do not consider this body as machine. In spite of all education, they are thinking that there is no other element than this machine. And actually, they are finding that big, nice machine, computer, without an operator, it does not work. And this huge machine is working without any spiritual touch? Just see how foolishness. They think automatically working. Nature is working automatically. Do they not think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> They think there's a mind, but not a soul.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. Something is there which is working. Now that may be mistake. You call it soul or mind. That is next understanding. But the machine is not working independently. That should be understood first. Then how the machine is working that will be next chapter. So they have no understanding even that how the machine is working. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> That they do not know, <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> So if you do not know how the machine is working then what is the value of your education? Education means enlightenment. You do not know what is the final cause, that huge body is working as nature, so many planets, so many big, big planets like sun, moon, they are floating in the air. Who has made this arrangement? They are... We see every day. They will never accept God is the original cause. That thing does not come to their brain. They are putting forward different theories and that is being accepted. One theory is accepted today, and tomorrow, "No, no, this is not. Here is another, advanced theory." That advanced means he does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, accepting that there is a eternal soul, how is the soul distinguished, then, from the body or from the machine since things like the senses, the mind, the intelligence, desire and hate, which people accept as the symptoms of the soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proof, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the body is finished, no more working, the soul is there, he has accepted another body. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati.</span> Those who are educated, sober they are not surprised. Those who are not educated, they are surprised. Therefore this very word is used, <span class="Italic">dhīras tatra na muhyati. Dhīra</span> means one who is sober by education. He knows the soul has now left this body. He has accepted another body. That is <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> He knows by education. Therefore this very word... Find out.</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanam jara<br class="calibre2"/>tatha dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That's Chapter number two, text thirteen. "As the embodied soul continually passes in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. He does not lament. "No, this body is no more useful." Just like this dress is no more useful. Throw it away. Accept another dress. But dress is old, now it is useless, that does not (mean) you are useless. You accept another dress. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, but my question was what distinguishes the soul from the body? Because here we're mentioning everything that is the field of activity, but then what is the soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is acting on the field. If the field is not acting, the soul is not there. Just like field, agricultural field, when you see the food grains are growing, the grass is there nicely, the paddy is growing nicely, you know, "Somebody is working." And in the jungle, where there is no paddy field, it is simply jungle, you know nobody is working. Where is the difficulty? When these things are in working order, then you know the soul is there. And it is decomposing, lying on the field and birds are coming, eating, dogs are biting-that means the soul is not there. This is distinction. Where is the difficulty? When the motor car is standing on the middle road, you know, "There is no driver. It is left over." Although the big machine, but because there is no driver, it is lying uncared for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So the soul is the conscious worker of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. A little mistake will cause disaster. Therefore education means to protect him from committing mistake. This is education. And if you keep him in the darkness, what is the value of education? (aside:) Get that switch on. Education means enlightenment. One should know "What I am? I am this body or something else other than the body?" This is education. That is self-realization. "Oh, I am not this body; I am soul. And I am simply working for the body? What I am doing for me? I say, 'It is my body,' so I am working for my, and what for the 'I?' " Where is that education? If you simply take care of "my" and don't take care of "I," is that education? That taking care of "my" is done by the dog, and taking care of "I" is done by the human being. That is the difference. The dog, as soon as he sees another foreign dog in that neighborhood, he begins barking, "Gow! Gow! Gow!" So we are doing the same business in the immigration department: "Why you have come? Have you got visa?" This is civilization, but the dog's business. "Gow! Gow!" In Paris I went without visa, and they detained me for four hours. Well, a human being has come here. Why the immigration law so strict? But that is advancement of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have to keep out the thieves and the rogues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they have created thieves and rogues. Therefore they are suspicious. Nowadays in the airport, everyone is searched. Then it is now taken for granted that all of them are cheats. So what is the value of this education if all of them are cheats? There is no discrimination, "Now, here is a educated professor, Dr. Ph.D., he cannot be searched." No, he will be also searched-because, "You may be Ph.D., but we know you are a cheat." (laughter) Is not the conclusion? Will he be excused if he says, "Oh, I am Ph.D." No, you must be searched. "You may be Ph.D., but you are a cheat." This is education. So what is the value of this education? And according to Vedic civilization, as soon as one is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he is not within the jurisdiction of administration, immediately. The government has no right to check in his activities. Because he knows he is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Four person, four or five, they are excused from the jurisdiction of law. The first is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> the second is cow, the third is woman, and the fourth is old man, and fifth is the child. These five persons are not in the jurisdiction of law. No. Just like we have got practical. If a child comes and takes my spectacle away, he is not criminal. Everyone knows. But if a man takes my spectacle, then he is criminal. Similarly, a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is never criminal. A cow is never criminal. These are the Vedic civilization. Woman, woman is also excused. No punishment for woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Now the crime rate amongst the women is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they have been trained up. What can be done? Woman is not trained up now to become a chaste wife. That is the defect of the civilization. Formerly, woman was trained up only to become, remain faithful to his husband, that's all. <span class="Italic">Nari-rūpaṁ pati-vrataḥ:</span> "Woman's beauty is how she is faithful to her husband." That's all. That is beauty, not personal beauty. <span class="Italic">Vidyā rūpaṁ kurupanam:</span> "A black man or ugly man, if he is educated, that is his beauty." <span class="Italic">Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpaṁ. Kokila,</span> the cuckoo is just like a crow, but everyone likes because his voice is so sweet. <span class="Italic">Kokilānāṁ svaro rūpaṁ vidyā rūpaṁ kurupanam nari-rūpaṁ pati-vratam.</span> Like that, he has given a list. These are the beauty. If a woman is trained up not to talk with any other man except her husband, that is her beauty. That enhances the beauty and prestige. This is Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In today's society that standard is unimaginable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore there is no adjustment. Everyone is suffering in spite of so-called education. Nobody is happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the professor was also saying that Kant had a theistic viewpoint also. He believed that there was God and what other things were you saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> The nature of God? Kant's view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Kant's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> That the purpose of the human existence is to improve it's moral nature, to reunite ultimately with God, to be pleasing to God. So it's similar in that sense. He apparently disagrees on the origin...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> Good character means <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa,</span> to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and then love God. This is Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Does he make any description of God? Any explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> His thesis is that God is an intelligent moral force. But he avoided anthropomorphism by not projecting such properties as anger onto God. But he recognized personality in God. God is a moral intelligence and powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So to become angry, that is also qualification of God, to become angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To become angry is also qualification of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> I don't understand what you last said. To be angry is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> A quality of God. To become angry is a quality of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because unless there is anger in God, how there is anger in me? But we, as we misuse our independence, we misuse our anger. And God does not misuse his independence; He does not misuse His anger. But the anger quality is there. Otherwise, how I have got anger? This is the Vedānta philosophy. <span class="Italic">Janmādyasya yataḥ:</span> "Everything is emanating from the Supreme." So if the anger is there, it must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> And jealousy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> It's difficult to imagine Kṛṣṇa jealous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> What could He possibly envy or be jealous of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can say whatever thing, but anger, all, whatever you have got, God has got in bigger quantity and perfect quantity. That is the conception of God, without any, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Imperfection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imperfection, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> I hope He doesn't have my ignorance in such a mass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> But ignorance is not a positive existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> And His anger or jealousy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, sometimes anger acts. If you fight, if you do not be angry, you cannot fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> there are so many stories of Kṛṣṇa's anger or... Once, when His mother was (indistinct) a cooking pot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Kṛṣṇa's activities are always for the good. So even when He becomes angry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Righteous anger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes, spiritual anger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> It's His mercy. So if Kṛṣṇa gets angry at us, that's actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything has got proper use. In the material condition we do not know that. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has made a list, how to use your, this anger, greediness, like that. He says, <span class="Italic">kamaḥ kṛṣṇa-karmārpaṇe.</span> We are lusty for doing something for our sense gratification. The same desire, same propensity, can be utilized for serving Kṛṣṇa. Just like we are writing books, keeping night, whole night. So for an old man like me, it is tedious. But we are doing for Kṛṣṇa. So similarly, another author may be writing whole night for some sex literature. So the labor for producing a sex literature and the labor for producing a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is the same. It may be same ambition that "Let me become a big author. My name will be very popular." But one thing is being done for Kṛṣṇa; one thing is being done for sense gratification. So that propensity of becoming a reputed author or the labor, this, same, but it is being utilized for different purposes. Similarly, you take anything, if you use it for... Just like Hanumān. He became angry upon Rāvaṇa. He set fire in his city, destroyed the whole city. He showed his anger, but not for his personal sense gratification. He wanted to serve Lord Rāma. Sītā was stolen by him, so there was arrangement for fighting, and he did the same thing, set fire. To set fire in your home or your country, it is not good, but he did it for satisfaction of Lord Rāmacandra. So everything has its proper use when it is utilized for serving Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are living beings. We are conscious. We cannot give up anything, but we are being trained up how to utilize everything for Kṛṣṇa. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda has written one book-actually it will be two books, this thick-on all the different philosophers. Prabhupāda is discussing their philosophy in relationship with Kṛṣṇa consciousness and where their weak points are. This book will be published soon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The publisher is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> As soon as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That will be very interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> I look forward to seeing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, did you speak about Kant's philosophy in that book also? Yes? He is very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kant is very popular. I was also a student of philosophy. In my student life my professors were all Europeans. I was student of Scottish Church's College in Calcutta. So one professor, Dr. W.S. Urquhart, he was our professor for psychology, metaphysics. Later on, he became the vice-chancellor of Calcutta University. A very nice gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Dr. Mize finds that he's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa a little in the shower now. When he takes a shower, he chants a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One press reporter in the Berkeley University in the beginning, he wrote his article and he wrote that after hearing this Hare Kṛṣṇa for a few minutes, I came home chanting all the road, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." He gave this report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> I think many scholars have a hard time realizing how just by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is so nice and so easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> ...that the highest philosophical realization can come from chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Mrs. Salim has given these flowers and clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That gentleman who came over last night, he has brought this present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take. (eating)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Mize:</span> This is delicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you can take. Kṛṣṇa has given us so many nice things. Why should we kill the poor animals? That's not good. Because <span class="Italic">na samaḥ,</span> there is no such vision, <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> He is not a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He is giving the dog a bad name and hang it. Animal has no soul. What is this? Animal has no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Sometimes they argue that we're killing the vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Vegetable has also life but we are not killing. When you pluck out the flower, the tree is not killed. When you take a fruit, the tree is not killed. When you take grains, automatically they die. Then you take the grains. There is no question of killing. But even it is killing, it is not as murderous as killing a cow. Why the state hangs a man when he kills a man? The man can plead that "So many animals are being killed every day. If I kill one man, what is the wrong there?" The punishment is that "You have killed one important animal." Therefore the <span class="Italic">Bhaga..., kṛṣi-go-rakṣya,</span> that cow should be protected because it is a very, very, important animal. It does not say, "Other animal." Or does not say, "All animals." He said, "Cows," because important. It's supplying you milk, so important food. She is your mother and you are killing mother? Is that your civilization? Killing mother? "Mother is old, and mother is no more supplying milk. Kill." Is there any such sanction? Rather, old mother is given more protection. And what is this civilization, killing the mother? In the morning we require milk immediately, and the mother cow is supplying. And when she cannot supply, kill her. What is this philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> I was lecturing in the University of Marin in San Francisco. So I was explaining that, and one man said, "This is just your sentiment. You just have some sentiment." So I asked him if he had a dog. And he said, "Yes." So I said that "When your dog becomes old, will you kill it?" So he said, "No, why shall I kill it. It's a good dog." So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dog is good; cow is bad. Dog is creating always nasty things, and cow is so pure, even the stool is pure, and she has to be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> The question has been asked about the unfertilized eggs, why they should not be eaten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unfertilized, but there is potency of fertilization. You check the progress of one living entity coming out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Once the egg is laid, there is no chance for it to be fertilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, egg is... The living entity is already there. Just like a woman is pregnant means the living entity is already there. So as soon as there is egg, the living entity is already there. It is taking time to come out. Just in the womb of the mother, the child is taking time to grow and become fit to come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> True, but the egg in the mother has been fertilized by the male sperm, whereas the egg laid by a chicken was not fertilized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. They have got that potency. There are four kinds of birth: from the egg, from the vegetable, from fermentation, and from embryo. So from any of these four kinds of sources the living entity come out. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍa-ja, udbij-ja, jaraya-ja,</span> and <span class="Italic">sveda-ja,</span> the Sanskrit name. <span class="Italic">Sveda-ja,</span> simply by perspiration. Just like unclean bed they produce bugs. The man gets perspiration, bad perspiration, and in contact with air, with this perspiration, the living entity comes. That is bug. This is called <span class="Italic">sveda-ja,</span> "out of perspiration." Your coat, shirt, if you don't cleanse, or your body is unclean, you will find so many moths within the shirt. How it is coming? From the perspiration, bad perspiration, bad smell. Not that every time the male female combination required. There are other sources also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that is called spontaneous generation and scientists have so-called proven that that cannot occur. It's called a folk myth or something like this, folklore, that birth can take place without the male and female union.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How it is coming from the bed, unclean bed. How it is coming the grass? They are also living entity. The seeds are already there. They are like egg. And as soon as there is watering then it is fructified and it comes. Similarly, the egg..., fermentation, what is called, fermentation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Fertilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fertilization. Not fertilize. The birds sit on the egg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Incubation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incubation, yes. They are artificially incubating, and the chickens are coming from the egg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> If it's been fertilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, not fertilized. They are keeping in certain temperature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> It has to have both, fertilization and incubation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> Both. The egg cannot become a chicken unless it has been fertilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, that... It is coming out of that egg, so there is life. We do not recommend prohibition of eggs because living entity. It is not very good food. It agitates the senses. Therefore we prohibit. Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the doctor's first question that he brought up that although we are conscious, our consciousness seems to be affected by different material arrangements. There's one philosopher William James, who is like the father of psychology. He says the same thing that consciousness can be affected by removing the material elements. So that is simply the arrangement of the modes of nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> If you contact with <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> then your consciousness is <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa. Tamo-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, sattva-guṇa,</span> and if your consciousness is always with Kṛṣṇa, then Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> James had a very interesting view of consciousness. The brain doesn't cause the consciousness, he felt. It does not originate it. It only receives it like a radio receiver is receiving transmissions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> He felt that the source of consciousness was divine. James was a religious man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Sometimes also he would have a material view also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> That matter can give rise to consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes. He would take both sides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> His final stand on it was theistic, that the brain simply gives transmission of the consciousness through it. It does not produce it, whereas in the Soviet philosophy, that is, that matter gives rise to consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Where do they have any example that matter has given rise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> This. They point to us. They deny a soul. There is simply matter, the brain, that generates consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, Rāmeśvara would like to show you some paintings. They are bringing the book to the printer this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. I am coming. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "...and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unmotivated means "Oh, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, service of Kṛṣṇa, is so nice. Let me begin immediately." Now, "What will be the result? What shall I gain? What is the profit?" No such consideration. "Begin immediately." And if you begin in that way, there is no impediment. <span class="Italic">Apratihatā.</span> It is so nice thing. In the material world, if you want to begin some work, then you require some preliminary qualification. It doesn't require any preliminary qualification. Whatever qualification you have got, that is sufficient. Begin. And nobody can say, "Oh, I am not educated," "I am not rich," or "I am not born of a high family." There are so many. No. These things are not impediments. Educated or uneducated, culture or no culture, it doesn't matter. You can begin immediately. The Indian culture was checked by the caste <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> that "This Kṛṣṇa consciousness is meant for the Hindus." Therefore it was not spread. Such a great thing, philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> remained covered because they thought it is meant for the Hindus, for the Indians, or those who came out of India, they misinterpreted in a rubbish way. And now it is being presented as it is, it is becoming effective. Therefore <span class="Italic">apratihatā:</span> nothing material can check its progress. Unless one voluntarily refuses it, there is no checking. Some other professor was to come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, but he did not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> I spoke this morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda, with Dr. Judah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He'll be arriving tomorrow night. He just got in from Boston and he wanted one day to rest a little bit, and then he'll be coming tomorrow night. He'll probably get here around seven o'clock and then he'll come on the walk in the morning and then you can, as you like, you can speak with him that day. He has spoke already with the publisher, the Wiley Company and he is getting permission that you wanted him to publish some part of his book, that preface. So he is getting permission from them to do that. He also... I was speaking with him. He also said that if you wanted, he would write more different things supporting our movement. Some little thing to print, like some little book, like we had "The Scientific Basis," he could write some little things independently and we could print whatever you like. He is very eager to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You mean like a foreword?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He could print some foreword and it would be inserted in our book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He said he'll write whatever Prabhupāda wants. He is surrendered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Learned scholars, philosophers, they should understand the importance of this movement and how it is beneficial. They are suffering for want of knowledge of the spirit soul.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">John Mize:</span> I did not understand the answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Prabhupāda said that those who are on the mental platform will argue that the animal has no soul. They will be hankering and lamenting...</div>
