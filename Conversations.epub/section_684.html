<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are trying to eradicate this conception of life, bodily conception of life. The animals... An animal, he is also thinking, "I am dog," "I am cat," "I am cow," "I am ass," on account of this bodily concept of life. And if we human beings, we also remain in that bodily concept of life, then we are no better than the animals. So if we remain animals, there cannot be any peace. You bring a dozens of dogs, and if you keep them, they cannot be improved. They will remain as animal. They have no capacity. And if you ask them to live peacefully, it is not possible, because they are animals. Similarly, if we human beings, although we are not animals, but we are not being educated as human being, and therefore we remain as animal, so how there can be any peace? The animal eats; we eat. The animal sleeps; we sleep. The animals have sex life; we have got sex life. The animal defends; we also defend. So if we remain engaged only on the principles of four demands of body, then we remain animal. Our extra education requires that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul." And there is necessity of the soul. If we don't come to this platform, then we remain animals. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are trying to bring human being to the platform of spiritual consciousness or real human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Are you striving for peace in the world? Is it one of your goals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone is trying for peace in the world. I have already referred to the United Nations organization. They are also trying peace of the world. But one must know the right way how to bring peace in the world. So our proposition is that if you keep the human being as good as animal, then how there can be peace? There cannot be any peace among animal society. (aside:) <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> Let him... <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> This is our proposal. So we are bringing these Europeans, Americans, Africans, Canadians, Australians to this platform of understanding, that "We are human being; we are not animals." The... First I have already explained. So long we shall remain in the bodily concept of life, then we remain animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> What was the necessity of creating this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Necessity is that the human form of life is meant for advanced education. Unfortunately, they are being educated to live like animals. That is the mistake. So we want to correct this mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But the spiritual organizations in India, all the spiritual teachings in India, have always put great emphasis on the fact that we are spiritual beings. So what was the necessity of creating another movement to say the same things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are... You have brought in the question of India. We are talking of the human society, so why you are bringing India? We are not talking about India only. Human being does not mean only Indian. You see, human being-all, outside India, inside India, everywhere. Wherever there is human being, they require this education. And it is the India's duty. Because India has got the opportunity to be spiritually advanced by the grace of learned, saintly persons, so they should first of all make their life perfect by taking education and distribute the knowledge throughout the whole world. That is India's mission. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, that... The exact word is</div>

<div class="Purp-para">Anyone who has taken birth in India as human being, he should first of all make his life perfect and... [break] ...no customer is coming, we go to sell our books. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Have you had a significant impact on the American society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Have you had a significant impact on the American society? The values you preach, have they influenced Americans to a certain degree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes. You can go in America, any country, any city, and everyone will know Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's not what I mean. What I mean is have Americans started to be less violent, for instance, or have they started to be less egotistical or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, not unless they follow our movement. But those who have followed our movement... Recently there was one study that was published by a very eminent sociologist in America from the University of California, the (sic:) Union Theological Center, and he stated in that book that the members of this movement, formerly they were drug-addicted hippies, and now they have become servants of Kṛṣṇa and humanity, loving servants. So he has given proof through intensive interviews that one who follows and joins this movement, dramatically his life becomes changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect. He is a big professor, and his books are being sold in higher circles. Professor Judah. And he has studied this movement for five years. And... You have got that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Show him. So they are appreciating. Appreciation has begun. Formerly they thought it is another edition of hippie movement, but now they are realizing it is not. A cultural. He has given the name of the book, <span class="Italic">Hare Kṛṣṇa and Counterculture.</span> He is selling at the cost of twelve dollars; still, all high class, educated class, are purchasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Have you any program for the common people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Common people have joined. Everyone. We are opening centers so that any common man from any caste, any creed, any nation, they can come and join.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> My friend, perhaps you would like to do... I know you are doing some social work for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the best social work. We are making animal into man. Already I have begun this, that because they are not educated how to become human being, so they remain animals. So this is the best social work, that we are bringing animals, two-legged animals, to real human being. If a human being is not properly educated, he remains an animal. So this is the proper education. Therefore we are bringing animals to human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Has your movement arranged once any particular event which is a movement in a particular country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. When we are many in number, then we shall take politics also. Yes. First of all let there be perfect men. If there is no perfect men, the government will be imperfect. If there is perfect men, the government will be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> Do you think, Swamiji, that man can become perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the chance of a human being. Therefore in the human society there is school, college, education, culture, not in the animal society, because they can be made into perfect, not the animals. So if they are denied proper education, that is the greatest harm. They got the opportunity, and the authorities are not giving them their opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, but do you mean the perfectness is to become God or to become the man? Then I want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You never become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> What does perfectness mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect means to become god<span class="Italic">ly</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Can you be interested directly in politics?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa was in politics. So He instructed Arjuna to fight. This is politic-for a good cause. When Arjuna denied that "Kṛṣṇa, I am not willing to kill my, the other side, my brothers and my uncles," He chastised him that <span class="Italic">kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame samupasthitam:</span> "How you are talking like non-Aryan? What is this nonsense?" He... <span class="Italic">Kutas tvā.</span> First of all... Find out.</div>
<div class="Verse">kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣame samupasthitam<br class="calibre2"/>anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam<br class="calibre2"/>akīrti-karam arjuna<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.2]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Anārya. Anārya. He has said <span class="Italic">anārya.</span> <span class="Italic">Ārya</span> means advanced. <span class="Italic">Anārya</span> means less advanced. Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chapter Two, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> text two:</div>
<div class="Verse">śrī-bhagavān uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣame samupasthitam<br class="calibre2"/>anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam<br class="calibre2"/>akīrti-karam arjuna<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.2]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"The Supreme Person, Bhagavān, said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Purport. "Kṛṣṇa and the Supreme Personality of Godhead are identical. Therefore Lord Kṛṣṇa is referred to as Bhagavān throughout the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Bhagavān is the ultimate in the Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding, namely Brahman, or the impersonal, all-pervasive spirit; Paramātmā, or the localized aspect of the Supreme within the heart of all living entities; and Bhagavān, or the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa. In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> this conception of the Absolute Truth is explained thus:</div>
<div class="Verse">vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br class="calibre2"/>tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br class="calibre2"/>brahmeti paramātmeti<br class="calibre2"/>bhagavān iti śabdyate<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.11]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">'The Absolute Truth is realized in three phases of understanding by the knower of the Absolute Truth, and all of them are identical. Such phases of the Absolute Truth are expressed as Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.' (<span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> First Canto, Second Chapter, eleventh verse.) These three divine aspects can be explained by the example of the sun, which also has three different aspects, namely the sunshine, the sun's surface and the sun planet itself. One who understands the sunshine only is the preliminary student. One who understands the sun's surface is further advanced. And one who can enter into the sun planet is the highest. Ordinary students who are satisfied by simply understanding the sunshine, its universal pervasiveness and the glaring effulgence of its impersonal nature may be compared to those who can realize only the Brahman feature of the Absolute Truth. The student who has advanced still further can know the sun disc, which is compared to knowledge of the Paramātmā feature of the Absolute Truth. And the student who can enter into the heart of the sun planet is compared to those who realize the personal features of the Supreme Absolute Truth. Therefore the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> or the transcendentalists who have realized the Bhagavān feature of the Absolute Truth, are the topmost transcendentalists, although all students who are engaged in the study of the Absolute Truth are engaged in the same subject matter. The sunshine, the sun disc and the inner affairs of the sun planet cannot be separated from one another, and yet the students of the three different phases are not in the same category. The Sanskrit word <span class="Italic">bhagavān</span> is explained by the great authority Parāśara Muni, the father of Vyāsadeva. The Supreme Personality who possesses all riches, all strength, all fame, all beauty, all knowledge and all renunciation is called Bhagavān. There are many persons who are very rich, very powerful, very beautiful, very famous, very learned, and very much detached, but no one can claim that he possesses all riches, all strength, etc., entirely. Only Kṛṣṇa can claim this because He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No living entity, including Brahmā, Lord Śiva or Nārāyaṇa, can possess opulences as fully as Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it is concluded in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> by Lord Brahmā himself that Lord Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. No one is equal to or above Him. He is the primeval Lord, or Bhagavān, known as Govinda, and He is the supreme cause of all causes.</div>
<div class="Verse">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>anādir ādir govindaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">'There are many personalities possessing the qualities of Bhagavān, but Kṛṣṇa is the supreme because none can excel Him. He is the Supreme Person, and His body is eternal, full of knowledge and bliss. He is the primeval Lord Govinda and the cause of all causes.' (<span class="Italic">Bs.</span> Fifth Chapter, first verse.) In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> also there is a list of many incarnations of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is described as the original Personality of Godhead, from whom many, many incarnations and Personalities of Godhead expand:</div>
<div class="Verse">ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam<br class="calibre2"/>indrāri-vyākulaṁ lokaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mṛḍayanti yuge yuge<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.3.28]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">'All the lists of the incarnations of Godhead submitted herewith are either plenary expansions or parts of the plenary expansions of the Supreme Godhead, but Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.' (<span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> First Canto, Third Chapter, twenty-eighth verse.) Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the AbssPURolute Truth, the source of both the Supersoul and the impersonal Brahman. In the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna's lamentation for his kinsmen is certainly unbecoming, and therefore Kṛṣṇa expressed His surprise with the word <span class="Italic">kutas,</span> 'wherefrom.' Such unmanly sentiments were never expected from a person belonging to the civilized class of men known as Aryans. The word <span class="Italic">ārya</span> is applicable to persons who know the value of life and have a civilization based on spiritual realization. Persons who are led by the material conception of life do not know that the aim of life is realization of the Absolute Truth, Viṣṇu or Bhagavān, and they are captivated by the external features of the material world, and therefore they do not know what liberation is. Persons who have no knowledge of liberation from material bondage are called non-Aryans. Although Arjuna was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> he was deviating from his prescribed duties by declining to fight. This act of cowardice is described as befitting the non-Aryans. Such deviation from duty does not help one in the progress of spiritual life, nor does it even give one the opportunity to become famous in this world. Lord Kṛṣṇa did not approve of the so-called compassion of Arjuna for his kinsmen."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this movement is to make the people Aryan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Telling... (microphone moving) Let's say, people who fight for their rights, the blacks in the United States or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>? <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya</span> means one who gives protection from being hurt, <span class="Italic">kṣat. Kṣat</span> means hurting. So suppose if I unnecessarily hurt you, then it is the duty of the government to give you protection. So unless I am also punished by violence, I cannot..., He cannot give you protection. So this is also necessary. Therefore in the society there must be <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> should be learned; they should give instruction, advice. The <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> should give protection; the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> should produce, economic development; and rest, they should assist-<span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> that's all. This is the program of Aryan society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5) (Indian man):</span> How long do you expect to stay in Mauritius?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Prabhupāda is leaving Sunday for Durban and Johannesburg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> And the others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They will stay here. We're making a center here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Have you any program of Swamiji for the common mass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Here in the evenings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually I want to speak only to the intelligent... [break] ...the common mass, they will not understand. But we can perform <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> for the common men, so that they may be purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Excuse me. I mean in your presence there must be some program like <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, this idea of society, of your culture, general mass of people, especially nowadays, it is very difficult. So if the leaders understand-<span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]-then the common mass will follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, but here in Mauritius, most of the people are of Indian origin. It is easy for them to understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say the Indian, the leading Indians here, if they make a program, the common will follow. And everything is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> how society should be conducted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But I think, Swamiji, common men follow only swamis, not the leaders or the priests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The idea is: the common men, they expect something, especially Indians, that India has got some spiritual culture. So every human being is seeking after spiritual culture, but unfortunately, at the present moment they are doing something which is not very desirable, the so-called swamis and yogis. I do not wish to describe them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Does your haircut have any particular significance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The shaving of the head is a sign of surrender to the spiritual master, and we leave the <span class="Italic">śikhā</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And keep the head light instead of unnecessarily burdened. In the Kali-yuga there is a symptom. It is stated in the... <span class="Italic">Lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam:</span> "In the Kali-yuga people will think by keeping long hairs he has become beautiful." This is the mentality of this age. <span class="Italic">Lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam.</span> You can write this. <span class="Italic">Lāvaṇyam</span> means luster, and <span class="Italic">keśa-dhāraṇam</span> means keeping hair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> By preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness would you condemn other people's beliefs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must condemn anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. We say... I don't condemn; Kṛṣṇa condemns.</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Duṣkṛtinaḥ means sinful; and <span class="Italic">mūḍhāḥ</span> means rascals, asses; and <span class="Italic">narādhamāḥ</span> means lowest of the mankind; and <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ</span> means their knowledge has been taken by <span class="Italic">māyā</span>; and <span class="Italic">āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ</span> means atheist class. So this class of men will never surrender to Kṛṣṇa. So if one is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, we immediately take them either of these: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span> This is our stand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, suppose someone follower of... (loud static)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not know who is the Supreme God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But Swamiji, Indian culture, although is (Hindi). Then why you are telling a king...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian culture is given (Hindi), that to allow them to worship the demigods means at least to accept the authority, and then they gradually come to the supreme authority. Just like for the common man, to give respect to the police constable means giving respect to the government. But the police constable is not the president of the government. So one should know who is the president. That is advancement. If you remain, simply offering respect to the constable, that is not advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Indian philosophy has always taught that light comes from many lamps. But you are preaching that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He says Indian culture has always taught that light comes from many lamps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But you are preaching... (loud static)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the supreme light. There are degrees of light. There is sunlight, and there is this light. You cannot compare this light with sun. (laughter) Light are so many, but that does not mean the sunlight and this light is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, what I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you understand this. You have questioned about the light. First of all you understand there are degrees of light. You cannot say this light and the sunlight is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> By this, you mean that those who adopt the teachings coming from the Koran or from the Bible is lesser light than from the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your business. That is your business. But we give you the idea that light comes from everywhere. There is one glowworm. That light also light, and the sunlight is also light. You cannot think that the glowworm's light and the sunlight is the same. Now it is your business to see which is glowworm light and which is sunlight. That is your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6) (Indian man):</span> It has been eloquently argued particularly in Third World countries that your movement is under the wing of a certain imperialist countries. Do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He said that there is some allegation that our movement is connected with certain imperialistic countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them say all nonsense. What can I do? Every nonsense will speak something nonsense. How can I check it? There are so many nonsenses, and therefore we are trying to make all these nonsense into human beings. That is our program. So long he is a nonsense, he will go on speaking nonsense. What can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Swamiji, one thing I want to know. This <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> from where you have got it, this <span class="Italic">śloka, lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam</span>? This <span class="Italic">śloka, lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dhāraṇam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is in the third chapter of Twelfth Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Have you got our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> Twelfth Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't have it with me.</div>
