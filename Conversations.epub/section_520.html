<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fools, they assemble together and people are unhappy. Democracy. Eh? Communists.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But they have some sort of democracy themselves.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are dictators. Stalin's dictatorship was going on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's all dictatorship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Democracy is also dictatorship. Just by elections. They elect a fool...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...and then he can do whatever he wants.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sacrifice means the animal slaughter has to be done in the mosque, is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It has to be made under special conditions. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...later on they turned into Vaiṣṇavas. [break] Young preachers, hopeless [break] ...real thing and people follow then everything is possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, then you can rule the world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]...combined together it is very pleasing. [break] Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tehran used to be very beautiful before there were so many cars. Very clean, very clear. The land, and when I was a child the land was very cheap here. So, now it is very, very expensive and very polluted with cars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Due to the cars?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Everyone was a farmer, now everyone is a factory worker.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. It was very nice, very clear and very nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again, let them become farmers. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The mornings were very cool, very cool and during the day it was hot. The mornings were always very clear and cool. (devotees chanting <i class="calibre3">japa</i> in background)</div>
<div class="Lecture">[break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, Tirupati, I that Deity is richer than many kings in the world. Daily, 100,000 rupees, not (indistinct), daily. [break] Which king who has got so much money? If you organize, you can take the whole income for cause of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you are really organized. That is possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Where is this temple?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In South India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> South India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) (barely audible) ...industrialists they are making life very difficult.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where, where?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India. Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One industrialist friend, (indistinct), who has come to Tehran, I visited him. Very, very rich industrialist, he built a temple, very nice temple, (indistinct), and the government was not pleased that he has built a temple and they came in and searched his house and they gave him 20,000,000 rupees penalty.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For constructing a temple?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, for taxes and but their real reason was they were not happy that he was spending his money constructing a temple. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Juhu Beach temple?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't mind. All the work is going on. It doesn't matter. [break] ...prayer, five times?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, it's the Islamic prayer five times a day but she is compressing it to three times. It's the same prayer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Because they are permitted to say two of the prayers at noon and two of the prayers in the evening at one time, rather than spreading them through the afternoon and ...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why are they disobeying the order of Mohammed?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, they follow. It's essentially the same practice as the majority.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you cannot amend on the words of Mohammed if you are a true Muslim.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't think they have meant to amend it, its just that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now why? There was five now they have made three. (indistinct) You cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They maintain that, that Ali, that this was the practice of Ali. That Ali prayed at noon in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ali is a representative of Mohammed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He's the brother, brother-in-law, the son-in-law.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ali.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ali, Ali.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He was...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ali Hussein.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hussein is his son. Ali is the cousin and the son-in-law of the prophet Mohammed. But can they feel the grace of Kṛṣṇa within this framework?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Within the framework of their dietary laws and their ah, in opening up the experience of Kṛṣṇa to them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If one wants to follow <i class="calibre3">Koran</i>, let him follow strictly that. No halfway (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Then preaching in Iran should be essentially to people who have fallen away from their traditional path.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone is fallen. They are simply amending, concoction. That is not good. Why they should amend? Mohammed presented himself in what relationship with God?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> With God? He presented himself as the last expression of the divine revelation in the West.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what was his relationship? Just like Christ, he presented himself as the son of God. So what is the position of Mohammed?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He presented himself as a man, was considered by Muslims to be the perfect man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And ah, he was the perfect expression of the divine manifestation in human terms. He was not a divine figure as Christ or Kṛṣṇa. He was a, ah, simply a man, and ah, he was the mouthpiece of the ah, divine word.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of Allah?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It means God, the greatest.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Greatest.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, God as being the superlative of (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Mohammed is the greatest? No, he's subordinate?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No. In fact, Muslims object to their religion being called Mohammedanism because it implies that they worship Mohammed. Whereas in fact they feel that they go straight to God, to Allah, which Mohammed is simply a messenger.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And they call their religion Islam, which means submission.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Muslim is he who submits.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then God is the greatest and we are infinite, finite, limited, we are not greatest.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And our business is to serve Him. What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Our business is to serve Him? Precisely it was said last night...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Our business is to satisfy. There is a tradition, there is a body of forty traditions, which are called the sacred traditions. One of which says, these are the words of God as enunciated through Mohammed, one of them saying that the more you strive towards Me...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...the more you love Me, the closer I come to you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the ultimate goal is how to love God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our philosophy. <i class="calibre3">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.2.6]. <i class="calibre3">Premā pumartho mahān</i>. This is the highest goal of life, how one has developed his love for God. And <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> says that is first-class religion which trains the followers how to love God and serve Him. That is first-class religion. Then Islam is Vaisnalam in crude form, like the Christians (indistinct) if they are sane man. I suggested that there are many churches vacant, if they give us these churches, we shall install Deity, Gaurasundara, Nitāi-Gaura and Pañca-tattva, and along with them we can worship Jesus Christ. Similarly, we can do Mohammed. But they are against this Deity worship. Yes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mohammedans?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, with that sort of expression.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And yet amongst the Sufi poets there is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) is also expression, form is also expression.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not understand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But the Sufi's do because the Sufi poets...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got form, worship, the Sufis?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They don't worship form as such, but they ah, they speak of it in the poetry. They say ah...in one point (indistinct) There is a meeting between (indistinct) and his spiritual master. And he asked the spiritual master (unknown language). I asked, He asked what was this current, this chain of idols that we must worship? And he replied, "So that my heart might, might mourn, lament, the dark night."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The dark night?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The dark night of ignorance...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, darkness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...of separation from God. So that they use the form of expression, worship...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Separation, how it is possible? Separation is expressed when there is separation between man to man, man to woman. First, otherwise what is the meaning of separation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Separation from his divine...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then it must be person. They do not believe in the Personality of Godhead?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They believe, the Sufis, see the personality of Ali.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not talking of the Sufis, I am talking of the original Islam.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Sufis claim to be the original process.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they, all the Muslims accept them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> There are about 780 different schools of Islam, different ideas they have.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to take the original, otherwise mislead.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think the original path must be found in Sufism, it can be because that is the essence...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the original path is followed, why it is named Sufism?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Because there were those who had fallen away from it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There are those who had fallen away from it. Just as in the Hindu...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has fallen, Islam or the Sufis?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think the formalists have fallen away like the <i class="calibre3">jñānīs</i> in Hinduism. Just as there is a dispute between the Śaivites and the Vaiṣṇavites.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has fallen? The original Islam or the Sufis?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Sufis are the original Muslims.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Sufis are the original Muslims.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sufis or (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sufis are the original ah...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are original cult?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, the Sufis.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before Mohammed?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, springing from Mohammed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how you can say it is original.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, it is original. All the schools of law they develop...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is original, why it is named different?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Because there are those that have fallen away from it and they are the ones who use this name. The Sufis don't use this name for themselves, it's used by others who wish to condemn them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning of Sufism, literal meaning?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, Sufism in a sense is ah, what bhaktism is in the Hindu context.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Bhakti</i> means to offer service to God. Does it mean?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, absolutely!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if God is to be served, then He must be a person, otherwise where is the question of serving?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, the Sufis do see that, the personal aspect of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless one is person, how can I serve him? I cannot serve the air or the sky. I must serve a person. Love does not exist in the sky or in the air. There must be a person, man or woman, it doesn't matter. Otherwise, where there is love? Whom to love?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The Sufis find love in these figures. For example, the Sufis in (indistinct) through the face of a beautiful woman.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Face of beautiful woman, then the materialists also find.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's a material aspect, actually.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, Islam religion, (indistinct) reject it (indistinct). As soon as they think of form, they think of this material form, beautiful face of woman. That is degradation. Therefore, we are strict not to conceive material form. That is Vedic conception. <i class="calibre3">Apāni-pādo javano grahitā.</i> "He has no legs, no hands." This is denying the form. Next he says, <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> says, <i class="calibre3">javana grahitā</i>. "He can accept whatever you offer to Him." That means He has, God has, no material form, but He has form, otherwise how He can accept it? How I can understand by love? So, therefore the original Islam the form is not accepted. That is Vedic description, form and formless. Formless means no material form and form means spiritual form, simultaneous. Just like I am, you are, I am within the body, but I am not this body. This form, I am not I am, but what from the form of the body has come into existence? Because I have got form. The sweater has got hand, because I have got hand. The sweater is the covering. If I haven't got form, then how the sweater has got hand, the pant has got leg? But the pant practically is not the leg, the real leg is within the pant. Similarly, this is not my form, this is like pant, leg of the pant or hand of the coat. Real form is within. <i class="calibre3">Asmin dehe</i>. That is not material form. If the real form I could see, you could see, then there would be no controversy, but they cannot see. Therefore, they say "formless". If it is formless then how the outward form comes about? How it can be? The tailor makes the coat because the man has got form. As the coat has got hand, so it is concluded that the man for whom the coat is made he has got form. How you can say without form? The difficulty is that we can see the form of the coat but we cannot see the form of the man. That is my defect in the eyes, not that the God is formless. God is not formless.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> God is seen in the form of the saints.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> God is seen in the form of the saints.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another, that is second maybe, but God has got form. That is the conclusion, but we cannot see with the present eyes. That is described, <i class="calibre3">ataḥ śrī-kṛṣṇa-nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ</i> [<i class="calibre3">Brs</i>. 1.2.234]. By your, these blunt senses.... Same thing, just like I see you, but I see your body. You see me, my body, and.... But the body is there, and the soul is not there then it is lump of matter and you kick it out, nobody will protest. If a dead body is smashed with your legs or boots, nobody will say (indistinct). But so long the soul is there, if somebody is smashed like that, immediately they will protest. (indistinct). So people have no knowledge about the real form, therefore they say formless.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When the body changes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, does that mean that also that the real form changes?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Because the body...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, body changes but the spiritual form is the same.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He is always the same. How is it that when our coat, size of the coat, changes because the body grows bigger the size of the coat is bigger?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is spiritual form. You can take.... It can become bigger, smaller, like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the form is the same.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What is filling the body is consciousness. The consciousness...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may have a big coat or small coat, overcoat, the form is the same. But for convenience (indistinct) or small coat. This has been, body has been, described as the dress so the form of the dress cannot be there unless there is form of the person who puts on the dress. How can I deny it? Because the dress has got form, the person who puts on the dress must have form. How can I deny this argument? You cannot say formless. Maybe you cannot see, that is the way, but the person must be form. That is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>. Kṛṣṇa says, "Arjuna, you and Me and all these persons who are here, they are existing like that in the past, they are now existing, and (indistinct), they will always be (indistinct)."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is Kṛṣṇa.... Can one say that Kṛṣṇa is the form that presents itself, of Godhead that presents itself to man and Bhagavān is the essential aspect?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhagavān, yes, the original.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The same as Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the sun. The sunshine is very big, but the sun globe is not so big. But which is the form, the sunshine or the sun globe?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But its the glow which reaches man because...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, these are examples.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He can't really touch the globe because he would be consumed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, qualitative change. But if, there are five elements. It is made of fire, that's all. As your body is made of earth, that sun globe or sun god's body is made of fire. There are other planets also, the body is made of air. Because you do not find more than these five elements-earth, water, air, fire, sky-gross and subtle-mind, intelligence. So, subtle, the same gross, somewhere fire is prominent, somewhere water is prominent, air is prominent, somewhere earth is prominent. So here in this world, in this planet, the earth is prominent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So, there is a distinction between permanent and the eternal?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prominent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, prominent, ah ha.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The earth is prominent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ah ha. It's the prominent form in this material world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> On this earth, on this planet...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> On this planet.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...earth is prominent amongst the five elements.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole world, whole universe, they are made of these five elements.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) of the five elements.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What is the fifth besides earth, air, fire and water?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What is the fifth element after earth, air, fire and water?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ether.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Ether. How does ether distinguish...?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sky. Ether is, presence of ether, by sound.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How is ether distinct from air?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How is ether distinct from air?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ether you cannot feel touch, (in) air you can feel touch.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Different sense perceptions. On this planet the bodies are made of earth. But there are other places on the planets, where the physical body is composed of different combinations. Say one is predominately air, another can be fire, another watery.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But is ether a gross element as well?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Space.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, space.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> It is space.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So, in that sense it's a gross element.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> It's perceivable by the senses as sound.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> As sound.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ether is perceived by sound. Air is perceived by touch. Then? Ether, air....</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Fire and water.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then fire...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You can see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see by vision. Then next?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Water.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water, you can taste and the earth you can smell. Five senses to appreciate these five (indistinct) Alright.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
