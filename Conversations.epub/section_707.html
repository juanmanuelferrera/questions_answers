<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They kept dead body frozen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It hasn't become very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why? The scientists' failure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Maybe people don't believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is made by the scientists. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...behind the frozen body was that if someone had an incurable disease, they thought that they could suspend the life by freezing it, and then, when they found the cure for the disease, they would unfreeze him or thaw him out and cure him of his disease so that he could live again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these childish activities are taken as scientific advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is there a Vedic definition of science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vijñāna. Jñāna-vijñāna.</span> [break] ...not this science, experimental. That is not science. Vedic knowledge is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So there is no experimental science in Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Experimental science is condemned. What you will make, ex... You are imperfect. What is the value of your experiment? Therefore it is rejected. Whatever you'll do, that is imperfect. First of all you become perfect; then you make experiment. But you are... You remain imperfect, and you making experiment. What is the value of it? [break] ...is no experimental knowledge. All established truth. That is <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> or science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Established truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The sun rises on the eastern side; that is established truth. You cannot change it. And that is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> Man dies. This is established truth. You cannot make any change by experimental knowledge. This is <span class="Italic">vijñāna. Nṛpa nirnita:</span> "It is already settled." In the Vedic knowledge there is no such thing as laboratory or experiment, discovery, nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People blindly would accept that cow dung was purified without having to test it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you make experiment; you will find it all right. So we save time. [break] ...no experiment. [break] ...experiment has become successful? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they've cured certain diseases by experimentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is success? You stop disease. What is this, "cure disease"? Malaria, if it is not here, it is somewhere there. And if I am not suffering from malaria, I am suffering from syphilis. So what is this cure, experiment? Disease must be there. So you stop it. Then it is success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it is not possible to stop disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it worthwhile to try to prolong life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is also condemned. Prolonged life... Suppose you live hundred years and a tree lives five thousand years, ten thousand years. Then what is the use of prolonging life, life like this? Is that very good life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Standing in one place for ten thousand years? Why should you prolong your life? For suffering? You are suffering, that is your problem, so what is the use of prolonging your life? This is foolishness. What do you gain by prolonging life if you are suffering? Stop suffering. That is wanted. How you can stop suffering? With suffering, prolonging life, what is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just means more, longer suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And even if you prolong life, how long you'll prolong? There are trees. They are thousand times prolonging than your life. In... What is called? San Francisco, the Golden...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Redwood trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Redwood trees. One redwood, already seven thousand years old, they told me. So what is the benefit, seven thousand years standing in one place, very long? Hm? What is the benefit? You are trying to prolong life. Very good idea. But what is the use of prolonging life while suffering? One side, you are trying to prolong life; the other side, for acute suffering, one is committing suicide. So why this contradictory proposal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, only some people commit suicide. As far as I'm concerned, I'm very happy. I have my car, my air conditioner...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you are fool number one. That means you are fool number one. As soon as you say, "I am happy," it is immediately proved that you are a rascal, fool number one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But everyone is afraid of death. They don't like the idea of dying. Put if off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore, you cure that first of all; then prolong life that there will be no death. Then you prolong life is... Make some understand. Can go this side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So it's not possible that anyone's happy? There is no possibility of anyone being happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. One who thinks he is happy, he is number one fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone is searching after material happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But there is no happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What about if one is in the mode of goodness? Maybe one or two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mode of goodness... If he thinks that he is happy, then he is fool. The mode of goodness means one must know that we cannot be happy here. That is mode of goodness. And if he thinks, "I am happy," then he is not in mode of goodness. He's in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So everyone at present is trying to become happy by this or that activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are fools, rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if everyone accepts that there is no happiness at all to be found in this world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then what to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārtham...</span> Therefore you go to guru. Go to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Do I have to join your movement to be happy? Can I just take Kṛṣṇa consciousness outside your movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So there is no possibility of me being Kṛṣṇa conscious outside your movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be developed with devotees. Alone it is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If I start my own community outside the movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The community means many devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you were saying, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if there is no happiness and one recognizes it, then he goes to guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he must... Just like Arjuna submitted to Kṛṣṇa because he was disturbed. So that is the point where one must approach a guru, how to become happy. That is intelligence. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>:</span> "Now inquire about real happiness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So one who is looking for material happiness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...it is very difficult for them to approach guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a fool, rascal, blind. Where there is happiness not possible, he is trying to find out happiness. Therefore he is a fool. Which is not possible, if one tries for it, then he is fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I look around and I see everybody else enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are fool, you are seeing like that. That is the proof that you are a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They all tell me what a great time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">,</span> and you are finding out happiness. Then how much fool you are. The best authority says that "This is a place of suffering," and you are finding out happiness. So how much fool you are, it is very difficult to estimate. (laughter) Therefore Vedic knowledge is perfect. Now just like there is signboard, "No admission." So who is the fool, create some trouble by entering into it? He's a fool. If there is signboard, "There is no admission," and if somebody enters to create some trouble, he is not a fool? So Kṛṣṇa says, "There is no happiness," and if somebody searches happiness, he is not a fool? That is... Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness required, that he gets perfect knowledge from Kṛṣṇa. He has no trouble. Kṛṣṇa said, "There is no happiness," and if somebody thinks, "All right, although Kṛṣṇa said, let me try for it," then he is a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Similarly, they say that they can cure disease, but it's impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is possible? The disease is suffering, and this place is suffering, so where is the question of curing disease? Kṛṣṇa consciousness means intelligence. We are guided by Kṛṣṇa, so there is no trouble. Everything is all right. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And as soon as you make experiment like fools and rascal, then you are doomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Well, my guru, Meher Baba, tells me, 'Don't worry. Be happy.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is another fool, another rascal, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He didn't even speak. He didn't speak for so many years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This Meher Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he was your guru? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He says, "Don't worry. Be happy, and just love me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And he died of motor accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He died in motor accident?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. He was killed by a car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Don't worry, I am going to die by motor accident. Don't worry. Don't worry. I am going to die by motor accident." All these rasals, they have misled the whole world. What is this raised ground?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is where they hit the golf ball from, raised up. This is the men's teeing part. And the ladies' teeing part, they tee off from here, little bit shorter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No equal right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No equal rights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, all the swamis are saying that all you have to do is just be happy. It's just a state of being. You just have to think happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we also say, but you must know how to get happiness. That is required. Happiness is the aim of everyone. But how to get happiness, permanent, that is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is a devotee seeking mental happiness as well? Is the devotee searching after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee does not seek anything except service of Kṛṣṇa. He does not seek anything separate. He simply wants to serve Kṛṣṇa. That's all. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣita śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Making zero all other desires, that, he is devotee. If he is going to Kṛṣṇa for some happiness, he is not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...Vedic culture, there is descriptions of many demigods, and the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they would generally worship these different demigods for material benefits. Why didn't they just try to get the material benefits without worshiping the demigods, like they are doing today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Today people are making money and trying to enjoy material life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is making money? Who is making money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The government. It is printing it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think everyone is making money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it's a big illusion? It's a big illusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone simply working hard like asses. That's all. This is their happiness. Just like the hog, he's working very hard to eat stool, and he is thinking happy. He is getting fatty. Do you think to work hard day and night and eat stool is happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he is thinking; therefore he is getting fat. You generally find the pigs are fatty because they think, "Oh, I am very happy." Yes. One man gets fatty when he thinks that "I am very happy." You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is psychology. When he thinks, "I am very happy," he gets fatty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But if I think I'm happy, isn't that enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think. That is another thing. But you do not know what is happiness. These rascals, they do not think that what is happiness. Suppose I have arranged for so-called happiness. Then I am going to die also. Who will enjoy this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I'm not worried about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proof that you are a rascal. "Fools rush in where angels dare not." That is the proof. The hog is thinking, "I am very happy." Therefore he is hog. He is not a human being. Hog proves that he is hog by thinking that "I am very happy. I am getting fatty." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...suffer. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That's a fact. So why is it that people are thinking they are happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have repeatedly said. Therefore, because they are thinking like that, therefore they are rascals. That is the proof. There is no happiness; still, he is thinking, "I am happy." That is the proof that he's a rascal. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, we can admit that we're not happy all the time, but what is the meaning of happiness without distress? If there's no distress, how can I be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is material knowledge. In order to taste happiness, you have to suffer. That is material happiness. And happiness, pure, is spiritual happiness. Here, in order to enjoy happiness, you have to suffer; then you can taste. Therefore that is not real happiness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A sandtrap. This is where the ball goes in and it's very difficult to hit it out of there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So you're not supposed to hit it in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It makes it more difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes they hit a golf ball, Śrīla Prabhupāda, two hundred yards, and it goes into the hole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing. In order to feel the happiness of playing, he has to go in this way. It is unhappiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Such standard of religion the Western countries are not used to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is religion in Western countries? There is no religion. All bogus thing. Religion means to surrender to God. Then where is God, and whom to surrender? They surrender to senses, that's all. So unless there is God, what is the meaning of religion? That is not religion. They have created something, civilized human society. There must be some religion. Just like aristocracy means he must have a good dog, that's all. There is no religion in the world except Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What is the Pope doing, then? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's another big bogus man. The Pope's assistant died in the prostitute's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Paris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The Pope comes out on his balcony, and thousands of people cheer and scream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing, that small animals praising the big animals, that's all. At least they say something about God. They are not zero, but they have no clear conception of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But everyone is thinking that their religion is the best. Even the Christian may be ignorant, even the Jew may be ignorant, anyone-doesn't matter-they're thinking that theirs is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proof that everyone is fool. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all... Therefore we have to understand from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> that what is real religion. Real religion means love of Godhead. So instead of love of Godhead, the love of doghead is increasing. So where is religion? Everybody should keep a dog and serve him, and where is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, they think that God is in the other world, so that in this world we can serve our wife and family, and when we go to the other world we'll serve God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then God is separated from this world. How much imperfect knowledge it is. God has created this world, and He has nothing to do with. Just see. They say God created this world, but He has nothing to do with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a very imperfect understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...you were with Meher Baba?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, I was never with Meher Baba. (laughter) I just bring up all these points just so you can defeat them. I was with Maharishi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maharishi? Oh. You got his <span class="Italic">mantra</span>? How much you paid for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Thirty-five dollars. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what was the <span class="Italic">mantra</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Aing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Aing"? That's all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's all. And they told me, "Never tell anybody else, 'cause if you tell somebody else the whole thing is ruined."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are also ruined? No, he is also ruined? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything ruined means he also ruined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> For you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes, that Maharsi Baba. Because he gave the <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> so if you disclose it, everything is ruined including himself. He is also ruined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He can't sell any more <span class="Italic">mantras</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> When I joined the movement I met many other devotees who also had <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> So I said, "What were your <span class="Italic">mantras</span>?" They were telling us we all had different mantras. And everybody had the same <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> It was the same thing. Everyone had the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how he was cheating you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I purchased mine.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is such a great cheater, and he has opened university? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I used to ask, "What is the goal of all this?" And they would always say, "You can't ask that now. You won't understand. In the future we'll tell you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "After we have your money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They keep it very mystical so that you keep thinking in the future you'll get something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same as the scientists, same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, Prabhupāda, by your mercy we've been able to see that the whole world is simply cheaters and cheated.</div>
