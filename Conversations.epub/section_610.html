<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...July 3rd, July 4th not the same body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> Still, they will say that there's still no reason...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will say so many nonsense. Who is going to take it? They are rejected as nonsense. Anyone who is a speculator, he is a nonsense because he has no standard knowledge. Next day they will say, "Oh, no, this is not. This is." They are doing that. That is not knowledge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We were discussing in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> class last night that during our life we are changing our bodies so many different times, and at the time of death we are also changing our body to another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you get another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What is the difference of changing our body during our lifetime and at death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is... I have said many times. Just like you are using this shirt, and it is not usable, you throw it and again accept another. [break] ...understand this is a difficult problem. (laughs) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> ...second we are dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dying means changing body, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> So we're changing bodies all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is going on. You will find it. A creeper is growing. Today she, it is, leaf has grown so much, and next moment you'll see, it has grown so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> [break] ...that asparagus that you eat, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That will grow two inches in one night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Very quickly. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> ...the same body, but just the parts are changing. They say that it's not actually the whole body that's changing, but just you're changing parts like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. "Parts are changing, the body is not changing." Just see. (laughter) Just rascaldom. "Parts are changing, body is not changing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Suraśreṣṭha:</span> Just like a car-you take spark plugs and put new spark plugs in, but still, it's the same car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the whole parts are changing, then where is the original body? When the whole parts are changed, then it is to be concluded the body is changed. There are so many parts. If this is changed, this is changed, this is changed, then where is the original body? (laughter) Just see their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Parts make up the whole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "The parts are changing, the whole is not changing." Just see. Therefore we say rascals only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Suraśreṣṭha:</span> They say that the brain stays the same, that the brain cells never...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore take them as rascal. Everything is changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You brain is the same as it was when you were an infant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> They say that there's new information coming in, but the brain cells don't die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The memory, the memory is staying the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> [break] You had said on a... earlier on a morning walk, on a tape, that if one enters into the spiritual world that-you were asked that he will never have to return-and you said that if it's a desire, he can return to the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I was just wondering if the spirit soul being in the spiritual world is eternally liberated, how can he return. By desire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If he desires, he can come again. That option is always there. Just like I remain in India. I come here. And if I like, I may not come. It is my option.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> When we get to the spiritual sky, we'll always be able to remember how horrible it is down here? We'll always be able to remember how terrible it is in the material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is terrible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, we will be able to remember that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence. When one remembers that this world is <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">,</span> is a place of misery, then we can go. As long as we shall think, "Oh, it is very nice place," we have to remain. Kṛṣṇa is so kind, "All right, remain in this very nice place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You gave the example yesterday of Lord Indra. When he took birth here as a hog, then he didn't want to leave. He thought it was nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he also thought it is a very nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kāśīrāma:</span> Queen Kuntī was always praying that the calamities would happen again and again so that she would remember Kṛṣṇa. If the calamities are always happening in the material world, we will realize it is a terrible place to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> knowledge. When one comes to this conclusion, "This is worthless," that is <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> knowledge. And so long one will think, "No, it is not always bad, sometimes very good," that is ignorance. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> They say that without the bad, then the good wouldn't be as good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you remain with bad and good. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. That possibility is here. Sometimes you are going to the higher heavenly planets, a long duration of life, better standard of enjoyment-again coming back. [break] Good and bad is exemplified: just like I catch you and put down the water, and when you are suffocated, I raise you little, and you say, "Oh. (laughter) It is very nice." But you do not know, again you are going to be... You see? "This good, bad" is here like that. He is put into the water and suffocated, and when he is taken out little, he says, "Oh, it is very good. It is very good." The rascal does not know, the next moment he is going to be again drowned in that. That is going on. <span class="Italic">Daṇḍya-jane rāja-jana...</span> That was the chief punishment formerly. If one has to be punished, instead of putting into the jail and feed him, the officers will take him to a river and put him in the water. In this way, one day doing, he will say "I will never do these things. Please excuse me." <span class="Italic">Daṇḍya-jane rāja-jane nadite cubaya.</span> [break] ...unless one remembers this, that "To be in the material world, how suffocating it is," he will not fit for going to back to Godhead. He must be completely detestful. If he keeps little attachment, "No, it is very good sometimes," then you have to remain here. [break] "This is not permanent. I shall be put next moment in the bad condition." That he must know. That is knowledge. And if he makes compromise, then he has to be again... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> ...consciousness part of this life, up to the time of death, in our next life we will be put in a situation immediately where we can take up Kṛṣṇa consciousness again or will we have to suffer <span class="Italic">karma</span> before we came into Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will get Kṛṣṇa conscious again. <span class="Italic">Yoga-bhraṣṭaḥ sañjāya... Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭaḥ sañjāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> A Kṛṣṇa conscious person will be given all comforts of material life so that he may regain without any botheration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> Sometimes it is stated that Kṛṣṇa will take everything away from the devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is special favor, (laughter) that "This rascal is again attached. Take all his..." That is special favor. That is not ordinary favor, so that when everything is taken away, he will completely surrender to Kṛṣṇa, "Kṛṣṇa, I have nothing except You."</div>
<div class="Verse">tumi binā ke āche āmara</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I have nothing." That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> Once one performs devotional service then he can't get away from Kṛṣṇa. Can he still get away? It seems like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that option is always, because you are independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> I see with myself that if I try to get away a little bit, He beats me so much that I have to come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is special favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is directly controlling that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When He sees, "That fool wants Me, at the same time, material world. So take his material possession, everything, so that he will want only Me, that's all." Actually, it was done to me. (laughs) I have got practical experience. I did not want to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> I thought that I shall do business. And Kṛṣṇa forced me to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and all, everything, dismantled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Kṛṣṇa's mercy on us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> But your business was successful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was thinking of becoming Birla, but I am now more than Birla. This is Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Birla gives you money now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only that, how many branches Birla has? It is an example, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if a devotee gets sick, should he go and take medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Better not to take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Just depend on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is very good. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> Rosehips. (Horse hips(?) Forceps(?))</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> You said the other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we should take care of disease if it comes. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita was also saying fire and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Fasting is one way of eliminating the disease without taking medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is a Indian proverb that "Disease and unwanted guest, if you don't give food, they will go away." If some guest has come whom you do not want, don't give him food. Then he will go away. (laughter) Similarly, disease, if you fast, it will go away. [break] ...another story: <span class="Italic">prahareṇa dhanañjaya.</span> One gentleman had eight or nine daughters and son-in-law. So when they came, he was giving them good food and shelter, everything. So then they saw, "We are very comfortably living at father-in-law's expense." So they did not want to go. The father-in-law saw, "It is very dangerous that all the son-in-laws are not going." Then he began to... First day he did not supply salt. So one son-in-law say, "Oh, they are now disrespecful, they have not given salt." So one went away. And next day, something else, something else, something else, shortened, shortened. So those who were intelligent, they went away. The last one, he was not going. Then his brother-in-laws thought that "Give him good beating." Then he went away. <span class="Italic">Prahareṇa dhanañjaya.</span> Others, those who were intelligent, they, when they thought that "Now there is disrespectful dealing, they are not giving everything," so they gradually... The last one, he was a rascal. He was beaten severely; then he went away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So if we're beaten by this material nature, then we'll go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes. No, material nature's business is beating and kicking. That's his only business. But we are so fool, we are taking, "Oh, very nice kicking." That is the disease. We accept the kicking as very nice. That is foolishness. We are suffering always by three kinds of..., <span class="Italic">ādhyātmika, ādhibhautika, ādhidaivika</span> disturbances. There is disturbance in the body, in the mind, disturbance by other living entities, so many, disturbed by climate, disturbed by famine. Always disturbance. Still, we are thinking, "It is very nice place." This is foolishness. Still, we are trying to improve it. That is foolishness. He does not think that "What is the meaning of improvement? The disturbing is always continuing." That does not come to his brain. They are making improvement. [break] ...improvement, they can say, "This is improvement." But how long this improvement will go? If there is no rainfall, what this improvement will help? So that is not in your hand. That is <span class="Italic">ādhidaivika.</span> It depends on the demigods. If they want, they can stop completely, no rainfall. Then what this improvement will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There'll be no water for their machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they are thinking that "This is improvement." What is this nonsense improvement? You are dependent fully on other elements. What improvement will do? And Kṛṣṇa says, "This is a place for misery." How you will improve? This is folly, this is illusion. Kṛṣṇa says, "This place is for suffering," and you are making improvement. "Yes, we are advancing. In future we shall live. Nobody will die." Therefore they are called rascals. Persons who are trying to do something which is impossible, they are fools. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> They do not see, still, they hope, "Yes, we are trying. We shall do in future." This is going on. This is the example by the ass. The ass... Driver is sitting on the back of the ass and showing one bunch of grass, and the ass is thinking, "I will get it." (laughter) And he is going on, and he is sitting safely, that "The ass will go on." So our improvement is like that. "Just little forward, then I shall get the grass." He will never get the grass. That he has no brain, that "I am improving; the grass also improving, going on." That they do not see. Now we invented so many airship. It was thought, "Oh, now it will be very nice. Within two hours we shall reach somewhere." Now there are so many dangers. Now there is problem, how to protect us from these accidents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Now they have too many airplanes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too many airplanes. So where is the improvement? Improvement means to die altogether two hundred men at a time. This is improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kuruśreṣṭha:</span> They are trying to create a plastic body with plastic heart transplants and plastic liver. They feel that as soon as they can replace all the breakable parts with replaceble ones...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a Frankenstein? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They're very persistent, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the foolishness. Fools are very persistent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I was reading that in order to go to the moon, it took ten years and the cost was 25 billion dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how foolish they are. And again they are trying. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Chewing the chewed. This is their business. Horrible civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kāśīrāma:</span> Mistaking suffering for happiness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They are always trying to look for the bright side, but there is no bright side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like north of Sweden, there is no sunrise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is bright side? Where is bright side? Vedic injunction is <span class="Italic">tamasi mā jyotir gama:</span> "Don't remain in this darkness; go to the bright world." <span class="Italic">Jyotir gama.</span> [break] ...to create some bright side. He will not be allowed to enjoy it. He will have to die. So where is your bright side? [break] ...for preparing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> For the moon? 25 billion dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So again I am trying to go another planet. Where is the guarantee that it will be successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> On the contrary, if they failed once, then we should think that they would fail again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is animalism. A dog is coming, and you show him some stick or beat him. He will go away for the time being. Again he will come. That is dog. He doesn't get lesson by one. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Repeating the same thing again and again. That is animalism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> They actually think that they were successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless they say, how they will adjust so much money spent? What account they will give? They must bluff, "Yes, it is successful." I saw in the Allahabad high-court. One man was condemned to death. I told you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one barrister, Mr. Allston, he was pacifying, "Don't worry, I shall appeal and get you released. Don't worry." (laughter) I heard it. I was passing, and Mr. Allston was advising his client. He was morose. "Don't worry, I shall appeal and get you released." [break] ...condemned person was a medical man, and he killed his servant in the surgical room because the servant was implicated with his wife. This is the story. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And the man was also Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But the barrister, he was English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was appointed because he was a big barrister. Formerly any European, he is very big. So he appointed a very big barrister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, he was a rich Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How he could get such a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a medical man. Yes, rich, rich. [break] ...they have arranged to have the meeting with this Professor Dimmock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I didn't ask. They were supposed to do it. (end)</div>
