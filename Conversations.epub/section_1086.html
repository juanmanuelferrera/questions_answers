<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Mr. Tombe (M.L.A.)<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 25, 1976, Bombay</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Tombe:</span> After all, even if it is thrown out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also answered in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> by very strong word. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the public is like dogs, camels, hogs, and asses, so what is the value of their election? He'll elect another big dog or camel. So there is chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Tombe:</span> Then how to throw out good leadership?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Good leadership means you must learn how to lead people. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha,</span> the leader is ideal, then others will follow. But if the leader is not ideal, if he is not in the awareness of things, then people will be misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Tombe:</span> So how can we chalk out a program of, say, training of leaders from the villages...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have to take lessons from the biggest leader, Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's the leader of the demigods also. We have to take lesson from... That lesson is there, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But we do not take it. We manufacture our leadership. That is the defect. What Kṛṣṇa said... Everyone is proud of reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but the purpose of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is how to kill Kṛṣṇa, that's all. That is their... All these. What can I say? These misleaders, they are doing that. Leadership is already there. Kṛṣṇa. Just like Arjuna is learning from Kṛṣṇa. So if you learn from Kṛṣṇa you become perfect leader. But we do not take Kṛṣṇa's instruction. We manufacture our own ideas. That is failure. Otherwise in our country so many learned sages, especially Kṛṣṇa is there, and their books are there, their instructions are there. We do not take them. Still we become leader. So what kind of leading? He's imperfect. So he cannot lead. Then there will be some mistake and chaos. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu said... He said <span class="Italic">bhārata-bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> You understand little Bengali?</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So Indians, they can make their life perfect by following this Vedic literature, and they can lead the whole world. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's. First of all you become perfect by taking lessons from the Vedic literature. And then you do good to others. But without making yourself perfect, if you try to do good to others, that is chaos. Then again comes, <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Some blind men following another blind man. What will be the result? The present Indians, we have lost our own culture. We have rejected our own culture. Still we are leading people. There is chaotic condition. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to correct this mistake. So leaders like you should cooperate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Tombe:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then things will be perfect. India, if the whole world can be saved from this chaotic position, India can do. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. But that India leaders first of all make his life perfect. Then it will be all right. Just like our... Of course, I'm not proud, but I am alone. I started this movement alone, without any help. But because I am giving them the perfect information, whole world is taking it. Otherwise, from practical point of view, one man without any help, within ten years he cannot do like this. That's a fact. But I have no difficulty because I am following the Supreme Leader, Kṛṣṇa. People may say that I've done wonderful, but there is nothing magic. Because I am following Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Leader, so far it has become successful. So everyone can do that. Where is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> If we follow the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system it is not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are all of Prabhupāda's books. Eighty books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighty-four books we have, I have written within ten years. And our publication house, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the first in the world for publishing religious and philosophical books. We are selling not less than six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> worth books daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, publishing division.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Tombe:</span> I have got only a few of them now. I would like to pick up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here, these are... We only have sample copies in India. So I'll tell Girirāja to bring you some. These are only sample copies for Prabhupāda's display. (end)</div>
