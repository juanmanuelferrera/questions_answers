<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This is a family from Corsica.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> boys met them when they were distributing in Corsica.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Mr. Marchand, and the girl, his wife, and little girl and boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Bhagavān dāsa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mrs. Marchand and children:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you. Thank you. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> thank you, <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Thank you</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Oh, you have painted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> A lady from Corsica, she gave me that, and she took your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and also she gave me that for your work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Mr. Marchand is a commander in the French Navy. Now he and his family are all chanting on beads and following the regulative principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You retired? Or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He's still active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> Still has a few years to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arjuna was a commander.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Have they seen our French <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>? Our new French <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we generally speak that Arjuna was military commander. So before understanding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he was commander, and after understanding, he remained a commander, but he became Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He says this brings to mind a question to him, that now that he has received Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he would like to know from you how he should behave in his normal life, because he'll be living very far from the temple. He's two thousand kilometers away from us, and he wants to know how his life should be conducted now that he has become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Ninth Chapter. The whole <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> he has to study, he'll understand. Especially in the Ninth Chapter. Beginning from Seventh to... All the chapters, especially Seventh to Twelfth chapter. He can open that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Seventh Chapter. French.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> This is French, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śrī bhagavān uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(reads French translation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if he has got any difficulty to understand? Ask him. And purport is there. If there is any difficulty, he can inquire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He says he admires you very much for the work you have done in spreading this message all around, and especially the fact that you have made it so clear that anyone can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him come, join, and help. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He says as much as he can he will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why as much? Why not fully? (laughter) The sooner he helps fully... (someone comes in) Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya, haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Punjab National Bank has not sent the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Just like in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If possible, we can talk or... Is it possible to talk with the manager? Punjab National Bank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, yes. Call him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was to send by registered post, but I have not received. You gave the address and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, yes, I wrote it down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Was he bona fide manager or not? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He didn't have his seal with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyway, just inquire. These are our garden flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anything grown in the garden, that is hundred times valuable than it is purchased from the market. (pause) <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is a book which can guide the whole human society. In all different branches of knowledge, namely in politics, in sociology, in religion, in culture, in philosophy, in economics, everything, all lines are described very vividly, and the human society can take advantage of it. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins in the battlefield with politics. And when Arjuna declined to fight, how Kṛṣṇa chastised him, that is described, <span class="Italic">kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame samupasthitam.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You tell him what Prabhupāda said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can ask him to open that book. Then read it. (translation read in French) So what is the difficulty in understanding? Ask him. This is military. Kṛṣṇa is asking that "You are in the battlefield. Wherefrom you got this cowardice mentality?" This is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Bhagavad-gītā</span> teaches how to become a brave hero in the battlefield. This is the instruction. <span class="Italic">Kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ viṣame sam.</span> Just read the purport. Is there any purport? (purport read in French) [break] ...difficulty to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He finds it very admirable that from a small verse you are able to always find something new and wonderful to say about it. And he say you go from verse to verse, and the complexity of what you explain is always new and wonderful to read. So he's very admiring of the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> How you can go from two lines to three pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can go more. (laughter) But I have made shortcut. Kṛṣṇa is unlimited. So He can be described unlimitedly. But we have no unlimited patience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He is explaining that there are so many things to understand about Kṛṣṇa, but we do not have the capacity to understand always. But he feels that at one point, when the soul is pure, these things will be understood automatically, but because we are very far, these commentaries are needed to bring us closer to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the first study of Kṛṣṇa. ABCD. When we learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then we can have some glimpse of idea of Kṛṣṇa. Then we go further in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He also admires very much that you have created disciples who are able to be very courageous in presenting your message. And that even though sometimes at first he was opposed to them, they were very peaceful always and always very nice to him, and this way they brought him slowly to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is preaching method. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena.</span> You can explain that:</div>
<div class="Verse">tṛṇād api sunīcena<br class="calibre2"/>taror api sahiṣṇunā<br class="calibre2"/>amāninā mānadena<br class="calibre2"/>kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Ādi 17.31]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the method by the preacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> A devotee should always feel lower than the straw in the street. (Mrs. Marchand speaks)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> She wants to know if it is recommended that a woman become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman should stay under the father, under the husband, and under the elderly sons. Nothing more. Therefore it is the duty of the father to give her in charge of a young man when she is young. This is Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> She's asking what should a woman do if she is alone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She cannot be alone. <span class="Italic">Na sataritatam ananti</span>(?). Woman should not be allowed... Just like children. Children cannot be alone. They must taken care of. Similarly a woman, in childhood, should be taken care of by the father; when she's young, she should be taken care of by the husband; and when she's old, she should be taken care of by elderly sons. You'll find in the Vedic literature, the father's responsibility is until she's handed over to a suitable young man. And the husband's responsibility is so long she hasn't got elderly children. At that time, when she has got elderly children, he can leave home and take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So the process is a woman is kept under protection always. There is no independence for woman. That is... Still, in India it is going on. The father is obliged to find out a suitable husband for the daughter and give her in his charge. Then his responsibility finished. Until that, she is, he's responsible to take care of the daughter. Unmarried girl to remain always under the protection of the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But today there seem to be so few qualified husbands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you do not train the boys to be qualified. You train them to become debauch. What can be done? You train them from <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> then they'll be responsible husbands. Both the girls and the boys should be trained up. Then they'll be responsible husband and wife and live peacefully. In their young days, if you give them freedom, they'll spoil. What can be done? Young, youthful days, if you give them full freedom, they'll be misguided and spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> She's asking that since in these Western countries the families are so broken up and the women sometimes cannot find a qualified husband, what should she do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, here is the society. You train them. You have got all children. You train them in that way, so that... Whatever is done is done. Now you can make very good society, Kṛṣṇa conscious society. Not that one mistake has been done, you should continue. Rectify it. The difficulty is the modern society, the leaders, they do not know the aim of life. They are blindly doing everything like animals. Their philosophy is like the animals. Eat, drink, be merry and enjoy, that's all. This is the philosophy of the animals. And human philosophy is to understand first of all what I am. I am this body or something else? That is human life. But nobody questions this, there is no institution to teach this science, therefore the whole human society is misguided. Just like if I want to train my boy to become a medical man, then I teach him biology, botany, similar... So if... Because I know I shall make my boy a medical man. Similarly, we should know what is the aim of human life. Then we have to construct the social political, everything, favorable to that end. But they do not know what is the aim of life. That is the whole mistake. I think that in Bible there is a story, prodigal son? So we are prodigal son. We are all sons of God, now we have become prodigal sons. What is the meaning of prodigal? "Without any responsibility," is it not? Do whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> Run away from the protection of the family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our position, that we are sons of God, we have given up protection of God. God is protecting in all circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It says "Prodigal: recklessly wasteful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. This is the... We are all recklessly wasteful sons of God. We are sons of God, there is no doubt, but at the present moment, recklessly wasteful. We are wasting our valuable life even, we are so reckless. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to check their recklessness and bring them into senses of responsibility, going back home, back to Godhead. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But people are so reckless, as soon as you say something of God, immediately they laugh, "Oh, what is nonsense, God." This is the supreme recklessness. India was very serious about God. Still, India is serious. Now, the present leaders, they are thinking that Indians are spoiled, simply thinking of God-they're not thinking like the Americans and Europeans for economic development. So this is the position, and it is very difficult, but still we can do something this to the humanity, by preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. And those who are fortunate, they'll come, take up seriously. These reckless prodigal sons, we have got so many examples. For example, just like there is some stock of petroleum and they got information that from petroleum they can run on cars without horse. So, manufacture millions of cars and spoil the whole oil. This is recklessness. And when it is finished, then they'll cry. And it will be finished. This is going on. Recklessness. Just as reckless boy, father has left some property, use it, use it. As soon as you get. The sooner it is finished, that's all. That is recklessness. There is some strength in the body, and as soon as he gets a little taste of sex life, "Oh, spend it, spend it," whole energy spent. The brain becomes vacant. This is recklessness. Beginning from twelfth year, by the thirty year, everything finished. Then he's impotent. In our childhood-in our childhood means, say, eighty years ago, or say, a hundred years ago-there was no motorcar. And now, wherever you go, in any country, you see thousands and millions of car. This is recklessness. Hundreds years ago they could do without motorcar, and now they cannot live without a car. In this way, unnecessarily, they're increasing bodily or material necessities of life. This is recklessness. And the leaders will say, "Stop this nonsense, come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness," nobody will care. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is called blind leader leading blind followers. They do not know that both of them are bound up by the strict, stringent laws of nature. [break] ...how the laws of nature is working. They are completely in ignorance. They do not know. This is modern civilization. The laws of nature must work in its own way. You care for it or do not care for it, that is your business, but the laws of nature will work. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> But these rascals, they do not know how the laws of nature will work. They are endeavoring artificially for, foolishly, to overcome the laws of nature. This is science, rascal's science, which is impossible, but they are trying. This is called rascaldom. Stupidity. Do the scientists not say like that? "We are trying to overcome." Rascal, you'll never be able to do that. But this rascaldom is going on. And they're applauding, "Oh, very good, very good, very good." "Oh, you are going to the moon planet." But after all endeavor, the grapes are sour: "It is not useful." That's all. You know the story? The jackal? He tried for the grapes, jumping, jumping, jumping. When it was failure, he said, "Oh, it is useless. It is sour, no use." (laughter) So they are doing like that. The jackals are jumping, that's all. And we can see how these rascals are jumping uselessly. (laughter) So we are warning people not to follow these silly jackals. Be prudent and be Kṛṣṇa conscious. That will make your life successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want to go for a walk now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This is Ulain. He is from the Ivory Coast in Africa. And he is very sincere, and he is also attempting to start Kṛṣṇa consciousness in Africa in the Ivory Coast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He had a question for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you remain here for some time. Be trained up. Because every one of us, we have followed the silly jackals. Now we have to follow Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's advice. First of all, let your personal life be successful, then try to do good to others. The, all over the world, they have simply followed the silly jackals. Now we have to follow Kṛṣṇa. When you are trained up to follow Kṛṣṇa, then our life is successful. Then you can do something. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to follow Kṛṣṇa alone. Not all these rascals, silly jackals. Then our life is successful. Kṛṣṇa can give you all guidance. In all respective necessities of life, there is everything complete. We haven't got to follow the silly jackals. So here is a nice place, you stay here and forget the silly jackals and take to Kṛṣṇa alone or His devotees. Then you can start very nicely a center anywhere. That is the duty of everyone. We should open hundreds and thousands of centers all over the world. But one who is going to open, he must be first of all trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He's wondering, he's convinced about Kṛṣṇa consciousness himself, but he is wondering why in a country or a continent like Africa, which is not so scientifically or technologically developed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no need of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> There is no need. So he is wondering why we only have two temples in Africa. Is it because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because language difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> Language difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, there is no difficulty. Still, even without language, without talking, if you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, everyone will follow. And give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> they will take. And that will be good preaching. It doesn't require language or anything. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and give them nice <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> They will take. That will be good preaching. But who is chanting, he must be a sincere devotee. Then his chanting will be effective. A gramophone machine will not do. He must be realized, then his chanting will be effective. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> He must behave just like a pure Vaiṣṇava. Then if he chants, his chanting will be effective. Just like electricity. If I am surcharged with electricity, I touch, you also become electric. And if he touches, he'll become. But if one is not in touch with electricity, then it will not act. So one must be electrified. Then if he touches somebody, he'll be electrified. If there is no electricity, simply by touching, he'll not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Translator:</span> He says that on the Ivory Coast, this country, until he becomes electrified, he knows that the President of the country is very favorable to our movement, he has the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and he thinks that we should open a temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately do it. Immediately do it. I am simply explaining the process. But do it immediately, Kṛṣṇa will give you power. If you are sincere, you'll be electrified. There is no doubt. So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Go for a walk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
