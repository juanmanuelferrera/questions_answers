<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> ...drafts Gopāla sent me, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Prabhu sent me were uncashable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Because he sent them first in one man's name who didn't cash them, or was instructed that he shouldn't do that, and he did by mistake. Then he sent them in my name and he sent them "account payee," and they wouldn't open an account without permission from the Reserve Bank of India. So that would have taken too long. So I've come... First I went to Calcutta, and I thought... I have the drafts. I thought maybe Gargamuni Swami could give me the <span class="Italic">lakṣmī,</span> the money. But he didn't want to do it. So now I'm here. I'm going to get it this morning and go back. I wrote a complete report for you, but I'll tell it to you. As far as the location goes, the location is a little bit off. I'm not that satisfied with it, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the location?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's on what's called Gangadwip. But that's new place. It's an island that just appeared this year, splitting the Ganges in two. You know, Jushi is here, and Gangadwip is here. And the place where we were last year is here. We were here last year, Gangadwip is here, and Jushi is here. And... But I've been sending out and going out on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> so that will make up for our location. It's not so bad, but I want to paint a true picture. It's not so good, nor is it so bad. And there's thirteen tents. We have three <span class="Italic">bigas</span> of land, sand. And we've made a tin enclosure all the way around. And we had a Swiss cottage tent for yourself. Swiss cottage means a room about this large from the end of the almirah to the wall and about this wide. And then a middle room about from here to the wall, and then another small room. But I was not satisfied with that, so I took that tent down, and when I left a day and a half ago I told Bhāgavata dāsa and Jagat-guru Mahārāja, who are there, to erect a straw house for you, bigger. So they are, I hope, doing that. The difficulty was that we had no money, and therefore I've come and am going back. I had a few hundred dollars in traveler's checks which I cashed and gave it to them to keep going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Straw house is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No? What would you like? Because a straw house retains the heat during the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but if there is fire it will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I see. We made a separate latrine for you and separate shower, etc. That is all enclosed. So what would you like? A big tent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know, but a straw house... Is there any chance of setting, getting fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, your kitchen is apart, in tin. So that... The kitchen would be safe. Otherwise why would there be any fire? The outside is also tin. There would only be your house. Now, I can make a tin house if you want, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, tin house will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Not so good. Straw is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is best, but fire protection-wise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, one thing I was thinking we can put <span class="Italic">shamiyanas</span> on the outside of it or the inside. I looked at the other camps, and most of the big <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> etc., they have straw houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Straw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Therefore I thought if they have, then you should have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right. But one gentleman wants to give us a house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Kapoor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, ha. Have you seen that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No. Not yet. I've been too busy. To get to any place you have to walk. But the first thing I did, I got a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why to walk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, I hired a autoscooter for the day, but there's so many things to do that since you had a place to live, I put that..., that I'm going to see it, but I didn't do it immediately. I went to see Munshi's camp though. Now, that is three miles away. That I walked to. It took one and a half hours to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One and a half hours!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> From our camp. And one and a half hours back. They kept on saying, "<span class="Italic">Sida, sida! Agi, agi!</span>" And finally I got there. And their camp is not nicer than ours. It would mean a saving of approximately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the cost of inconvenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But it wouldn't even save that much money, because our tents... When I got there, the one thing that was up, were our tents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the Mamford(?) Gandhi? Do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No. At Kapoor's house. I will go and see. Also Gopāla Kṛṣṇa mentioned a Ghosh. I'm going to get all the addresses from Jagadīśa prabhu and look into it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Dr. Ghosh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Dr. Ghosh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Ghosh is a little off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But Gopāla Prabhu said that you would rather live in our camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So then we'll make the best house we can for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Now, will you have blankets with you, or should we get everything there? I'll talk to you about it later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got my overcoat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's very cold. We'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can discuss it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Whatever is possible. So there's a couple of other points. Number one-because you were speaking about the devotees becoming like Rāvaṇa on the roof, we're doing our own cooking. I have our own men. And one assistant cook I hired for a hundred rupees. This assistant cook is a very nice man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He's so submissive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can cook my food in fifteen minutes, in so many varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> You used to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not fifteen, forty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> You used to do that in your cooker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I yesterday... Yesterday I did, and it was so nice. Everyone appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span> Well, you can do whatever you like. The cooks wanted things like 4,500 rupees with pots, and I said, "This is outrageous!" So, no. So now our own men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 4,500?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To hire a cook, hire some cooks, they want that much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Everyone is cheating for the <span class="Italic">Mela.</span> So I said, "No, no." So I said to our men, "We must do it." So I think we'll be able to do it. I preached to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, last year we were doing ourselves, our Swami... Who...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Who was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's well-known swami. I forget his name. Was in England?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Revatīnandana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Revatīnandana. No, Revatīnandana. Yes, Revatī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He was cooking. He's a good cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has cooked very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Anyway, I have three men cooking now and... So that will be all right. Now, the officials are cooperating with us nicely, of the <span class="Italic">Mela.</span> The other day Kamalapati Tripati was there, and we saw him, and all the officials were there, and he said, "Oh, hello! How are you? Everything all right?" And we said, "Yes." And it was a very nice conversation. And all the other officials saw that we were on friendly basis with the minister, so they were also more friendly. One unfortunate thing happened, a small unfortunate thing, a <span class="Italic">sukhi-duḥkhi.</span> We went to the <span class="Italic">saṅgam</span> with our <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> party during the time of the big..., the fifth bath. It's not the biggest one, but many pilgrims came. And we said we should chant and also bathe. So first we chanted. Then we went in for bath at four o'clock in the morning. Very refreshing, very nice. We went in, and we had our bath. Then we put our clothes on. We chanted, and we were very happy chanting. The police came, many police on horses, and said, "Get out!" And they were demons, like "Get out!" And I got a press pass. I said, "Why should we get out? We're only here to chant the holy names of God. This is a <span class="Italic">Mela.</span>" "Well, then," he said, "get out!" He's a demon, and he's taking his horse and pushing it on me and the other devotees. So he forced us out. So Bhāgavata dāsa went to the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> officials who we had some..., and complained. And the policeman was suspended and made a public apology. And now we have a letter that says we can chant any place we want in the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> with police cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is fortunate, fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, very good. A blessing in disguise, yes. So they're trying to organize. There's many <span class="Italic">bhangis</span> who pick up the stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The place is nice then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Oh, yes. And I cut down the <span class="Italic">pandal</span> size. Originally the <span class="Italic">pandal</span> was 100 by 150, 100 feet wide. But I saw that were going to emphasize <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and I measured that 120 by 75 was adequate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our visitors, they have got facility to come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. We have Life Member tents, and some visitors have been coming. I have been receiving them. So we have... There's one thing I wanted to ask you. A lot of youths are coming, Western youths, some hippies, but mostly clean. Some hippies. But there are two hippies, and I saw what they were like, and I didn't allow them to stay. But mostly our camp is... Until the devotees come, there are some tents that are empty. So they said, "We need a place to stay. Is it all right?" So I said, "Tonight you can stay. Then I'll let you know later on." And we preached to them. We have a morning program there, and we have an evening program. So they attended. So I thought with your permission I could erect some tents, not in our living area... The <span class="Italic">chokidhars</span> I put outside, right on the gate, because I didn't think they should live in our area, but they should be there, so the <span class="Italic">chokidhars</span> have a tent. I thought behind the <span class="Italic">pandal</span> I could erect some tents, or even behind our tin where people wouldn't see them so much, we could invite some guests, charge them something for living and preach to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. But they smoke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, some will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So, I mean it's up to... I'm asking what you think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will drink; they will smoke; they will not take bath. These are the defects. These people are unclean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Suppose they are willing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will spoil the cleanliness of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Of course, they would not be in our camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may be. But their, that association is very undesirable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, Yes. What if someone is willing to follow the regulations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First they should be shaved, clean-shaved. Will they accept that? They must take early in the water, take bath. Cleanliness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, they won't do. So I won't have that. I just thought it was a preaching opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching, if there is not clean even, what they will understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, when I came, I was not clean either. By your grace I cleaned up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They won't clean up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, no. I accept what, you know. I want to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People may not misunderstand that "This is hippie camp."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. The police were sending, and I went to the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> officials...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the police came. They thought that you are hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, I don't think, because this was before they came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, their association is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. So we won't have, definitely not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to make a good impression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that people may not think, "This is another edition of hippies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So we won't have at all. Now we have a general list of when everyone's big programs are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many are coming? Hippies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There's a lot. There's a lot. Well, yes, there's a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you consult amongst yourselves, but people may not have a bad impression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I think I will not do it because if you think there's any small chance of them associating with us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Alpa-chidre.</span> A small... White, white cloth and a small black spot, it becomes prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So we won't do it. We can try and preach to them at other place. Because we're going out on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> many times. We're getting a list of all the other programs in the <span class="Italic">Mela,</span> so we'll take our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> parties where it's going to be prominent and pass out literature. Now, for the meeting, for the resolution, I thought perhaps on the 16th or the 17th, because it is close to the big bathing day on the 14th and it won't conflict that much with other programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meeting means all other <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> they will meet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. I'm getting invitations printed up, and then we can write their names in, and I want to make the invitation something personal, like "This is a meeting of utmost importance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, some Swami Chand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Chandra Swami, minister for Air India. He's supposed to be wanting to see Prabhupāda. He's coming to the <span class="Italic">Mela.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I'll look into that. You told me last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is Indira Gandhi coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There's an unofficial rumor that Indira Gandhi's going to come. Speaking of politicians, I did some research on Tarun Kanti for the letter, and he's very preoccupied now, and Gargamuni Swami told me that he doesn't want to have anything to do with foreign funds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foreign funds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In other words, that letter would say, "I would oversee this." On the other hand, there's a man from CARE who went to our camp and was very impressed with the food program. I thought we could get a letter from him, because Germany knows CARE and they don't know Tarun Kanti Gosh from the <span class="Italic">dobi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So I thought CARE would be good, so Abhirama Prabhu is trying for that. Also I saw C. L. Bijaya yesterday when I was waiting to come here, and he was very happy to see me. And he said by your inspiration, "I want to give you that room downstairs."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> That room at the bottom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that will solve our great problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. They said... Abhirama says he's been trying for months for that room. So C. L. yesterday said that, "Yes, I want to give that. My brothers want that room, and my office wants the room, but I want you to have it." So the meeting was last night, and Abhirama is coming to the <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela.</span> We'll know for sure when he comes. So that might be some good news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good. There our men suffer very much. If that room is available, then it is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They made a... Abhirama made a bathroom. He put four tanks on the top, and there's running water in that bathroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In the one we have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So that's somewhat of an improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Improvement can be done. There is space. Anyway, if we get the down room, it will solve a problem. What is the rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> One thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But C. L. said he would pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is very kind of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We will see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we will be his guest. He will pay rent. That's all right. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So anyway, he said it verbally. We'll see when Abhirama comes. I think he'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, he is. He's offering all his <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> and he's following <span class="Italic">ekādaśī.</span> And he told me yesterday... He showed me a picture of Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa and yourself. And he said he sleeps on his back, and he puts it on his heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So he has your picture in his room, etc. So he appreciates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So... Let's see. What else. I've saved some money by cutting down fences and <span class="Italic">pandal</span> already, and not hiring these cooks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gargamuni said somebody has paid ten thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was supposed to be some man who was going to give five thousand or ten thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> For food relief or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> For something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There's one man who paid for a tent, life member. And Gargamuni Mahārāja gave me ten thousand rupees for food relief yesterday. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then that... I was... He got ten thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He gave it to me yesterday. I have it right here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about Saurabha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He called last night from Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He's there in Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. He just came back yesterday. He'll be coming here soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Now, previously the budget... I figured it out with the ones who are cooking. You wanted <span class="Italic">puris</span> and <span class="Italic">halavā</span> and <span class="Italic">subji,</span> something like that. But we didn't have enough before. So I was going to make <span class="Italic">puṣpanna.</span> Is that all right? Or would you rather... Now, with the ten thousand rupees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puṣpanna</span> for visitors also? No, they will have objection to take <span class="Italic">anna.</span> They'll take <span class="Italic">puri, śāk, halavā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> What do you want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Purī, śāk, halavā</span> is... It can be distributed to anyone. <span class="Italic">Puṣpanna,</span> some may take, some may not take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's some special reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, it is due to our budget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, budget not. The <span class="Italic">puri-śāk</span> is <span class="Italic">pakkā,</span> and <span class="Italic">puṣpanna</span> is <span class="Italic">kacchā.</span> They think like that. That <span class="Italic">kacchā,</span> there is distinction of <span class="Italic">jata.</span> One <span class="Italic">jata,</span> one caste, will not take other caste <span class="Italic">anna.</span> That is Indian thinking. But <span class="Italic">puri-śāk,</span> everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But also everyone was serving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puri-śāk</span> will be cheaper, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Whatever you like. They said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't like, but if you distribute, must be acceptable to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Everyone is serving, that is serving, <span class="Italic">capati</span> and <span class="Italic">dahl.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But everyone is serving that already. That's another reason I thought that <span class="Italic">puṣpanna</span> would be nice because it would be unique.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have no objection. That is all right. But <span class="Italic">puri-śāk</span> is better. Is it costly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> More costly, yes. And I told him to make a list for you to see, if you need it, why it's more costly. At any rate, he says... The cook has done research, our man, and says <span class="Italic">puri-śāk</span> would be more costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But don't allow him to purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Don't you have an Indian purchaser?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is purchasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, he's not an Indian. He's one of our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Our men are purchasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Two of them go together, and they've given me complete receipts. I said, "If you cannot get a receipt, give me a <span class="Italic">kacchā</span> receipt. If you cannot get a <span class="Italic">pakkā,</span> give me <span class="Italic">kacchā</span> receipt written by someone else. So anyway, we'll try and do <span class="Italic">puri-śāk.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puri-śāk,</span> always simple. And if you add with that, some <span class="Italic">puri</span> and some this <span class="Italic">puṣpanna,</span> that can be done. But generally they are taking <span class="Italic">śāk, roti-śāk, dahl.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> The devotees, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And rice also? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Once a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Above all, manage. That's all right, nicely. The foodstuff must be palatable. That should not be rubbish thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No. How are we going to feed others if we are not feeding the devotees nicely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, yesterday we made simple cooking. How it was nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We're making soup at night, simple soup, and devotees like it 'cause it's not hurting their digestion. And I'm having some flat rice on hand for anyone who needs it. So, I'm trying to care for everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is milk supply? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. We have one man from Vṛndāvana who's bringing milk at 2.70 a kilo, a little costly, but <span class="Italic">Mela</span> time, and they have to bring it from a far distance. Anyway, 2.70, kilo, cow's milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cow's milk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cow's milk means buffalo with water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> With a little bit of the newspaper inside also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> For to put, to make it look like cream, they put newspaper also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Make it thick. They grind paper. You have to strain it before you drink it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But I... We tasted it. We came to the conjoint opinion that it was passable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Less newspaper. (laughter) So why such milk should be taken, with newspaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the Muslim countries, the Muslims, they feed the cows fish, dried fish. And the Hindus will not take the local milk there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Because the Muslims are feeding the cows dried fish, and the milk is smelling like fish even. There's no grass for them to eat there in this Arabia, so they're feeding them dried fish, like in a soup. Hindus will not take the milk there even because of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So do you think I should organize this meeting with Chandra Swami also, taking some part in organizing? Or just meet him to get him to see you. Not any special, but I mean to say that he knows the situation. He can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or if he wants to see, he may come. He may find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. He should come to see you. I'm arranging for your car to come from Delhi. We've made two roads of steel, of steel pieces. That's what they're using in the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> on the sand. And I've gotten permission from the head of the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> to take some of that. So we're making two <span class="Italic">rastas,</span> one especially for you, where <span class="Italic">shamiyana</span> comes out, and it doesn't look like a road, but when you come in, just untie that, and your car goes in. And then another one behind. So that will be able to keep any vehicles that come. One bus came already. Haṁsadūta Mahārāja's one bus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, he hasn't. But he sent some men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He is coming, though, I think. That's what we were told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He's expected. I saw Acyutānanda Mahārāja yesterday. He's coming. I don't know if Gargamuni is going to come or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He says his health isn't good. I don't know if he wants to come. I think he just likes to distribute books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What about Gurukṛpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I think they'll all come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Gurukṛpa's in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So there is facility for exchanging dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. I'm trying to cash this draft. I went to three banks, and as I say, I had some traveler's checks, and because there was no money there I cashed my own traveler's checks and left it with them, so they... You want dollars into rupees? Yes, that's possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the rate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It was 8.78 the other day. It fluctuates from day to day, but 8.78.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good rate, 8.70...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Better than before. That was for traveler's checks. It may be slightly less for cash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. Traveler's checks are always higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So I'm going back today. As soon as Gopāla Kṛṣṇa gives me the <span class="Italic">lakṣmī,</span> money, I'll go back. Bhāgavata's doing a very nice job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to go to Orissa, Bhuvaneśvara, afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, I heard you were planning to go. Gargamuni says it's good for the health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, he has about three or four places he was naming that are very good. He's going because his health, he says, isn't good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him go to Bhuvaneśvara. Orissa is good for health?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that's why. Let him come to Bhuvaneśvara, and I want to start a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Your health is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From yesterday it is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> 'Cause you cooked for yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because I could eat little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> What did you cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just rice, dahl, and vegetable. That's all, nothing extraordinary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> And you put lot of spice in it or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So that's the secret. If someone cooks for themselves... Why don't you direct it but not cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I'm directing and nobody learns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I can learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone can see. It is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There's no... Your health must be <span class="Italic">pakkā.</span> So we have separate kitchen for you, separate kitchen for life members. Gargamuni Mahārāja is sending his Shantilal, his cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cooking is being done with wood? That's nice. That is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, very nice. And in the morning, the first morning... When I went there, actually nothing was happening very much. So the first morning... It's so cold, the devotees were just staying in their blankets. So I got up at four o'clock and bathed and started a fire. And I said, "It's warmer here than in your tent. Come around the fire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and around the fire, it is very warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> And it was a trick. And they came around the fire, and then we had <span class="Italic">saṁsāra</span> prayers, and then I said, "Now stay here and chant." So they chanted. Then I gave class. <span class="Italic">Pandal</span> is simple. I have not spent elaborately on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? There is no need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> And we're having display, book table, membership table, and cinema is showing at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how people come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Some people come, but I think once we start our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and leaflets... The <span class="Italic">mela</span> officials said, "We put you there because you will draw, and others will not. People will want to come to you, so they will make an effort to come to you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is easy way to come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's not that difficult. It's just a little distant. Some people were coming. Cars can come also. If they want to come, they can come. It's not far, but it's not so close. I wanted to give you a proper picture. I didn't want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our former camp, last time...? So this is not so good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Location was better. But our living is better this time. Living is better, but location was better last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That location cannot be had. What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Well, first of all, when I came they already settled it up. There's nothing I can do, you know. I said immediately, "This is not such a good location." And Bhāgavata said, "I did not know. I saw it on the map. I had no experience." So I didn't blame him because he didn't know. So they said that "You will draw people, and so we thought we would put others..." I think it is political.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "You draw more people, so you can go out of the way."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Political?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. I think that many people were pushing for good positions, and we did not push, and... Last year was good, but, of course, the <span class="Italic">saṅgam</span> has shifted a little. The <span class="Italic">saṅgam</span> has shifted to the island where we are. The governor's camp is on the island. And there's some people. Maharishi is on the island. It's just I didn't want to say it's a wonderful location and then you come there and see that it's a little bit far off. I wanted to tell you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only it is far off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> And there's another slight defect, which is that it's underneath a railway bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Railway bridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But with all the things that are going on, you can't even hear the trains. Now everyone's starting with... And we have the biggest microphones in the whole <span class="Italic">Mela.</span> Everyone's got microphones this big. And speakers? Speakers? Ours is this big. We've got the biggest ones, six of them, to point in all directions. So that... We thought we would make up for the distance. I thought I would make up by big speakers. We told Kamalapati Tripati that, "Yes, we are living underneath one of your railway bridges," and he laughed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, he's railway member. So railway bridge there is sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, but... When trains come by there is sound. Yes, there is sound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There is electricity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There will be, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Big power points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. There will be two in Prabhupāda's and two on the <span class="Italic">pandal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Electricity, he wanted to know. The thing is there's also sound with bicycles going. Bicycles also go across that bridge. So there's some sound. Not during the high afternoon, because people don't go out. And not during very early morning, but during the day there is. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I think unless I see? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If it's not suitable at the camp, Prabhupāda can go to the house at night and the camp in the day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Even during the day he doesn't have to go except for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Whatever you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Your area is completely enclosed, though, from the rest. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is this? One and a half hour?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> One and a half hours. It is on the edge of Jushi, past, way past the first pontoon bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pontoon bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But they put up some more pontoon bridges also this year. Very far off. Actually, there's not very much near there. He wanted to be far off because they don't do any preaching. And we wanted to be right in the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is their purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Their purpose is feeding a small group of <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> that are in that area who want to be far off. <span class="Italic">Ekadaṇḍi.</span> And they feed... The <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is good, that they give. He was correct. They are giving <span class="Italic">capatis</span> and <span class="Italic">dhal</span> to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eating must be very nice, clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. And respectable. We'll do it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I thought we could save the expenditure. But that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, we wouldn't actually save so much because the time it would take for the devotees to go there to eat <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is three hours, and then the tents are not so good. It would mean a savings of six hundred or eight hundred rupees on tents, and it's completely impractical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And besides that, the Māyāvādīs... Eh? Inconvenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. And they would not appreciate our preaching all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī bhāṣya śunile haya sarva nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">. Sarva nāśa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> If they have a similar verse to that, then they would be very unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I'm saying if they had, "Do not hear personalists' <span class="Italic">bhāṣya,</span>" they would become very unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...that within the Kṛṣṇa's mouth there are millions of <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍas,</span> they think it is simply fictitious. Doctor, <span class="Italic">saheb,</span> you are feeling all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I just ran. I ran a little, so I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, so why don't you sit down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, would you like to have an elephant to ride on one day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I heard, one of these "Prabhupāda saids" from one of the devotees that you said that "If they can ride an elephant, can you get one for me?" Some devotees said that you saw another <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> riding on the elephant, and you asked him, "Can you arrange like that for me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) That was joking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. 'Cause last time, in 1972, you and I were walking, and you saw the <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> on the elephant, and you said, "I would put Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa there." I remember it very well. You said, "I would not sit there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use? (laughter) It goes like this. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Other <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, others are. Processions. It is a procession thing. The <span class="Italic">nagas</span> take them into the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there was no car, elephant had some importance. And now they have got so many cars. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Camels were used as they are now, for ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They still do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They're better than the horses, don't get tired earlier. From Vṛndāvana to Delhi the camels were running. They used (Hindi). I don't know what they call it in Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My Guru Mahārāja purchased two camels. I did not... I do not know what happened, but he purchased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I think Tīrtha Mahārāja was fighting with someone else over them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is long ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have a story in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> that all Ataravart, he can do. The Hastināpura in just when Abhimanyu was going for fight. In those days they were using camels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In Rajastan they use widely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Rajastan is a desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Vṛndāvana quarter there are many camels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everywhere there is camel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They're using camels at the <span class="Italic">Mela.</span> For carrying things they're using camels now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Camels have long legs, you know. They go faster than... Don't get tired as the horses do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In the West they are called "ships of the desert."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have wild camels in Australia even. They used to use them in the desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherever there is desert, there is thorn twig and camels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Both. I think Australian desert is bigger than Indian desert, much bigger, as big as Sahara perhaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Desert means deserted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I went to Makrana, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and I saw they had them hitched for plowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Camels are used for plowing even in Gujarat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And they eat the thorny twigs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't think, sir, there will be camels in Bengal because in Bengal is so many rivers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, there is no camel. And unless there is that thorny twig, they cannot live. That is their food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In Gujarat you find these camels right at the Surat, south of the Gujarat. In north Gujarat they are very common. On the desert. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Darjeeling we were hiring these ho.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> (whispers) Tape always runs out on places like that. (Hari-śauri laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mules, I have seen, if they stop, you can beat like anything; still, it will not move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. "Stubborn as a mule" is a proverb in the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen. The soldiers are beating with the butts of the gun-still (laughter) not going.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the rascals, they do not take it very seriously. They think...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes there's an advertisement in the papers, "You only live once, so buy this." They were selling... It was a land advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals, they invent their theories. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara prāptir,</span> and these rascals says "Once." Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The rascals have also realized now that there is a <span class="Italic">dehāntara-prāptir</span> because the parapsychology has proved beyond doubt so many examples recently, at present, that there is a rebirth. People who are reborn and know their past births. They have recognized their parents, their places and secret things also. There was a patient in Rajastan. One was in Northwest India. There was one in South America. They were all published in medical bulletins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> People accept them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Gradually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medical science do not accept the soul. Then how it is possible, next birth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have to accept. In the teaching of physiology, what we call certain vital forces which we don't understand, they are, this is nothing but God there. What is vital force? What is vital force? It's the soul, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vague idea. Not clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They will become clear later on. Slowly, slowly, the cloud is clearing away from them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when... There is clear idea already. Nothing is going to happen, but because they are less intelligent, therefore next stage is when their intelligence will happen. Things are already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The greatest scientist of the world, Einstein, was a great believer in God, and he was a moral just like a <span class="Italic">ṛṣi</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have seen his picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> His behavior was that of a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Simple. He lived simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not only simply, but he never worried much about things. When he was asked in Christian university how much money he would want paid when first migrated to America, he said, "What is the standard of living here?" (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> But still, the tendency... Kali-yuga means their tendency is away from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is Kali-yuga for all of us, for the good and the bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kali-yuga means <span class="Italic">mandāḥ. Mandāḥ</span>-two meaning. One is "slow"; another meaning is "bad." So <span class="Italic">mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā [SB </span>1.1.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Four times this word used: <span class="Italic">mandāḥ, sumanda-matayo, manda-bhāgyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But one thing about Kali-yuga is that by doing small amount of good work or doing little <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> it has a greater amount of benefit than you would get otherwise in Satya-yuga, Dvāpara or Treta. Is it not, sir? No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good work or bad work, you have to enjoy, good or bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But in Kali-yuga a little <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> will do much good than a good amount of <span class="Italic">tapaḥ</span> in Satya-yuga, thousands or millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is different. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is transcendental. It has nothing to do with this material world. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> And <span class="Italic">karma,</span> if you do good, you'll get good result, and if you do bad, you'll get bad result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But if you are attached to the <span class="Italic">karma</span>... When a person is attached...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, attached or not attached, if you touch fire it will burn. That's all. This is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> If you... Just like child touches fire. It doesn't matter whether he is child or not; fire's business is to burn. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā. Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">karma, śubhā-śubha saba bhaktir baddha. Caitanya-caritāmṛta. Śubha karma</span> or a <span class="Italic">śubha karma,</span> they are all hindrances to spiritual progress. In material world, good and bad, both are the same. <span class="Italic">Dvaite bhadrābhadra sakali samāna. Bhadra</span> and <span class="Italic">abhadra.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jagadīśa has got that letter. So people are enthusiastic there about this <span class="Italic">Mela</span>? People are coming now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many men are found there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> When I was leaving there was about eighty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> But they expect ten million. That's the estimate. Many camps, many <span class="Italic">pandals.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And store, supplies, everything is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Road is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's being improved. In some spots it's nice. But because it's on sand they have to always keep it wet and they put metal plates down. They're trying to do it very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a <span class="Italic">Māghmela</span> committee. One magistrate is the head. A regular committee for managing this <span class="Italic">Mela.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We have contact with this committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is governor's camp from our?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in... They were taking... The committee... I said that, "We have committee?" This is British time. One magistrate is the head and assistants, so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The government officers may not be getting any interest, only the Hindu officials, these British officers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our government, they have to manage so many people. The <span class="Italic">Nagas...</span> I learned it from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Nagas</span> come from Assam, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Arjuna married the <span class="Italic">Naga</span> king's daughter. And he had a son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Babhruvāhana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Babhruvāhana is Manipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ilavan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ilavan, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ilavan was the son of <span class="Italic">Nagas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nagakanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ilavan, Abhimanyu and Babhruvāhana. These were the outstanding sons of Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He was a great fighter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they were <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He did in the war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Babhruvāhana was adopted by his grandfather. That is called <span class="Italic">putrikā, putrikā-putra,</span> "daughter's son adopted as son." So our Dr. Svarūpa Dāmodara belongs to this family, Babhruvāhana family. His title is Singh. That means <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And they are Vaiṣṇavas for the last five thousand years or more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now all the <span class="Italic">Nagas</span> have turned into Christians. Only fifty years back they were headhunters. Fifty years back <span class="Italic">Nagas</span> of Assam were more or less like cannibals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the headhunters means they were killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. They would take revenge by cutting the head of the enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is... Why they are blamed? Everyone is doing that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Africans also do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Their uniqueness is that they display the head on a spear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Any head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And they dance, even as they do in Africa. <span class="Italic">Nagas</span> are very much civilized now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Civilized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In this way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they were civilized. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Western civilization, I mean to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, how Arjuna could marry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Fourth-class civilization. In <span class="Italic">Naga</span> races there is polyandry, sir. One woman can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still there are, in Himalayan hills. One woman has got five husbands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they have got shortage of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the system is there. I think in America also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. America, secret polyandry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, one woman may have more than one husband. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Sometimes. Not legally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is why I said "secret" polyandry. This is official. Some of the Himalayan and Katwa, they... One brother marries and then she becomes the wife of two, three brothers. That is legal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... In here also the system was if one is childless, husband is dead or could not produce, she can take help of the husband's brothers. <span class="Italic">Devareṇa sutotpati:</span> with the help of husband's brother to get child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> But in Kali-yuga that's been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Kalau pañca vivarjayet</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 17.164]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in Māyāpura we see so many pilgrims coming from Assam, Nagaland and Manipur. They're having this Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> and they also worship Caitanya Mahāprabhu. How is that influence also there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu went there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He went to Manipur then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Wasn't it one of the times he was going to Vṛndāvana but didn't go, then He went to Manipur? Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to go and preach in eastern Bengal. And His original paternal house is in Sylhet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is in Assam.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His forefathers from Sylhet. Jagannātha Miśra, His father came from Sylhet to Navadvipa for studying. Then Nilambara Cakravartī got him married with his daughter, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mother. And he resided in Nabadwip.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> There's one temple in Vṛndāvana where they have Deities of Lord Caitanya and Lord Nityānanda that look like Manipur. They made His eyes like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not so good. If you make any picture, then you paint according to the people's, local people's feature. <span class="Italic">Kata catur anana, mani mani yāvat. Vidyāpati.</span> You have heard the name of Vidyāpati? He was a great poet of Darbhanga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Darbhanga, the entrance to Bengal from Bihar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Darbhanga. Door to Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hardwar. "Door to Hari." <span class="Italic">Dwar</span> means gate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Someone invited me last year to Hardwar for the <span class="Italic">Kumbha,</span> and I said, "Why should I go to the door when I live in the house?" I was in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not interested with the door. You are doormen, <span class="Italic">dvar</span>-men. We are inmates. That Vidyāpati has sung, <span class="Italic">kata catur anana, mari mari yāvata. Catur anana</span> means Brahma. They also die. And <span class="Italic">kata</span> means "how many." (pause) So what is the amount of the bank that he transferred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Twenty-five thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I heard, it was thirty-five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There was originally three fixed deposits. One of them was broken six months ago. We used it, BBT. So there was two remaining left for twenty-five. Originally there was thirty-six, and then one was broken. That's already been accounted for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And our Madras center is now closed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. There's no center there now. Mahamsa Swami, he's sending two men there regularly to help set...</div>

By the way, Śrīgarbha came to me and said, "I'm sorry for all your difficulty. I wanted to preach in Poland again." That boy? So he's going to deposit his wife and go to Poland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deposit where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> He wants to do it in Florida.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Florida is nice place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Because he feels she's protected there. I said, "You'll feel that she is protected there, and then you'll have a free mind to preach?" And he said, "Yes, rather than in Europe." So I said, "All right." In your letter you wrote, "Let it go for now." Again you saw the future. "Let it go for now." Then he came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall go down? No.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is walking facility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Water must be extremely cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No. No. In the morning the air is cold, but the water is warm, warmer than the air, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The earlier you take bath, it is warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Once you dip inside. Otherwise it is chilly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's very nice. The tap water also. Either in the river or in the tap, it's warmer. You must come and try it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You bring me water from... (Prabhupāda chuckles) I don't mind coming. Whereas returning it will be difficult for me. You people will be returning after ten, fifteen days. I must come after two, three (indistinct)... Traffic will be so heavy that I may not get even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> No, you can come and go as you like and you can be our guest. Because people are coming but not going, it was easy to go out. Everyone was coming, but no one was going. You can go out easy. We have a nice tent for you, warm water in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Is there sufficient number of trains to the <span class="Italic">Mela?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We're putting extra trains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the <span class="Italic">Mela</span> the train starting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Some going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is some temporary station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. And they're even making a temporary airport from the 14th on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Allahabad has got an airport already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, but it doesn't function regularly. But now they're going to have planes going and coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly there was airport. The place is called Babroli.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You must have seen all these places. You lived there for twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Thirteen or twenty years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirteen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is sufficient long time to know a place. At that time what was the population of Allahabad? About ten <span class="Italic">lakhs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, less than that. Ahmedabad was only four <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> population before. Now it is twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere the population is increased. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> People have more interest because of the industrialization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They attract people. They think they will be happy in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not that. Because they get more easy jobs in the city. You see, jobs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> How can they get jobs easy, when so many people are lying on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is at least they can have some food. In the small villages they're not having.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> In small villages food grows out of the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They don't want to grow. They want to just give up, go to here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> That is an anomaly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I tell you, this vicious propaganda of the government... I have got a small hill, fifteen <span class="Italic">bigas,</span> on a highway, Bombay highway, with canal waters irrigating my land and a well with pump and everything. Last year we spent nine thousand rupees on fertilizer and all things and other paraphernalia, and pay for the servants. And they got paddy worth six thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three thousand lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because the prices was so down, you see, and fertilizer they are selling at a very high rate. Before it was available, a bag, for fifty rupees or fifty-one. Now it is more than eleven-ten. They don't want that a man in the city should be employed for less than five rupees a day. It's very expensive. And they don't work also. They used to work very hard in ancient times. Now they come at ten o'clock, go at five. Before they used to come early morning at six, seven o'clock and work up til five in the evening, and you used to feed them afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Use <span class="Italic">gobar</span> instead of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, <span class="Italic">gobar</span> is not that much available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Gobar</span> means cows. Get a cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We use <span class="Italic">gobar.</span> All of us keep cows. But there is not sufficient for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> You can eat six thousand rupees' worth of rice yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, you can't. You have in the market. No, I cannot eat even this much because I can't bring it here to Bombay. There is a barrier. You can't export from one place to another. This is the government. And our rice is just like the (indistinct) quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go and eat there. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I don't go there to eat it. These government regulations are very bad. I don't think they would be able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's your own right to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He thought that India is spoiled by American policy, Mr. Dulles's. And he spoiled the pitch, this Mr. Nehru, Nehru, being a flamboyant, highly arrogant man... And then they supported Pakistan, and Americans lost lot of money on these small wars. Instead of that, much money was given away to a poor country. it was Dulles who got United States to this present condition. We should have insulated this country after <span class="Italic">svaraj,</span> not selling anything, not taking anything. Produce yourself or starve and die. People don't work when they get food like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am simply surprised when I compare British days and nowadays. My practical experience-one of my maternal uncles, he's a very big, rich man. He was; he is not existing. So he was doing business, rice exporting. So in Calcutta, Chetra side, he had big, big godown full of rice. Not only he, other merchants also. But now they are empty. Similarly, from Bombay the oil seeds are being exported.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. Last year they exported so much of this groundnut. Groundnut oil is costlier than ghee. (talks on for few minutes)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can go? (end)</div>
