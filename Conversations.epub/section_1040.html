<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The king and the daughter went to a great muni's house, a saintly person. Cyavana Muni, Cyavana Muni. And the daughter, young daughter, out of ignorance, she committed some offense. Took one straw and pierced through one insect. The <span class="Italic">muni</span> was sitting there as insect. So the result was-because she offended-all the men of the king, means the soldiers, the secretaries, they stopped passing urine and stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The <span class="Italic">muni</span> was there in the form of an insect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And she pierced him. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the result was all of them became without passing stool. So the king could understand there is some offense. So... Because formerly the kings were saintly persons. He asked all his men, "What you have done?" Then the girl said, "Father, I have done something." Then he made this plea that, "Kindly excuse this girl... Out of ignorance..." He was very angry, that Cyavana Muni. His attitude was always angry. Then all of them became very much aggrieved. Then he asked, "Whether your girl is married?" King could understand that "He wants to marry my daughter. Otherwise, why he's inquiring." And he was so old... I have got my skin still tight. All loose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was all slack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he was old. So he had to agree. Otherwise, the whole thing was catastrophe. So the king said, "Yes. She's not married. If you like I can offer my daughter to you." Then everything was settled up. But the daughter was young, and he was like her grand, great-grandfather. Match was not at all suitable, but he had to offer. So this girl also took it seriously, and she was serving the old husband very faithfully like honest, chaste wife. Never mind. Then, some days after, the same saintly person was visited by two heavenly physicians, <span class="Italic">aśvinī-kumāras.</span> The <span class="Italic">aśvinī-kumāras,</span> they had some difficulty. They were not allowed in the society of the demigods while drinking <span class="Italic">soma-rasa.</span> They had some defects, something like that. So when the physician came to see Cyavana Muni he said that "If you can give me young age, beautiful, you can make me by your treatment beautiful young man, which is very pleasing to young girls, then I shall give you the facility of drinking <span class="Italic">soma-rasa</span> in the society of demigods." "Yes." So he made him very nice beautiful-looking young man by taking him to a certain lake, and they dipped down and all of them became fresh young men, beautiful, very beautiful. So his chaste wife, she could not recognize, "Who is my husband?" They look all very beautiful young men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Cyavana and his followers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Cyavana became young and the <span class="Italic">aśvinī-kumāras</span> also became...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, they all went in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They dipped down in a certain lake. In this way, he became a very beautiful young man. Then for <span class="Italic">soma-yajña,</span> his father-in-law, the daughter's father came. He came. So he was surprised, "How is that? My daughter is with another young man?" He became angry. "My dear daughter, what is this? You are defaming your husband's family and my family." He began to chastise like that. And just see. Because he sees that "I got my daughter married with old Cyavana. How is that, with a young man?" Just see. Condemned like anything. And she was laughing. She knew that "I have not changed my husband. A change of body." Then she said, "My dear father, don't be angry. He's your real son-in-law. He has become now young by treatment." Then he was very pleased and embraced his daughter, that "You are so nice." This is Vedic civilization. Even one has got old, going to die husband, she cannot change. This is the chastity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Once a woman was married, then that was finished. No connection with another man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That one marriage is sufficient. She must remain very faithful to her husband, chaste. That is wanted. Not that "I do not like this husband. I'll change." That is not wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's Western mentality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever your father and mother has chosen, that's all. He's your worshipable husband. This is the... This point I wanted to bring. And her father was surprised. "How is that? I got you married with an old man? Somehow or other, circumstances I was obliged. How is that you have picked up one young man?" He chastised her like anything. Then when he came to understand that the same old man has become now young man by medical treatment, then he was satisfied. So you cannot change. I have seen it. One, my father's friend, he was very old man. My father was also... He was at that time not less than sixty-five. But his wife died, and he was married with another young girl. But his sister forced him to marry. That "Unless you marry, who will look after you? You have no children." But I have seen that young woman who was married with that gentleman... In our childhood we used to called her <span class="Italic">didi</span>. <span class="Italic">Didi</span> means elder sister. So the relationship was very thick and thin. But that old man, not less than sixty-five, and this young woman, utmost twenty to twenty-five. She was serving the husband like anything. We have seen it. There is no question of changing or being dissatisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now they bring them up to be independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a question of culture. Culture. She was king's daughter, royal, and married her with a <span class="Italic">muni,</span> old, rotten. Older than me. All the skin has become slackened. But still she was serving him just like worshipable lord. The age difference is great-grandfather and great-granddaughter. You'll find in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> Lord Śiva, he could not construct even a house. He was living underneath a tree. And his wife, Durgā, <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> She can create a new world, so powerful, Durgā. She's living with her husband underneath a tree. Never claims, "My dear husband, if you cannot, I can make one." There is a story about that. That, "People criticize us. All right, let us have some house." So Lord Śiva, Durgā, both of them capable to do anything. So they constructed a very nice gold house. "Now we shall live." So there is new house entering ceremony. So one Gargamuni was invited as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Many other <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So they began to eat so much... That story I'm now forgetting. Then whatever stock they have finished, when, after eating, when they wanted, "Give us <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā.</span>" Because after eating there is... So Lord Śiva, where shall I get everything? I have finished." Then they became puzzled what to do. So Lord Śiva said, "All right, you take this house." Again they became underneath a tree. (laughs) "All right, as <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā </span>you take this house. Don't bother." Their house entrance ceremony was there. As a result of that ceremony they became again underneath a tree. (About someone else:) What they're doing? (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ... because as soon as the ship stopped, Commonwealth Pier, Boston, the immigration department came and took their papers. So I entered America in Boston. There was no checking in New York. The ship stopped in Boston. The official entrance was done there. Then when I came to New York, it is just like one day's travel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And then you went directly to Pennsylvania? By bus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Then one agent, appointed by my host, Gopal Agarwal. He was in Butler. So he arranged with some professional what is called, host.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Travel agent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe travel agent. He came to see me, that "I am sent by Gopal Agarwal, so I'll arrange for your dispatch. You come with me."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was all by chance. I was for a few days guest at his father's place in Agra. I did not know that his son is in America. So he was talking about his family. He was little sorry that his eldest son went to America to study electric engineering, and he was entrapped by an English girl, and he married and settled there and did not come back. In this way... So I took the opportunity, that "Why don't you ask your son to sponsor me?" I wanted to go to America. So I did not know how seriously he took it. But I simply told him that "Why don't you ask your son to sponsor me at least for one month. So I am thinking of going to America." Then that was talking, beginning and end, that's all. I did not know that he took it very seriously. Then after two, three months, some documents came. I was receiving my letters in a post box. So when I left Delhi I used to keep my key of post box with some nice bookseller, Atmaram, he was manager. So he opened that, he got that documents. That is No Objection Certificate, Sponsor, and everything. I was out of Delhi. Then when I came back I took it. So everything was there, that sheet (indistinct) from the Indian Consulate, No Objection Certificate. Then I applied for a passport. In this way I had to go. So Gopal was unknown to me, but his father was, his father was known to me. His father was... Then his agent got me on the bus. So on the bus (I) went to Pennsylvania.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's a long drive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, nine hours on the bus. And I took a little chipped rice, and whatever I had with me. So I got down from the ship about one o'clock. Then I had to wait for the bus till five o'clock. Then at five o'clock the bus started. About two o'clock, three o'clock in the morning, I went to Pennsylvania, and just in front of the bus Gopal was standing with his car, that... What is called? Van Car ?</div>

Then at night he took my (indistinct). The next day, he had no many rooms in his apartment, he arranged for my stay in the YMCA nearby them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You never actually stayed with him then.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife, Sally. His wife, Sally she was arranging. A very intelligent girl. They were of the same age, about thirty. Gopal was more than thirty and she was (indistinct). I saw that she was feeding her child, one boy, meat powder.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do know what is the name. But I asked. she said, "It is meat powder." That is the system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When they're very young and they can't eat solids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With hot water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, they have instant meals for children. All different kinds of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Gopal was very much pleased that he could get some Indian <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis,</span> like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So he had you cook for him. You took your cooker with you? Is that the same one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So I lived with him for twenty-one days. Then I came to New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that picture in the <span class="Italic">Butler Eagle.</span> It's in the <span class="Italic">Vyāsa-Pūjā</span> book this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Butler County, it is good (indistinct), there were many churches (indistinct) people have got so many churches (indistinct) [break] ...some time, that one piece of wire lying in one place, one piece of bamboo was lying in another place, and one dry shell of a squash was lying. So one intelligent man collected. So this dry shell became the tamburā's what is called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know. Like sound chamber. What do you call it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sound chamber may be called. So with that dry squash he made the sound chamber. The bamboo he fixed up and the wire upon it and then it became a "Tin, tin, tin, tin..." (laughs) Our organization is like that. I was loitering in the street. Somebody was over there, somebody was there. Not combined together, International Society String Band. Yes. Separately we are all useless. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, we were useless. You were never useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, your assistance was required. How you can be useless? We're all useless. But combined together, now we have become a stringed instrument. This is very good example. Separately... Just like the same logic, <span class="Italic">andha-khañja.</span> Separately, <span class="Italic">andha</span> is useless, and <span class="Italic">khañja</span> is useless. Blind and lame. They cannot do anything. But combined together, they become useful. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Would you like to reply? Or it's just recorded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall reply. You find them if they are coming. (end)</div>
