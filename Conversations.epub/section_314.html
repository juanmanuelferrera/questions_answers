<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it has emanated from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yato vā imāni bhūtāni jāyante.</span> This is the statement of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and... So how would you explain that a person can produce such huge quantity of material things, at least to make them understand how it is produced from the person? These are to be scientifically explained, wherefrom so much vast mass of water came. That you have to explain scientifically. Otherwise how they will accept? Simply by saying, It has come from Kṛṣṇa," they will not accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) Indian man:</span> Yes. We have to convince them about the method of approach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If these boys, in their scientific language, they try to convince, that will be more effective. We are generally speaking that "Water has come from Kṛṣṇa," or "The earth has come from Kṛṣṇa." That may be blind. But if it is scientifically presented, how it has come from Kṛṣṇa, then they cannot refute so easily. So that I am engaging this doctor of chemistry, Svarūpa Dāmodara and Rāya Rāmānanda. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's two personal associates, Svarūpa Dāmodara and Rāmānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, and Rāya Rāmānanda. Very, very strange coincidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas śrutasya vā...</span> You find out this verse. You have to find out the... No, no, from here. You have to take the index. Where is Paṇḍita? Paṇḍita is not here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Pradyumnajī. Pradyumna. You call him <span class="Italic">paṇḍita?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Rightly so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is American <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> Paṇḍitjī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He is out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he's out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span>. He came to me today, asked for a copy of <span class="Italic">Harināmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa,</span> which we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You find out the verse: <span class="Italic">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is required. If you are a great scientist, you just glorify the qualities of <span class="Italic">Uttama-śloka.</span> Then it is perfect. Simply you remain a scientist among some people, but you cannot describe about Kṛṣṇa, then your scientific knowledge... <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">. Tapasaḥ śrutasya vā sūktasya sviṣṭasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ. Nāmāny anantasya yaśo 'ṅki... </span>What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have to attend a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-paṭha,</span> at 3.30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Rādhā-Dāmodara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> So who is reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Nṛsiṁhānanda Goswami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> This verse is very important verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā. Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> That volume is packed, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. <span class="Italic">Nāmāny anantasya yaśo 'ṅkitāni yad avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpitaḥ. Nirūpita</span> means it is already decided. The perfection of your education is this. What is that? <span class="Italic">Nāmāny anantasya. Anantasya. Yaśaḥ aṅkitāni. Yaśaḥ.</span> That is perfection. If you scientific knowledge, philosophical knowledge; cannot establish the glories of the Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then they are useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. <span class="Italic">Avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpitaḥ.</span> It is already taken. <span class="Italic">Nirūpita</span> means there is no argument. It is already concluded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Your business is not to prove or disprove, but to glorify Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By your knowledge. If you are scientist, you are chemist, through chemical challenge you try to glorify the Supreme Lord. If you are physicist, from physical point of view, try to explain. If you are scientist... Anyway, because ultimate... <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Any knowledge, that is... You have to approve the Supreme. That is real perfect knowledge. And at the present moment men of knowledge they are rejecting. Because they cannot explain, they are rejecting. They do not bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Modern science has cleared the deck very much for religion. They are not so dogmatic as the old scientists used to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they say now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, you see, the modern scientific discoveries have led to the stage at which the science can no more say that religion is humbug. Now they say, "Well, we do not know. Honestly speaking, that is the position," they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. "We do not know. We know thus far and not beyond." So that's a great achievement. That's a great achievement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. At least, they should not teach because they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, the topmost scientists are much saner now. They don't make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But the best thing will be, they may not talk all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They don't talk nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they admit they do not know, why do they speak so much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One scientist has said about matter. He says, "Matter is I know not what." This is his definition of matter. "Matter is I know not what." So no more dogmatism. No more dogmatism.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can distribute some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā<br class="calibre2"/>sviṣṭasya sūktasya ca buddhi-dattayoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpito<br class="calibre2"/>yad-uttamaśloka-guṇānuvarṇanam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.5.22]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I suppose you will come now when this thing is constructed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We shall try to construct it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Let us expedite this so that Prabhupāda may come again very soon. (Hindi conversation) (end)</div>
