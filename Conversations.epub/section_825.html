<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Morning walk, April 7, 1976, Vṛndāvana, Raṅga Gardens. (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...dozen carts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It looks like it came from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...cannot say, Hare Kṛṣṇa. There is such competition. (Hindi with others) I like this garden very nice. (Hindi) It is maintained very nicely. We can get flowers. (Hindi) Water is supply there? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> There are two wells. (Hindi) The river is very near. Just after that garden, Yamunā. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These people, they like Vṛndāvana. (Hindi) What is our telephone number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> 179.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> 8.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vṛndāvana 178.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> 178. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are not tres.... (Hindi) Whatever you think, as you like, we can ex.... [break] (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> I can remember from <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> one devotee of Lord Rāmacandra was always chanting the name of Rāma, but Lord Caitanya convinced him to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) There is competition like that. One will say "Hare Rāma." Another will say "No, Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was very obstinate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Or that man in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That man in Delhi thought we had something against Lord Rāmacandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many versions like that. Somebody will say, "Your Rāmacandra may be very important person, but when Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa, Lord Rāmacandra becomes His (Her) guard with arrows..." (laughter) When Rādhārāṇī goes to Kṛṣṇa, and Rāmacandra has to serve Rādhārāṇī with arrows and bows. (pause) This is <span class="Italic">gorur.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that six-pointed star significance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cakra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What is the symbol on the right-hand side, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think <span class="Italic">śaṅkha.</span> That is the conchshell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] ...thread from the Deity, the old sacred thread, and they tie it on their wrist. They tie it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Some of the devotees have started to do that now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know. It's just like wearing beads. The sacred thread from the Deity, after replacing, they take the old one and they wear it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has told them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Well, I told one boy to stop it, and because I couldn't quote any authority, he keeps wearing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there is no author.... Where is his authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This nonsense should be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I thought it was wrong. That's why I mentioned it. I wanted to make sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Okay. Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think their idea is that because it's <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> it's from the Deity, that they're able to wear it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another concoction. The sacred thread is not used like that, in the hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I thought it was wrong. It seems like some kind of fashion or something, concocted fashion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] ...small black beads that the devotees are wearing from Rādhā-kuṇḍa. They have a string of beads made of clay from Rādhā-kuṇḍa. Are they...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhā-kuṇḍa clay is not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So it's all right to wear them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very constantly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes I think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you're worried that one thing will lead to the next. Actually all we have to do is follow your example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, we don't have to add anything. What can we add?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the use of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> What can we add?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a proverb in Bengali that the crows, they eat stool. But when the crow is very young, he eats more stool. [break] ...tendency always, how to become hippie, as soon as there is little opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, it's something we have to guard against very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't allow them. Don't allow all these.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Even in India people say like that, "Oh, you are hippies?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you become hippie, immediately your all prestige will go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Finished, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is, a lot of the devotees, they're not very much conscious that they're being watched by the, very carefully by the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bird of paradise? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, the bird of paradise is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different. (end)</div>
