<div class="Purp-para"></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...but in different ways. <span class="Italic">Mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha... Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> So proportionately they realize the Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa in a different way. But He advises that "Why don't you take the direct way?" Therefore he says at the last chapter, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Directly become Kṛṣṇa conscious."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> That doesn't need any <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> then. Just take His <span class="Italic">śaraṇa</span> and everything will be okay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That <span class="Italic">śaraṇa</span> means... That includes... That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Even a <span class="Italic">tulasī dala</span> and a little water is not necessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No necessary, necessary, necessary because <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> That is the path of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It is also confirmed, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is in the mind, in the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not in the mind. No, no. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is in the heart, but there must be... Just like if you have got love for me in the heart, it must be demonstrated. Just like a husband and wife. The wife is says, "Now we are married and I have got love for you. Let me remain here. You go to your home." The bridegroom comes, "Now we are married and I love you, you love me. You go home, I remain here." Is that very good proposal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, but this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is nonsense. (laughing) "I have got <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> but I don't do anything for You. You go home." So that is not <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> must be exhibited by activity. That is the definition of <span class="Italic">bhakti. Śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> So these are the nine different ways of expressing <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> First thing is <span class="Italic">śravaṇam. Śravaṇam. Śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ,</span> chanting and hearing. Of whom? Of Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.</span> Not of any other one. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they say that "We can chant anyone's name, either I chant of any demigod's name or any name."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But does He not say that "Whatever or whoever does it, it comes to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam.</span> That is said, <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam,</span> "Not in order."</div>
<div class="Verse">ye 'py anya-devatā-bhaktā<br class="calibre2"/>yajanti śraddhānvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi mām eva kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">That is not <span class="Italic">vidhi. Vidhi</span> is here. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam.</span> The first word is Viṣṇu, of Viṣṇu, not of any other. So these are the demonstration of <span class="Italic">bhakti. Śravaṇam kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">arcanā.</span> Just like we perform in the morning, in the evening, at noon, <span class="Italic">arcā-vigraha.</span> Viṣṇu, <span class="Italic">arcayam,</span> Viṣṇu. It is not idol worship. <span class="Italic">Arcayaṁ viṣṇu-śilā-dhiḥ.</span> If one thinks the <span class="Italic">arcā-mūrti,</span> the worshipable Deity in the temple, as stone or as wood, <span class="Italic">arcayaṁ viṣṇu-śilā-dhiḥ guruṣu nara-matiḥ...</span> To accept guru, in the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system... All the gurus in the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system... <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Nara-matiḥ,</span> consider him as ordinary human being... In this way there is a list. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> A Vaiṣṇava, a devotee: "He is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> Vaiṣṇava. He is American Vaiṣṇava. He is <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> Vaiṣṇava." No. When one is Vaiṣṇava, there should be no distinction by the caste. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇave jāti-buddhiḥ.</span> In this way there is a list that should be avoided. So these things required. If actually... The same thing, that if a girl is married to the husband, she must be always engaged in the service of the husband. That will be appreciated. If she says, "Sir, now we are married. You go home and I remain at home," there will be no <span class="Italic">prayojana-siddhi.</span> The real purpose of marriage is to get children. <span class="Italic">Putrārthe kriyate bhāryā.</span> So if the husband and wife simply love within the mind and there is no action, there is no <span class="Italic">prayojana-siddhi.</span> We should be practical, not simply theoretical. So love between two persons, there must be exchange of loving feelings. These are the exchange of loving feelings. Unless the exchange loving feelings are there, that is not love. That is theoretical. That is not practical. It is... I have explained in the beginning of <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> that love is practical exhibition. It is not theoretical. We cannot keep love within the heart. If actually it is within the heart, it must be expressed practically, and these are the... If I love you, then as soon as there is some news, "Oh, Dr. Ghosh is coming?" I shall be very much interested to hear about you, when you are coming, how you are coming. That is love. So that is <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ.</span> If one has love for God, he must hear about God. That is purpose, <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ.</span> And if he has heard about God, then he must chant also. He should, I mean to say, preach to others, "Oh, God is like this, God is like that, God is so beautiful, He does like this, He does like that." That is <span class="Italic">kīrtana. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ. Smaraṇam. Smaraṇam</span> means always remembering. Without <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ...</span> Just like this chanting. When I say Hare Kṛṣṇa, immediately I remember Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's form, Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, Kṛṣṇa's, everything of Kṛṣṇa, automatically, His quality, His beauty. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ padā-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> To be engaged in the service of the lotus feet as Lakṣmīji is being engaged in the service of the Lord, <span class="Italic">anantam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Why do we prefer <span class="Italic">pāda</span> and not the head or the hands? What is the rationale?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is impudency. That is impudency. The worship of the Deity should begin from the leg, from the feet. That is respect. Just like my disciples offer respect and touches my feet, not my head. That is impudency. You cannot touch head. Head is touched when I give him, "All right, be blessed." I shall touch his head, and he shall touch my feet. This is the process. You cannot touch the superior head. That is impudency. You cannot jump over like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It's a part of the body. It is only a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But that is the system. That is the system. You should begin. That... That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> The First and Second Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> are the two legs of Kṛṣṇa. That is the beginning. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> These professional reciters, they read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> They jump over immediately to the face. The Tenth Canto is described as the face of Kṛṣṇa. So you cannot go immediately to the head. You must begin from the feet. First Canto, Second Canto. Therefore there are nine cantos, and then Tenth Canto. And the Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rasa</span> dance, that is the smiling of Kṛṣṇa. So you cannot ask the superior to take the facility of his smiling. Smiling will be when he is pleased. The difficulty is that the Māyāvādī philosophy, they do not accept the form of the Lord. And they do not know how to behave with the form. Of course, there is no difference between Kṛṣṇa's face and Kṛṣṇa's feet. There is no difference. But still, the system must be followed. <span class="Italic">Pāda-sevanam.</span> It is very important verse. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one has heard, when one has properly chanted, he has little experience of the transcendental form of the Lord, then his service beginning. Just like I engage one servant. So gradually he is given service. "First of all this, first of all that, then..." Again and again, again, again. The same example can be given, that the husband and wife. Formerly, when I was married, my wife was eleven years old. So (laughing) an eleven years old girl and I was at the same time twenty-one, twenty-two. One day I captured her hand. She began to cry. A little girl, you see? So gradually, gradually. I know... When my brother-in-law, sister's husband, used to come... In the beginning, the girls were very... My sisters were same age. So they would meet the husband, offering a little pan or little <span class="Italic">sandeśa.</span> [break] ...after this. Then <span class="Italic">niṣṭhā.</span> Then he has got a firm conviction that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and my duty is to serve Kṛṣṇa." That is called <span class="Italic">niṣṭhā.</span> Then <span class="Italic">ruci.</span> Then he increases taste. He cannot go out. He cannot go out of this jurisdiction. Just like these boys, they have come from Europe, America. They are attached. Otherwise I am not giving them bribe. I have no money. Why they are attached to serve me any way? If I say that "You die," he will die. Why this attachment? This is development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, development of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Ruci, aśakti, tato bhāva.</span> Then <span class="Italic">bhāva. Bhāva</span> means Kṛṣṇa consciousness fully developed. Then love. Then love. Love is actually exhibited. Then "Let me serve Kṛṣṇa in this way, in that way, that way, that way." You see? Fully engaged. This is the process. You cannot say that "Let my love be stagnant in my heart. There is no exhibition." No. There must be exhibition. That is the symptom of love. Otherwise why Rūpa Gosvāmī resigned from his ministership? He was a devotee from the very beginning. He is <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha,</span> eternal devotee. But he gave up everything. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍali-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī. About Rūpa Gosvāmī and all the Gosvāmīs, this is described that <span class="Italic">tyaktvā tūrṇam aśesa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ.</span> They were ministers. Their associates were big, big personalities, <span class="Italic">maṇḍala-pati.</span> Big, big leaders. <span class="Italic">Maṇḍala-pati</span> means big, big leaders. Just like in Indian villages, still there is one man, chief man, he is called <span class="Italic">maṇḍala.</span> Or there are many <span class="Italic">maṇḍalas,</span> and there is one head, <span class="Italic">maṇḍala-pati.</span> So <span class="Italic">tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ.</span> He was meeting with big, big <span class="Italic">zamindars,</span> big, big leaders, big, big... Because he was minister. So he gave up all this association. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala.</span> Not one, two, but many, he gave up. "What is the value of this association? What is the value? They are not Kṛṣṇa conscious." So gave up. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat.</span> "What is the value of these things?" <span class="Italic">Tuccha-vat. Bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau.</span> Just to show favor to the mass of people he became a mendicant. <span class="Italic">Dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā.</span> Just like Gandhi also did that. Although he was the greatest leader, he was living like a mendicant, one loincloth. That's all. <span class="Italic">Maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna-kanthāśritau.</span> Then how he managed? Just like we have seen practically in the life of C.R. Das. He was living very luxuriously. You know, C.R. Das.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And he was earning fifty-thousand rupees at that time, fifty years ago. What is the value, just see. He was earning and spending like anything, lavishly, and he was so bad associated that wine and woman was his paraphernalia. That's all. As soon as there will be case engaged the first order is that "You have to supply so many cases of wine and so many batches of prostitute." That was C.R. Dasa's condition, first condition. In the Mopaceel(?) court when he would be invited to plead, the first condition is this. Then his fees. So in this way he was living. But he gave up. On Congress Movement he gave up everything practiced, but he died within one year. Because he was living so luxuriously, all of a sudden he became a renouncer, he could not tolerate that. He died. Within one year he died. So therefore these ministers, they gave up all this luxurious life, became a mendicant. The question is how they lived? <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā tūrṇam aśeṣa-maṇḍala-pati-śreṇīṁ sadā tuccha-vat bhūtvā dīna-gaṇeśakau karuṇayā kaupīna kan...</span> Then <span class="Italic">gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtādhi-laharī-kallola-magnau sadā:</span> They were fully absorbed in the thought of how Kṛṣṇa, and His pastimes with His <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> He was always absorbed. <span class="Italic">Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.</span> This is exhibition. When one becomes ecstatic, "Oh, now I have to do something for Kṛṣṇa," then he renounces everything. Only Kṛṣṇa. Only Kṛṣṇa's business. That is the test. That is the test. What is the use of spiritual advancement? Spiritual advancement means these material things given up. That is spiritual advancement. That is... The example is given, <span class="Italic">bhaktiḥ pareṣānubhavoḥ viraktir anyatra syāt.</span> As soon as one develops real <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> he will be averse to all these material things. That is the first sign. "No more these things." <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareṣānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like if you are hungry and if you are given some food, if you are satisfied, then the same food will be denied by you. "No, no, no. I don't want anymore." Full satisfaction. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja said, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42].</span> When he fully became perfect and Nārāyaṇa was present before him, He asked him, "What benediction you want? You take." He said, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi:</span> "Simply by seeing You, by Your presence, I am fully satisfied. No more benediction. I don't want any benediction." This is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhaktiḥ pareṣānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...ca lābha-santuṣṭau.</span> No more demand. "Whatever by Kṛṣṇa's grace comes, that's all right. And not comes, it doesn't matter." The other <span class="Italic">śloka</span> also, <span class="Italic">nirāśī,</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise how one can be satisfied in any condition of life unless there is <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span> That is the test. The test is that he has got something. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> If he actually achieves Kṛṣṇa, then he does not think that anything better than this. That I see amongst these Europeans and American boys and girls. They have seen it, that "It is better than our so-called material life." Therefore they have been able to give up. Just like this boy Girirāja, he is very rich man's son. His father gave him a special car. His father is a big lawyer in Chicago. So he gave up everything. Now he is begging daily, although he is earning at least fifty-thousand rupees per month. But he has no... He is just like beggar. He doesn't care for his father. There are many like this. <span class="Italic">Bhaktiḥ pareṣānubhavo viraktir anyatra syāt [SB </span>11.2.42]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the test. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi) [break] ...devotee. Then all the good qualities will be manifested in his person. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ mano-rathena asato dhavato bahiḥ.</span> And if one is not a perfect devotee of Kṛṣṇa, of Hari, then he cannot possess any <span class="Italic">mahad-guṇa. Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> Why? <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena:</span> "He is simply hovering in the mental plane." He is not fixed up. Therefore <span class="Italic">asato dhavato bahiḥ.</span> Then he will have to do something which is <span class="Italic">asat. Asato maṁ sad gama.</span> That is the Vedic... "Don't remain in the <span class="Italic">asat;</span> just make progress to the <span class="Italic">sat.</span>" That is wanted. That cannot be done unless one is fully situated in unalloyed devotional service of the Lord. That is not possible. One must go to the <span class="Italic">asat,</span> because he is hovering on the mental plane. Mental plane is not secure. Anyone who is in mental plane, he may fall down at any moment. So we have to transcend the mental plane. Intellectual plane. <span class="Italic">Jñana-karmady-anavṛtam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam<br class="calibre2"/>ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-<br class="calibre2"/>śīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> simply to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, fully engaged. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena,</span> favorable, as Kṛṣṇa wanted Arjuna, "You fight!" So he did not like to fight. He was non-violent, so-called. But Kṛṣṇa wants. Kṛṣṇa wants, <span class="Italic">ānukūlyena.</span> Kṛṣṇa must be satisfied. It doesn't matter whether I am satisfied or not. But here things are going that "Kṛṣṇa, we don't care. If Your instruction does not appeal to me, to my sense satisfaction, I don't like it." This is going on. Nobody likes to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Nobody is prepared to that. "If Kṛṣṇa satisfies my whims, then I accept Kṛṣṇa." This is going on. That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti. Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānu-śīlanaṁ</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply you have to abide by the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> [break] ...in devotional service. Without devotional service, all activities, they are false, simply just like jumping like the monkey. What is the value? The monkey is always busy, but his business has no value. His business has no value. Therefore as soon as one monkey..., "Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out!" But he is always busy. So to become busy like a monkey has no value. To busy, to become busy as a devotee, that has value. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The Māyāvādī philosophy is that "This business is useless, so stop it altogether." No. That is negation. If you stop... Just like a child, if you stop playing mischief, always doing, then he will be mad, psychologically. You must give him some engagement, better engagement, so that he will not commit any more mischief. So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is a service, activity. If he is not engaged in activity, then he will become again a rascal. Because we are living entities. We are not dead stone. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam, hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Engage, <span class="Italic">hṛṣīka</span> means the senses. The senses must be engaged. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ.</span> Now the senses are engaged for my sense gratification. So it should be purified, no more sense gratification. But the senses must have engagement. And how? That is in the service of the Lord. That is real activity. So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not that it is simply negation. There must be positive action. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> ...exist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Certainly. Certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Have you seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you have not seen so many things. Does it mean that does not exist? You are researching. You have not seen. As a scientist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> I have heard lots of ghost stories, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is not stories. We are hearing from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> It is authority. We are not hearing the stories of a third-class man. We are hearing from Vyāsadeva. Vyāsadeva...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But you see, up till now, in my long life of eighty years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you have not so many experiences. That does not mean these things does not exist. Your experience is not all in all. Don't think like that. So these are existing actually. That is the defect, that you do not accept the authorities. That is the defect. Here Vyāsadeva is describing, who is called Vedavyāsa, full of all knowledge, and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is a mature experience. We are hearing from him. Why you should not believe? I may not have experience. This ghost means the living entity is subtle life without any material body. That is ghost. When one is very sinful, he does not get the material body. He lives in the subtle body: mind, intelligence and ego. That is ghostly life. And they display. Because they have no body, one cannot see, but they display so many mischiefs. That is ghostly life. [break] Seeing or not seeing doesn't matter. Therefore it is enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, śāstra cakṣuṣā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But it should be proved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is true because it is spoken by Vyāsadeva. How you say it is false? You cannot say that. That is blasphemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> In olden days there used to be the ghosts and all these things, but now that is gradually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But gradually... That does not mean you have improved very much. Because you do not believe in the ghost...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Our mental condition has improved.</div>

He is saying, you have to accept. "I have seen. I have no experience," that doesn't matter. So many things you do not know. Just like a child has no experience what is the other side of the sea. Does it mean that there is nothing? A child may say like that, but a person who has visited the Arabian countries and others, "Oh no, no, no. There are so many things." So experience should be taken from a person who has got real experience. Not that "Because I cannot see, it is void." That is not experience.</div>
