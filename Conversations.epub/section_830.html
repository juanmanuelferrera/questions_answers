<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have already constructed for our residential quarters. That is already there, very big. Such a big building is not there in that district.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, Prabhupāda is doing everything. We are simply like puppets. He tells us what to do. Transcendental management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Just in Bombay, what you are constructing, the gate, are they going to be like another Indian temples, only gates? Will they look like a big temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean those.... (Hindi) In south we have got those temples, gates. That is only common in southern India but not anywhere else. <span class="Italic">Gopurams</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gopurams</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gopurams</span> are not found anywhere else.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, original, south. Here in Vṛndāvana also there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That was the temple where this, I mean, Rāmānujācārya, they would.... That is Śrī Raṅgapuram. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not at all. It is a business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> People give them money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that money is utilized for business. They are so businessman that people go and sacrifice their hair, and they are selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That I know. They are selling hair to foreign countries. Selling hair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they are investing money for so many business, not for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, they're establishing colleges and Sanskrit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But college.... College is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sanskrit <span class="Italic">Vidyālaya</span> and Vedic institutions. They have one or two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (3):</span> (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We met station platform, means...(?) That is another thing(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Otherwise for common people, it is very difficult</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> One man was waiting in a queue for four hours. Did not see. And he came back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is a fee. There is a fee for going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In some places, even if you have money, you cannot see, like Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are fools, sir. You can go. I think one day I will have to go with them and fight out the whole case. These boys should be allowed. They follow the <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> And again in.... I mean, now the government has put the regulations that all the temples are open to all, anybody and everybody. How can they refuse? Who are at that <span class="Italic">maṭha,</span> Jagannātha? Those people, they must be from Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Local men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All the big temples in India have got management committees, practically people from various parts. Our own Jagannātha Purī, I mean, this, our Dvārakā temple is managed by people from Bombay. Bombay, Delhi, and many other places. So they must have all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even one of our Indian men they stopped. Caitya-guru told me that when he went there they thought he was Westerner. They wouldn't let him in the second time he tried to go in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This gentleman is coming before the judge of the Bombay high-court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> We can see the <span class="Italic">cakra</span> on the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> We can see the <span class="Italic">cakra</span> on the top. It is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> [break] No, no, no, don't. It should have been taken out, not here but there. That was not for, but that was the government of India wanted to construct an office for customs here, and we objected, that "You can't do it in the sea area where we have to..., on the beach." So they broke it down. You know that small.... It will not be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can continue. It can continue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They come down there and just stay for pleasure. Because this temple.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be an institution for teaching spiritual life. So if he does not take the teaching, then it is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One thing, you must have a Sanskrit school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can have. Sanskrit is already there in the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then let them have a factual teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now every gentleman knows English, so we have explained everything in English. There is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right, sir. But when you see, I mean, study a thing in English and study original language, you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original language? Nobody can read Sanskrit nowadays. Even the Sanskrit <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> they also cannot read. I have tried it. [break] It does not depend on understanding language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hearing. One who has heard, given oral reception nicely, he is perfect knowledge. Therefore our <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are known as <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> You have to learn it by hearing, not by studying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> also, <span class="Italic">śravaṇam</span> is first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">. Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.</span> Anyone who is not taking seriously to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he is purposefully committing suicide. It is not a sentiment; it is a scientific movement. But they do not care to understand. Therefore, purposefully they are committing suicide. <span class="Italic">Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu,</span> very appropriate word: "I have drunk poison knowingly." We shall return now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Hari hari bifale, janama goṅāinu. Jaya.</span> "I am free. What can I...? Whatever I like, I can do," without knowing, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27].</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra</span> there will be, but <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā,</span> thinking falsely something, that "I am this body." Therefore he's <span class="Italic">vimūḍha.</span> They are animal. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra</span> is there, "I am <span class="Italic">Brahman,</span> spirit soul." But he is thinking, "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am dog," "I am cat." <span class="Italic">Vimūḍhātmā.</span> And this first principle of knowledge they cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Man-manā.</span> That is the only way.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then you never, I mean, even for, it is just like you, even for a moment you slip down, just like a (indistinct). It should be perpetual conscious within yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen Gandhi's prayer meeting, and I attended. Utmost, five minutes reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then again politics immediately. Immediately politics. I was in Delhi. I attended the meeting when <span class="Italic">Nawa Khalia</span> (Noakhali?) fast. So this was his prayer. I have seen. And as a result of this, in that prayer meeting he was killed. (Hindi) So nature punishment are there. (Hindi) The last stage of <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> means you die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But the way the modern civilized nations are exploiting the resources of the world, another fifty years there will be no resources left, and civilization automatically will die out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wars. The occasional war, pestilence, famine, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even there is no war, sir, or no pestilence, the population...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be war. Because you are dissatisfied, I am dissatisfied, on some little provocation we fight. Nobody is happy. I have seen in Allahabad. Little provocation, two brothers fought so much, one brother was killed immediately. Then, when he was ordered to be hanged, his father appealed that "I am the father. One son I have already lost. If he is hanged, then my.... You hang me, my good man(?)." Then he excused him and he actually was.... Upon the father's appeal. I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are very fortunate people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they were Bengalis.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I mean to say they are little <span class="Italic">abhimāna,</span> but what kind of <span class="Italic">abhimāna</span> this is, that "I am God"? Just see how foolish it is. (Hindi) (greets someone) Hare Kṛṣṇa. How are you? [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are doing. We give each word's meaning. Each word of any Sanskrit <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> we give the meaning. That is right.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one is serious to learn, he can learn. There is no difficulty. No, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1].</span> Now, if he inquires, "The word is <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra.</span> Why it is written <span class="Italic">kṣetre</span>?" then it is grammar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I say. That is the way I learned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that, if he likes, he can learn it. <span class="Italic">Saptamī, adhikaraṇa saptamī, sthāna, kṣetra, kṣetre, dharma-kṣetre.</span> If he simply tries to learn the nominative case, the objective case, or like that, then he'll learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Sanskrit) Like that. All things in different ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sañjaya uvāca.</span> It is nominative case. <span class="Italic">Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetāḥ [Bg. 1.1],</span> this is plural number, <span class="Italic">yuyutsavaḥ,</span> plural number. <span class="Italic">Māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva [Bg. 1.1].

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> My meaning was that. My idea was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So any serious student, he can learn at home. It is not very difficult. And after studying one or two or a dozen sentences like that, automatically, yes, he learns <span class="Italic">sandhi,</span> he learns verb, he learns subject, object, everything. No time, otherwise I would have made <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> grammar. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I really meant when I say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do that. You can do that. People will read it, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> grammar. On the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> teach them grammar. Just like Jīva Gosvāmī compiled <span class="Italic">Hari-nāmāmṛta-vyākaraṇa,</span> similarly, you write. You have got both the knowledge, Sanskrit, and through English, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> grammar. People will take it. I have no time; otherwise I have done it. Simply nominative case, objective case, <span class="Italic">śabda-rūpa.</span> Jayapatākā's plan is prepared or not?</div>
