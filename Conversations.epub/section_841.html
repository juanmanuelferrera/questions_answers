<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">mām abhijānāti.</span> By <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> one can understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then they say that understanding means to understand that Kṛṣṇa is just the Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That understanding means that Kṛṣṇa's Brahman only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Kṛṣṇa is representative of Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Brahman is on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham.</span> Why do you go, deviate from the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Anyone who deviates from the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we take him as <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascal. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We don't accept anything else. And we are supported by all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> [break] ...practical result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They try to categorize these modern Hindu deviators, like Vivekananda and Ramakrishna. They try to put them as <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All rascals. They are not <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Last night this boy sits down and immediately he says, "I am a Hindu." I said, "What is this Hindu business? We are not interested in Hindu." Then he said, "Well, you do not know." "How you can say we do not know?" "Well, I was born a Hindu." So I said, "So how you know what I was born? What does that matter, where we were born? A learned person doesn't speak birth." Representing himself as very advanced or something. "Okay, you become Brahman, but we think that that is hell. That is no better than hell for us. And that is the liberation that the demons get. So we are satisfied to chant Kṛṣṇa's name, and we never want to become one. We would rather go to hell, because in hell we can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, but in the Brahman we cannot chant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Staunch adherent. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> ...in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that when a devotee, he sees a banyan, fruit of a banyan tree, and there are so many seeds within that fruit, and each seed can mean one tree and one tree means millions of fruits, and in this way the devotee can appreciate Kṛṣṇa. But the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they go on speculating, and they can never relish anything. The devotee can simply relish how Kṛṣṇa has done everything in the material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can go here? No. And no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It is a little distance there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...devotee is only unhappy to see others unhappy. Does this ever cease? Is a devotee always unhappy because of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Is a devotee always in some anxiety to see others unhappy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How to deliver them? This is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. This kind of anxiety is welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. Is that also in the spiritual world like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In spiritual world there is everything, but only central point is Kṛṣṇa. Here anxiety is "Where I shall get money? Where I shall get woman?" And there is anxiety, "How shall I get Kṛṣṇa?" The anxiety is there. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But do they have anxiety...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here all people are anxious how to get money and how to get woman, that's all. And there the anxiety is how to get Kṛṣṇa. The anxiety is there, but quality is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If we're in anxiety that we cannot perform devotional service nicely, that is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is devotional side. Kṛṣṇa anxiety itself is the first-class devotional service. If one becomes anxious like that, then he is perfect. <span class="Italic">Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate.</span> After many, many millions of life of pious activities one can get such anxiety. This is not so easy, to become anxious for Kṛṣṇa. You don't think it is like ordinary activity (anxiety?). <span class="Italic">Koṭi-sukṛtaiḥ.</span> If one becomes full of anxiety for Kṛṣṇa, that is the highest stage of perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So the anxiety that I am always falling down...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We are in the neophyte stage, and we're often falling down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't imitate. You follow the rules and regulations. Don't try artificially to be anxious. When you are purified, then you'll get that anxiety, not artificially. Then you are <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I don't mean to hanker for the anxiety, but to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anxiety, that is.... That will come, the perfectional stage. Don't try to be perfect artificially. Perfect stage, we have to follow strictly the regulative principle, the injunction of the spiritual master, <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Then you come to that stage. Don't artificially imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What if one keeps falling down from following the regulative principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's falling down? If he's falling down from regulative principles, that means he's falling down to the material world. Falling down means falling down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> [break] ...from the regulative principles and feels anxiety, then that anxiety is material anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's not spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So anxiety for one's self is <span class="Italic">māyā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anxiety for one's self is <span class="Italic">māyā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And anxiety for Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is spiritual. [break] ...Gosvāmī's <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate:</span> "The anxiety for Kṛṣṇa, if it can be purchased, immediately purchase it." Rūpa Gosvāmī said. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatām:</span> "Just purchase Kṛṣṇa anxiety if it is available somewhere." So the next question will be that "What is the price?" <span class="Italic">Tatra laulyam api mūlyam ekalam:</span> "That anxiety can be purchased by anxiety." "So I'll do it." No.<span class="Italic"> Janma-koṭi-sukṛtair na labhyate:</span> "That anxiety is not available even by millions of births' pious activities." So this anxiety is not so easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So if we're performing the Deity worship and we get in anxiety, how to make it nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. That is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. If you become anxious how to worship Deity, how to dress Kṛṣṇa nicely, how to do, if you remain, that will develop your anxiety for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore Deity worship essential. Exactly in time to get up, to offer <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> to dress, this anxiety is the beginning of Kṛṣṇa anxiety. Then, when you become perfect, you'll always be anxious for Kṛṣṇa. And that is perfectional stage. Therefore, by the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> regulative, it is a way of creating that anxiety. So we must follow. Then we'll come to the real anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Not artificially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So therefore it is good that we have so much Deity worship to do that we're very, very busy and we do not have any time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We practically do not have enough time, but that is very good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Enough time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> To worship the Deity. We have so much to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what enough time you want? To go to the cinema? (laughter) Then? Your time has to be occupied by Kṛṣṇa anxiety. That's all. And as soon as you go to other anxiety, then it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> If we have four hours to dress the Deity, we can use the whole four hours. But sometimes we only have an hour and a half, so we have to rush. So that is anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that anxiety does not mean this laziness, that "I am anxiety for four hours. Deity cannot be opened now. I am in anxiety." That is negligence. That is negligence. That is not anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When we are distributing books, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and we are not doing so good and we are in anxiety, that is also spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.... For selling books anxiety is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. If you become very anxious how to sell more books, that is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. That is not trade anxiety; that is Kṛṣṇa anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So some people say that "When I go on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> to sell books I become in too much anxiety if I'm not doing well, so I'd rather not do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. He does not know. Let him know that that is Kṛṣṇa anxiety. Yaśodā, mother Yaśodā, became mother of Kṛṣṇa so that she would always remain in anxiety for Kṛṣṇa, whether Kṛṣṇa is safe. That is mother's anxiety. Therefore she became mother. How to become in Kṛṣṇa anxiety? This philosophy nobody knows. Everyone takes Kṛṣṇa as the father. Father means I'm anxiety-less: "Father, you supply my wants." And to become father of Kṛṣṇa means to purchase anxiety for Kṛṣṇa. This philosophy they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They say, that man the other night, he said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To accept Kṛṣṇa as father means "My father is there. I have no anxiety." And if you accept Kṛṣṇa as your son, then you are full of Kṛṣṇa anxiety. This is the philosophy. And these Māyāvādīs, they cannot understand. They think that Kṛṣṇa is born of this father and mother, how He is God? But they do not know the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They talk of <span class="Italic">śānti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother Yaśodā is always anxious. "Kṛṣṇa is crawling. Whether He is falling down in some water or some monkey has come, hurting Him, or...?" Always. Or "He is touching some fire." Always anxiety. And besides that, the demons are coming. So this is perfection. Always remain in anxiety for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> [break] They just think, <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Māyāvādī rascal, Caitanya Mahāprabhu has condemned them, <span class="Italic">māyāvādī-bhāṣya śunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you hear Māyāvādī association, then your <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> life is finished. Don't touch them. [break] Still, they are little more than the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> [break] ...this place they are dragged through this, what is called? Short grass? Through this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That is anxiety, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That is anxiety, when one goes to Yamarāja and has to face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the result of material anxiety. [break] To become anxiety-less, no more anxiety. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They say, "Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material, <span class="Italic">śocati, kāṅkṣati.</span> But in spiritual world the same <span class="Italic">śocati, kāṅkṣati,</span> is there, but for Kṛṣṇa. First of all you have to negate the material <span class="Italic">śocati, kāṅkṣati.</span> Then spiritual, <span class="Italic">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām.</span> Beginning is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati, samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then spiritual anxiety begins. When this is neutralized, then actual life begins. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Otherwise what is the mean...? <span class="Italic">Mad-bhaktim.</span> In <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> there is anxiety. That is spiritual anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise, what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span>? It comes after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Zero, they are <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī,</span> zero, and <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣavādī.</span> The same thing. But we are not <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī.</span> Whole is not zero. The anxiety.... You cannot become anxiety-less. That is artificial. If you artificially become anxiety-less, then artificially you can remain anxiety-less for some time. Again you fall down. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Falls down. But the anxiety should be purified. That is wanted. Not anxiety-less. You are living being. You cannot be anxiety.... That means you are dead. A living being has no anxiety-that means he is dead. That is not the ideal. The anxiety should be purified from material contamination, and it should be only for Kṛṣṇa. Then it is perfect. Here the anxiety with some designation, "I am the father of this family," this is my anxiety, how to maintain them. "I am the leader of this nation." That is my anxiety. So all these anxieties are material, <span class="Italic">upādhi.</span> I am neither father nor leader. I am servant of Kṛṣṇa. I have created artificial anxieties. So therefore I have to become free from this artificial anxiety. And <span class="Italic">nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa.</span> And when he is pure servant of Kṛṣṇa, he's always anxious how to serve Kṛṣṇa. This is the.... The anxiety is there, and now it is purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">,</span> completely fresh. And then with that senses, <span class="Italic">hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktiḥ.</span> This is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Mad-bhaktim labhate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can't stop, <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> They have to go further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this is negation. Just like one man is diseased. He is also eating, he is also sleeping, but that is not healthy eating, sleeping. He has to get relief from this eating, lying down on the bed and eating by some instrument. This nonsense eating, sleeping should be stopped. And when he's healthy, he eats also, sleeps also. That is different. That is different eating, sleeping, but they do not.... He is suffering from disease. He thinks, "Again eating? Make it zero. Make it zero." This is Māyāvādī<span class="Italic">.</span> He has no taste what is the other eating. He wants to make it zero because here the eating is so botheration, "Oh, let me commit suicide. Make it zero." So that is Buddha philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Sour grapes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is good for the less intelligent class of men. Because they cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> so Buddha therefore says, "First of all make this zero, rascal. Then your real life begins." But what is that real life he did not say, because the rascals will not understand. Simply advised, "You make this zero, <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī.</span>" Then, when time will come, he will understand what is positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this process is <span class="Italic">su-sukham,</span> very, very joyful. So how can we explain to the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> that this anxiety...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not feeling joyful? To chant, dance, and eat <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is not joyful? Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what do you want more? And simply by chanting, dancing, and eating <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> you are making progress. Therefore it is <span class="Italic">su-sukham.</span> You haven't got to press your nose and make your head down and starve for three hundred years, nothing like that. Go to the forest, go to the Himalayas.... No. At your place you chant, dance, and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> (in car) Therefore any other argument that we present, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no argument. "You remain yourself. Let us remain peaceful. You remain peaceful. We are following our <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span>" <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But I think they are doubtful, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise why they complain? They're doubtful.</div>

You have come to the light, just like you have come to the sunshine, light, but does not mean that you have gone to the sun globe or you have seen the sun-god. That will take many millions of years to become so perfect. But you have come to the light-that much credit to you. That is ordinary. Everyone sees the sunlight. That does not require much endeavor. But if you want to go to the sun globe and enter there to see the sun-god, then that requires special qualification. So you are ordinary man. You have come to the light from darkness. That much credit to you, that's all.</div>
