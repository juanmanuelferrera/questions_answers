<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> With the press from the <span class="Italic">Indian Express</span> and other newspapers. And also I went to the television and the All-India Radio for the engagement. And also I wanted to discuss with some of my members the immediate plan that we have. So I sent one to Bombay to organize a conference. So I'll try to cover this area very quickly, Agra, Delhi, and Punjab. I'm meeting a lot of scientists. And also I collected several copies of the newspaper, <span class="Italic">The Statesman.</span> I went to the <span class="Italic">Statesman</span> building, collected the newspaper coverings. How are you feeling, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> did not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> What happened? No one knows. They left. They say he left Calcutta at twelve o'clock flight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I could have gone to the airport. Maybe they are coming tomorrow on the train, Taj Express?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> No, by air they came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, from Delhi. I thought that maybe he didn't know that, Adri...? If it starts from Calcutta at twelve o'clock, it should be arriving at Delhi about two o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Then let's say one hour, then three to here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There's a train at five o'clock that I came by, train, five o'clock. It's a very good train. Maybe they didn't know that train. It starts from Nizammudin Station. So if they're planning to come by train tomorrow, the Taj Express is at seven o'clock in the morning, arriving Mathurā at nine o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Someone could call Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I don't know whether they're in the temple or not. I think some of our men came from Delhi temple about four o'clock, arrived in the temple. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we discussed a number of points. One thing is that I talked to him about Panchashil flat. So I explained to him that he should feel the responsibility for paying for the living there, as we have given him this nice place. So he's agreed to do that. And I told him that whatever he pays, the receipts should be in your name, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami. Apparently the receipts have been issued in the name of M. M. De. So I told him don't do that, because if they get the receipts in their name then they become the tenant. I don't want that. They're living there as our guest, not as tenants. So he agreed to that. As soon as I mentioned it, he understood what I was talking about. M. M. is a little clever. So then I told him, however, that the permanent electricity was never hooked up. Permanent electricity line was never installed. So since that was an initial giving of the flat, I told him that if he paid for half of that, we would pay the other half. I said but first of all he has to pay and send me the receipt showing that he's paid. It's about 650 rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six hundred and fifty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half. It's thirteen hundred total. This is for permanent connection of electricity. The flat never has had a permanent connection. The whole building is not permanent. It's a temporary line. So all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yearly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. Once and for all. It's a permanent installation of a permanent line. The yearly electricity bill he'll pay. That's his business. Then he seems to want to repay this amount that we're giving from the postal receipts. So I have no objection. If he repays, then we'll simply follow the original scheme and divide it up accordingly. Or he can divide it up. I don't know why he wants to pay it back. I don't know. I've explained to him that it's a donation. But anyway, it's better he pays it back, and then we can give it to each of the persons involved. I don't think there's any need of taking any loan agreement or anything, is there? Is there any need?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean verbal agreement is enough, isn't it, in dealing with him? I would think so. I mean I thought it was sufficient if he agrees verbally. No contract or loan agreement. He wants to pay this money back by April. I didn't tell him he had to. I told him it was a donation. He seems to want to pay it back. So let him if he wants to. Then he wanted me to arrange, so I'm sending... I gave the receipts to him as you saw. I'm sending the letter... I'm sending a man to Delhi tomorrow to get a ticket for him, airline ticket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's gone to take his meals now. Then he's going to take rest, he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he has got the papers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He gave them back to me to keep in the almirah locked up. He said until he goes he wants me to keep them carefully. I said all right. And I'm getting him a ticket as well as sending the letters by special mail service to Bombay for Girirāja's signature, so that at least from our side there will not be any reason to delay. And when I showed him the letter that I had written to the bank, he was very satisfied. He could understand that there should be no difficulty now. He was quite confident after reading the letter. The letter is very clearly written, and with the power of attorney it's a complete document. I think everything was done all right. He seemed to be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what about <span class="Italic">kavirāja?</span> He might think it is a whimsical. And that was my last desire. You could not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> I wanted. Somehow or other, it has not happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't feel that it's conclusively not happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply, one after another, frustration.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. First we had that Madhva..., not Madhva. Rāmānujī came from Śrī Raṅgajī temple, and he seemed to be a cheater. Then this one... We got this medicine from that <span class="Italic">śakta-kavirāja,</span> and that medicine turned out to be poison. And now this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> who's supposed to be coming from Calcutta, it's become a mystery where he is. The temple was called, and they said that they've left. They called twice to Calcutta, and they said they've left, and yet he's not here. I don't know what to make of it. Very puzzling situation. I think that if by tomorrow noon they have not arrived, then Śatadhanya can go to Calcutta to bring them. If they're going to arrive, they'd arrive by tomorrow noon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, at the latest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At the latest absolutely. I mean, to me, for them to arrive by tomorrow noon is not... From the very beginning I would not have felt it was out of the ordinary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They said they have left!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Still, whatever the reason is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not talking... Everything is being done by the same Śatadhanya. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By the same what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śatadhanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughter) Yeah, that's maybe what the problem is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people are bluffing him, and he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's bluffing us. (laughs) He seems very sincere, though. It's hard not to believe him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was my impression. But how is that? If you take leave, something.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is a big mystery, this <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja.</span> It is like the immortal elixir, very hard to grasp. I think you described the flowers in the sky? There's that Bengali...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> <span class="Italic">Ākāśa-puṣpa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Well, one thing we could say in favor of the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> delay in coming is that if he had come, then he might have given some medicine right away. But this way, your body has been given a chance to rest from that other thing that you had taken. By not taking medicine for two days now, it's good. It's made... The body will become a little more regular. If he had come, naturally he would have wanted to immediately prescribe some medicine. This is not bad, to give the body a rest after such strong medicine. How much did Prabhupāda drink today? The stool-passing has stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Better that you don't drink any more tonight, Śrīla Prabhupāda, except a little bit of <span class="Italic">miśri-jala</span> or some little bit. Then by tomorrow you should be more normal again. Anyway, our activities are going on-<span class="Italic">parikrama, kīrtana, Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can I go to Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I still feel a little confident that we could take you there, but... I mean just like we carry you in the palanquin and you don't have any difficulty, so airplane is like a big palanquin. I mean, you know, there's so many of us, eight or ten of us. I can't see that there could be any difficulty. Of course, I still think the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is going to come. I have faith in Śatadhanya Mahārāja. I think this is simply Kṛṣṇa's test for him. I think the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> will come. The nicest thing will be if the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> treats you for some days, and you get some benefit, and then he takes you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (?) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We go back with him to Calcutta and Māyāpura. That would be very nice. Of course, he has to first of all come here. I've seen things like this happen before in India, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean India is the kind of place where... It's difficult. You could drop out of communication for a day. It's very possible that that can happen. It's just a very strange kind of place to communicate and to travel in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Another thing is I think this noon flight is not a direct flight. It's a Kanadu(?) that hops, say, from Calcutta, Benares, Allahabad, Lucknow, Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. So how many hours could that be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Five, six hours. Takes a long time. And it's not as fast as Boeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means it would arrive at 6:30 or 7:00. I think that by tomorrow noon, if they didn't come, then we would have to say that the matter has become hopeless for them coming. And really it's a fact, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you've been resting today without taking any medicine is not a bad thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And the passing stool has stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, that stopped. That's the main thing. That was the disturbance. The stool was passing. So many people are coming to the temple here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Many pilgrims. The temple is full of people all the time. Lots of pilgrims coming. Devotees were saying that in other temples there's not so much activity. Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma are attracting all of the people of the land. Everyone is attracted to Them. But it seems like Rādhā-Śyāmasundara are equally popular. People like Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa very much, and especially in Vṛndāvana. But Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma is unique. I hear them exclaiming. They are at once surprised and pleased to see the two brothers together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And the <span class="Italic">śṛṅgāra</span> is so unique here. It's the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, everyone says the <span class="Italic">śṛṅgāra</span> is the best. But for flowers we have not yet the best. So we have to make that. Bhavānanda Mahārāja was suggesting a program, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He was suggesting that in that open land on the side of the Gurukula, that we could build a <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> pavilion, and we could serve the public every day free p<span class="Italic">rasādam</span> at noon time. That might become very popular in Vṛndāvana. <span class="Italic">Ḍāl</span> and <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis. </span>All the <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> would come. I don't know if it's a good idea, but he was suggesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good idea. Very good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nayanābhirāma:</span> We used to serve them <span class="Italic">khicuṛi</span> in the morning. Then they discontinued.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean so many pilgrims come, and there are already so many <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> living in Vṛndāvana. This would make our temple very, very popular additionally, even more popular than now. So many pilgrims come. I see them. And they're farmers and things, you know. And if we gave that, probably they would be inclined, even some of the farmers would bring a little of their..., you know, thinking to offer something also to the Deities, because they would see that we're giving things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you distribute <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> there will be no scarcity of participants. <span class="Italic">Bhāta ei kāke āra.(</span>?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What does that mean, Śrīla Prabhupāda? What does that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> "If you scatter rice, then there's no dearth of crows." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "No dearth of crows."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll come by the bunches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems like there's a Bengali proverb for practically everything, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ektu bhauma bhauma deśa tabu raṅge bara.</span>(?) Explain this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That "Bengal has been divided into so many different parts, but still it's full of <span class="Italic">rasas</span> and humor."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bengali people are easy-going. So therefore they can manufacture all these humors. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would your Guru Mahārāja tell a lot of Bengali proverbs, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. I learned from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You once said that he liked you very much, 'cause you were also a Calcutta boy, Calcutta born. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sohar(?) has money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually I started to have a talk with him about the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You write. You are intelligent. I cannot do anything. I only want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (crying) I am very poor man, and somehow or other, I built up. And still in my...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The problems are that... The biggest problem...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is the urine report? Where is Bhakti-caru?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">[break] (<span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> and Prabhupāda-Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Since when is that dropsy?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, one year... Less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I mean, I asked Hari-śauri. He said that that swelling has been there for a long time, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I've seen it for... (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> This is Adri-dhāraṇa dāsa, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I told you about him, that he's collecting very big in Calcutta, making many members. So he has come with the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> personally.</div>

<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Bold">October 28, 1977, Vṛndāvana</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Tamāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I mean, er, we already said some juices, vegetable juice. You said you have no objection to broth, vegetable broth. So he's proposing some vegetable broth. That's nice. We can try. And... You see, you have to understand, one thing is that Prabhupāda willingly takes fruit juices. You've never experienced a patient like Prabhupāda, who will not take what you prescribe. Everybody that you've worked with, they take whatever you tell them to take. But Śrīla Prabhupāda is not that kind of patient. You tell him to take... You'll make a broth for six hours, and he'll take one spoon and then reject it. And then that's finished. So the point is that if he willingly takes some type of a fruit juice, for example, and we've seen for example how he willingly will take grape juice in big quantities. He may not take the thing which you prescribe in big quantities. Better that he takes some liquid than nothing at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhava:</span> This is very true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the proposal that he continues to take some fruit juice has certain merit, because at least we've seen that that's one thing that he will take in large quantity. If nothing else... Every single <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> and doctor we've consulted, they all insist that one of the most important things is that there be sufficient liquid taken so that the body can be cleansed properly. So although you may be right that by taking one thing in particular and not taking fruit juice may be preferable, if he can't take it, then there's no use in that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhava:</span> That's true. If Śrīla Prabhupāda would take nothing but fruit juice, it is much better that he have the fruit juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So therefore Svarūpa Dāmodara Prabhu's suggestion was not unbased, because we see that in the past Prabhupāda has rejected... I've seen him reject vegetable broths. I saw him reject it at least three or four times. I've never seen him reject fruit juice. So how much vegetable broth will Prabhupāda take? He won't take 500, 600, 800 cc's. He may, but I've never seen such a thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He'll take one glass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you have to consider that, although he should take sufficient liquid. So you have to augment... [break] ...Śatadhanya, when we called Calcutta, and then I could not fall asleep properly because I was very... My mind was active last night. For three hours I was not sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the back side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Little scratching, should I do? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">krama</span> on the palanquin, practically it is very pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You look very much like you're enjoying when we take you around. It's very nice to see that you're happy then. [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda, when someone is ill as Your Divine Grace is, it's always a case of lamentation, but somehow or other, because of your most wonderful Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is simply nectarean to be with you. [break] ...Indian Overseas Bank. So Prabhupāda's idea is that all of you should get sufficiently everything that you require, that you should never feel any difficulty. But he is very concerned that the money should not be squandered. [break] ...going to deal with the letter. He simply instead told you to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I have sent money twice. Once in Vṛndāvana and Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we got the 870 rupees. That we received here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But took from Prabhupāda personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. But so far, the payment to the BBT has not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No, BBT is being arranged. I shall send check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think your outstanding bill is about 25,000 rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that has not been paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, why you have not paid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> That is also on a check basis. On its encashment I shall send a draft to BBT. I got some outstanding checks. So it takes time, at least a month or more than a month. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're going to give his business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But I wrote to Prabhupāda some loan that is to be repaid in April positively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Regarding this loan, you were to make twelve percent out of it. Right? You were going to make twelve thousand rupees' profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the investment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> One <span class="Italic">lakh.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you're not making one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No. Profit is twelve thousand, yes, twelve to fifteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now by these postal receipts, you're making 27,000, apart from your brother's amount. Yours, your mother's and your sister's will give you 27,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No. I want that loan for the time being. I shall pay it back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But that loan... You have to understand something. The Society cannot loan...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the money he can take, loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the basis of that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> It is for a month or three or four months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no, that's not what Prabhupāda's saying. On the basis of those postal receipts. Is that what you're saying, Śrīla Prabhupāda? You can put up those postal receipts, that money, to the bank, and they can issue you loan against that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I don't think so. I don't know, actually, because I don't have any idea about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because, Śrīla Prabhupāda, our Society cannot loan money for a business like this. This is not our Society's business at all. You're not... Of the one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees' worth of books, only six thousand rupees is from ISKCON's books. So how can we loan one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees? We can't start loaning money for these kind of businesses. It's against the Society's memorandum and rules that money can be given to individuals for their personal businesses. This is a charitable society. It's bounded by the Society's charity laws. So, Prabhupāda, whatever money he has, he has got as a <span class="Italic">binamida</span> of the Society. He may donate the money in the sense of giving a stipend to family members. That's different. But as far as giving loans for business purposes to an individual private business... I mean we would lose our charitable status, because the accounts are audited every year. So it will look very... In fact, if we do that, then they may raise objection to the stipend also. Now they can't raise objection, because it's given as a stipend to the family, former family of this <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> They won't say anything. But if we start taking Society money and loaning it to a private business, which is the way they'll see it, then they'll raise objection. Furthermore, then we'll have to charge interest, and if we charge interest, that gets us into a lot of trouble also. As a Society, we're not supposed to be doing business, profit-making business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when the certificates matures, what is the amount?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The amount, I believe, is about 43,200 rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this much can be given to him. You can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That amount can be given to him, and he may pay back the loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But he's getting the postal receipts, so let him keep those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When it is matured...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's going to be matured in ten days, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I don't think it's advisable that we should pass entries in our accounts simply for ten days' time. By the time he goes back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. He may take indirectly for the purpose with the help of Sandar.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he can take that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That I also say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is 47,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 43,200 rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So seven thousand you can give, contribution. In that way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Whatever the amount I may take, I can pay back by 10th or 15th April, positively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He'll get 43,200 by the 7th of November.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Because we have got an order from the National Library of Calcutta worth one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So supply him half the order to begin with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why not do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> It is on our confirmation, because the money is the main criterion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You'll have the money by the 7th of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I don't have any such big amount. But if you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. The postal receipts. But some of the money is to Sulaksmana De, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Some of this money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, all the money he can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But that's not what we wrote in the letter, though, because the letter nominated different persons. Then we're going to have to do a completely different thing. Because the nomination was already designated to five different persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think he can have the... I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I also do not know the procedure. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> The 7th November is the last date to confirm them, and I shall be going back by 3rd or 4th of... Of course, tickets available. I shall send my man to Delhi, and he'll arrange everything about books supplying and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How much you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> How much you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> That money? Or that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Generally how much cash do you have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Cash? At present? Only ten thousand, eight thousand or nine thousand, something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So arrange to give him that 47,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's 43,200. But I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No, you'll get the money back by 10th or 15th April.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's not the point. The problem is that how we can get... I don't know if this... I mean I'll do it, but I'm thinking that we're jeopardizing our position as a... I mean this money is not a privately owned money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the Society cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can the Society give money to a private business? It's not done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No, it is just a temporary... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is in my private account?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, Śrīla Prabhupāda, according to your affidavit, there is no private accounts. Once we take it as a private account again, then the whole position of the affidavit has no meaning. I mean, I really think that Vrindavan has to... I just think he has to arrange these businesses on his own. I don't think that he can... He can use the money that's given as a stipend. He can use this postal money receipts. But if he has to take money from the Society for private business, it's not at all going to be acceptable to the Charity Commission. It makes us look very suspicious that we're giving money to individuals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this 43,000 can be given, because it is not Society's money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. It's not come in our accounts, so it can be given definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this much you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I fully agree. And I have no objection to giving one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> But I'm speaking from a legal point of view. It will injure us, and I don't want to be injured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No, I can spare some little amount of interest. I can pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's more jeopardizing. We can't charge interest. We cannot make profit on money loaned out, as a society. It goes against the laws of India. That's the whole point. Even if we gave it in any way, it's jeopardizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But you can put it easily on donation account, that charge interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Overseas Bank they can give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Overseas Bank, they can give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On what basis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Against their money. [break] You are depositing some money with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We've already deposited money with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So against that, they can give. Bank can give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think I'll write a letter to Girirāja. It will take some time. Vrindavan will have to go to Bombay for this if he wants to negotiate this loan. The loan has to be between the bank and him, not between our Society and the bank. That's my point. It's his private business. It has to be kept on a basis like that. Otherwise it's... If the bank... Girirāja may help them. Now we've given the bank instruction that five persons... See, one thing is that all... [break] This... If you think this arrangement suitable, then give them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> It is, moreover, a prestigious issue to us. And we have already committed them that we are able to supply, although we don't have any sufficient money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I think, based upon this scheme...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> And that's why I sent my man twice to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know, but Prabhupāda was not... We never saw your man. He missed us. He missed both times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> When he came here, Prabhupāda had already left for London. And when my man went to Bombay, already left for Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in business field, if the bank sees that you have got fifty percent, they will advance. If you have got fifty percent, any transaction, you wait to do some business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> One thing, Tamāla, you know, I would like to have Prabhupāda's car for the time being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But Prabhupāda said you had to pay five thousand rupees to BBT. That you haven't done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> After paying of this amount the car may be arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But first of all you have to pay the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> All right, I will... (Bengali )</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We already told you if you paid that money, Prabhupāda said then you can have the use of the car. But they have not received that money from you. I mean, actually, the fact of the matter is that you have got a 25,000 rupees bill outstanding which you have not hardly paid anything for in over a year. Now, from the point of view of business, this is not very good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I received a letter from Prabhupāda a couple of month ago that the amount which is due from us to BBT, that amount should be adjusted through order, which Gargamuni...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Actually if you read the letter carefully you'll see that Prabhupāda pointed out that the amount that you would get on credit from Gargamuni was equal to the amount of your bill. He didn't say that it would be adjusted. I have a copy of the letter. It doesn't say that it will be adjusted against that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No. Prabhupāda advised Gargamuni to pay interest in our favor to the BBT account to clear out our plea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So far. I... I know it's being paid to your account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> That is why I have not sent any money to BBT. Anyway, I'm arranging to pay BBT immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some money should be paid. I mean 25,000 rupees' books were taken and no money was received. Very little money was received. I mean, I think to establish credibility some money should be paid. It's only right. The BBT has supplied books. Some money should come back. Otherwise there's a feeling that it's a very one-way business-simply books go out and no money is ever coming in. I think that from your side there should be some... Prabhupāda's only point with the car was to get you to give some money towards the BBT. That was the whole point. Otherwise he could give you the use of the car right away, but he wanted to encourage you that some money should be given to the BBT. The car is there in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I shall send three thousand rupees, as I have committed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When you send five thousand, then take the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> At present I have arranged to pay BBT three thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But I must get the confirmation. Otherwise he is not ready to deliver the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I told the BBT that they should write you as soon as they receive five thousand rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I must have some letters. On the strength of the letters I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What letters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> That "Please allow the car to Prabhupāda's son."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The letter is already there. I've sent him a letter with... I sent the letter, so he knows that. The letter is there. But they have to receive five thousand rupees from you, and then they'll release the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Because if the confirmation of the amount received by mail reaches very late, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you have not sent the money, Vrindavan. So why you're worried about the letter reaching late? First of all send the money, then worry about it. There's no worry. Once you send the money, the letter will come. I don't think that you can doubt that the letter will come. The main point is that the money has to come first. You have no reason to suppose that the letter will be delayed. It will come. They already know it. As soon as they receive five thousand rupees, the BBT, Bombay, will immediately inform Māyāpura, "Five thousand rupees been received. The car may be given." They know that. It's set up. It's a set-up. And you have to live up to your side to pay the five thousand rupees. It's not very much. It's not that much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, with the help of Tamāla Kṛṣṇa and who else? Chandra. You can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take this order, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And if the bank sees that you have got fifty percent, they will advance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Especially with the presentation of the bill. Against the bill...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...they'll put it out. The bill should be approved by the company that's ordering the books. The government should certify the bill that "We've accepted this bill." Oh, the bank will immediately issue money. They're going to make interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So with cooperation of Tamāla and who else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chandra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chandra. And with your intelligence you can manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. You have to apply your intelligence to this. It's no doubt you're going to have to work hard to get this money. But otherwise where is any business successful unless there's endeavor? The money is there. It's a fact you'll have to work for it. That's a fact. I can see that. It's not completely simple, but it's there. Good business, it can be gotten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can return immediately with the certificate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I think you should do that. Should not lose time now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Chandra there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (to Vrindavan:) Whatever you need from here, I will help you. As far as I can do, any letters or anything I can give you, I am prepared to do. And I can give you the counterfoils, and I'll also give him the safe custody receipt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will be further help. I mean, with presentation of these, this shows that you have position to demand this money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When the bank collects, the post office will not have any objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a fact. If the bank takes money, the post office will pay as the bank orders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But is it possible to...? In case those counterfoils... It is only mentioned in the one line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Bank will not accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda said it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Doesn't matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Post office should be satisfied. They have paid to the bank, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And how will the bank pay to him alone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How will the bank pay to Vrindavan-candra alone and not the others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Hm, this is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I will write a letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I write Vrindavan-candra or Vrinda Book Company or whatever it may be, I don't think that Bank will make it encashed to Vrindavan Company. It will be troublesome thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it won't be troublesome. The best thing... We can't, though. The best thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda-I will give a letter informing the bank to make payment to Vrindavan-candra alone. Beyond that, I will also immediately write another of the same letter with my signature and get Girirāja's signature, and I will, at the same time, give Vrindavan-candra a copy of the power of attorney, so that first of all you'll have my letter... Just like this: if Prabhupāda were to sign a letter to the bank to pay all the money to you, will they pay it to you? Definitely. Right? So he's given power of attorney jointly to myself and Girirāja in Bombay. Since I... I will sign one letter just myself, and you try and work on that letter. And I'll give you a copy of the power of attorney. At the same time I'll send the exact same letter, but with a place for Girirāja also to sign. Means it will reach Calcutta another four or five days after you reach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> For the accounts being offered by Prabhupāda? So bank will accept the signature, only those who operates the account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Exactly. But Prabhupāda has given power of attorney to operate all accounts to myself and Girirāja jointly. That's what I'm saying. I'll give you a copy of the power of attorney, notarized copy, and I'll give you a letter, stating to the bank that all of the money should be paid to your Vrinda Book Company. You follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Not to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. To Vrinda Book Company. And I'll get that letter signed by Girirāja also. The fact is, you don't need that letter before the 7th of November, because that's when the payment has to be made. You follow? There's plenty of time. There's ten days' time. For me to give a letter... The letter will be taken to Delhi. It will reach Bombay on Monday. Definitely. I'll send it by QMS. They'll send it to Calcutta by QMS. It will reach by Tuesday. It will reach by the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Tuesday evening possibly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By the 2nd or 3rd of the month it will reach. Plenty of time for you to act on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I should be back by 3rd or 4th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You should be back as soon as possible to start working on this. If I were you, I would not lose time. I would act quickly on it. And from our side, I'm sure this will work. I guarantee it will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> If it works, then we have no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It must work, because they have to honor the power of attorney. I'll give you the copy of the power of attorney. It's completely bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> You arrange everything, write down all these and signing, put your signature on the letters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I'll do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But I may not come back in a very short time, if I have to come within a month. For this work I may not find out any time to come over here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, you won't have to come back for this business. This business will be done properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But I must see my father, after all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That you may come every day. But from this business, this will work. We'll give a letter to the bank...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> For the little later the work should not be hampered. I want that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it won't be hampered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give me. He'll go.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Because I came, spending so many money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it won't be hampered. I promise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I came by air-conditioned chair car. Took a hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I'll pay you back that. You don't have to be... That money we'll always pay you. Whenever you want to visit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Will you be able to arrange a ticket for 3rd or 4th? Because I asked Ramesh. He told me that better to ask...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I don't advise you to arrange for 3rd or 4th. I tell you that you should go back as soon as possible and begin to work on this. What will be benefit by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> If I get it on 2nd. Because tomorrow's ticket may not be available or day after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let us see what I can arrange. How you want to go? By Toofan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Yes. That can be... But I was feeling most uneasy in the air-conditioned chair car, because the outside climate was very cold, and inside was very cold the whole night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Toofan would be better? Kalka Mail is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Calcutta from Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Then where should I stay in the night? It leaves at eight o'clock in the morning to Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stay at our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Toofan is better I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> As this Mail from here, Mathurā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So where to get the...? I don't want to get the tickets from Mathurā. I want to get the tickets from Delhi. That is my point. I will arrange to purchase a ticket from Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> But where can I stay in the night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you can go by plane. We shall pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. His only point is where he will stay at night. But I'm telling him he can stay in our Delhi center very comfortably. See, if we get the tickets from Delhi I can arrange... There's no... The main thing is I want to purchase the ticket originating in Delhi. Then you have a confirmed reservation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Because a Deluxe leaves in the afternoon. That would be better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Deluxe from Delhi. So it passes by Tundla. So you can pick it up there. You don't even have to go all the way to Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> No, if I can start in the morning I can reach by two or three o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But even if you have to go in the morning from Delhi, I can arrange for your accommodation in Delhi very nicely. My letter to them will give you very good accommodation in Delhi center, very comfortable. You're not inconvenienced here. You're staying overnight here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can return to Delhi in the after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> See, because I know you can get reservations immediately to go to Calcutta from Delhi. (aside:) You were just there. You know that. Because there's so many trains going, Delhi-Calcutta, and if you purchase the ticket here or if you purchase the ticket from Mathurā you'll wait ten days. Remember how we had to wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Last time I paid ten rupees as bribe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And even then we couldn't get immediately. But in Delhi we can get it immediately. Especially with foreign quota, it's very easy. They give immediately ticket. You can get the same night. So I'll arrange that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> So I can go to Delhi day after tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Like that. I'll arrange and I'll give you a letter. You go. In any case you go to the Delhi temple. Today itself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I don't know the place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'll give you all details. And I'll make all of the arrangements for you to be able to go. Today itself we'll purchase the ticket, and then they'll telephone us what day the ticket is for. That's not difficult. I'll send a man also. Did you have your bath yet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've got a room yet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I'm going to arrange for his room and everything, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali) Somebody has arrived on 13th from Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> To Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Thirteenth. Thirtieth October someone is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Thirteenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your man, you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> My man met with Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali) Because my man arrived on 4th, and he came back on 6th because Dhana Jani(?) was already booked from Calcutta. He delivered some fruits or something to your devotee in Bombay. I don't think that... There is a list...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we never got. I don't think we got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> And we have also sent some letter with Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. Never received?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That I think we received. We got a lot of letters from you. None of them were replied because of Prabhupāda's health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I got seven or eight letters from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> There was no tickets available before 10th or 11th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> To, by Toofan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Toofan is hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Even by Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but we'll get from Delhi side. That was <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> First I got a ticket on 30th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If I don't get the ticket by train, then I'll book a plane ticket.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan:</span> Train is... And I'm not a man of that position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Let us see. If necessary we'll... In any case we're paying for your..., always, whenever you come to see Prabhupāda. So let us first try for train, and if we see that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we see that there's no trains available, then we'll book a plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you can book a plane, accordingly. You can return immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You send your telegram. [break] Well, I consider him as a Godbrother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You wrote in your book that the spiritual master's family, former family, should be considered in a reverential way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. No, when I write him a letter I say, "Please accept my humble obeisances." So I write him as a Godbrother. He also writes to me like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do the needful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> ...was present there also, so he can confirm that we spoke with him and he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, "Confirmed... I approached and he has spoken"-these things are going on. These things are paid.(?) Everything is lost. You talked personally with him, and he said that he's very responsible, and he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> He's proved responsible in the past.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> In the past he has always been responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Sometimes it's not possible also to get a flight. Sometimes it's full.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are simply suggesting. Actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Actually we don't know why he has not yet come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you said that you talked with him personally. Did you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You talked personally, he was going in the morning, and where is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Yes, he said he was immediately going. He said he was going to immediately go and see that <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> and ask him to come and then get on the first plane he could get. That's what he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> That's Haṁsadūta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhava:</span> We can begin the bath now, Śrīla Prabhupāda? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...tomorrow probably. (indistinct) ...loan... Actually we're not loaning him that money. That money is being given as a gift to him. He was willing to pay it back. I said, no, this is a gift from you to him for improving his business. I said actually it's meant for each of the family members. I told him, "You use it now for improving your business. Then if business increases, you can eventually pay each one of them the money that they should have gotten." He said, "Very nice." And I explained to him what squandering meant. Now it is very clear. I told him that "You can use the money each month that you get. And all of you can use it for three things: for purchasing property, increasing business or buying government stocks." I said, "Prabhupāda's point is that whatever he's given you, it should increase in its value. He wants to see that it increases." And now it's very definite, so... Again I explained to him how there should be no difficulty with this, getting this... He's a little lazy. He's lazy. I could see that when he thought that the money was a donation, I think it came in his mind that "Even if the business deal doesn't go through, I still get the money." He should be encouraged, but his tendency is to be a little lazy. They should not be given money easily, too easily. Otherwise they won't work hard. He's also getting some money, he told me, from a fixed deposit in Calcutta from the BBT which he uses for travel expenses. He says gradually he will be paying some of that money back. He said that's why he sent you sometimes... He recently sent 870 rupees. He says that he's using it for travel expenses, and he may pay it back. I didn't know if you had arranged anything regarding that. You expect him to pay that money back, or not necessarily? It should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I expect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One thing I got a good feeling this time, today, from speaking with him is that I feel very confident about our dealings together. I found that they have no mischievous plan. They're simple. And that relaxed my mind a lot when I saw that. If anything, they're a little worried that they won't get a monthly amount. I said, "Don't worry about that." I think also that he'll keep his word, means that if some agreement... Just like if I said to him that "When the business becomes better, you may pay the other members," I think they'll live up to whatever the word is, you know, because they're always afraid that they may not get the monthly amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guide them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They are simple people. That's the feeling I got today. So I'll pay him whatever he expended for coming here plus his airfare to go back to Calcutta. And probably I'll suggest that he leave tomorrow. He wanted to spend more time, but I told him that "Now you should do this business and don't delay now. This is not the time to take extra time. You can come back later on." Pisimā's son's name is Chandra? Hm. Bhakti-caru has his address. Is the diarrhea more or less stopped now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> He hasn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Passed any stool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> That one in the morning was only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Little, little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Little, like Bhakti-caru said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So tonight, Śrīla Prabhupāda, tonight you have not passed anything. Then you try to take something, drinking something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm drinking something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not very much today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I drink very much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it's relative, I mean to say. Just like you can drink up to a thousand cc's in a day. Today probably there hasn't been so much. Today has been only about 300 that you drank. So I'm just saying that better to take it easy today. But by tonight, if everything is all right...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means there will be stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. That was only when you were taking that medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the bowel is loose, whatever I will take, it will go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. You can feel that it's still loose. How long will it remain like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. You can feel that it's loose. That's different. Isn't there some... I know that like sometimes if I have this problem, there's certain things that one can take which make it, the bowel tightened up. Like I know I would take sometimes rice and plantain. It wouldn't have a good effect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rice I cannot touch even. If I hear about rice, any solid food, immediately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vomiting tendency. Hm. Then fasting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The bowels should become tighter after a day or two. It shouldn't remain loose for so many days. I mean, surely it must get tighter. The medicine caused it to become like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he's taking the certificate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When he goes I'll give it to him. He'll take the certificates, and I'll dictate a letter. I'll write a letter to the bank, which I'll send to Bombay for Girirāja's signature. I'll also give him a copy of the notary of the power of attorney. So with all of these documents... He has sufficient time. It's only on the 7th of November that it comes due. With Chandra's help, he can get everything. Then it's up to him to negotiate with the bank for the loan. I don't think I should do that for him. I'm a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> If I have to start doing his business for him..., I don't think you would want me to do that, do you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not to help him... If he can get some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe he should try to get the loan through the Central Bank, Camac Street. They might be more inclined. They know he's, I think, connected with Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got some Central Bank passbooks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have Central Bank passbooks. I don't know if I have one with us. It may be in Bombay or Calcutta. Just the fact that that bank is familiar with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have to see where there is account money. I cannot remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, I've got it... I mean I'm doing good on this. You mean just in general to keep everything properly. Is that what you mean, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean generally to keep everything in order. Yes, I have a very good hold on it. Some things... You know, because formerly they never kept these things down. Now I'm finding out things. But whenever I get extra information, I note it. Pretty much I have all of the things in order. Just like now I just found out for the first time that he's getting a monthly interest from one of the fixed deposits in the name of BBT. That was never noted. So when I find out the amount, I'll just note it. Then I can deduct it each month from the account that I'm keeping. Like that, sometimes I get new information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have to search out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but I've actually been doing that. And I've also been checking whenever they give interest that it's exactly the right amount. I make sure each year they credit the interest, keeping watch carefully of the fixed deposits to see when they come matured, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only thing is that M. M. De and Sulaksmana. They should not be given more than twelve...(?) (two hundred...?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The only thing is about M. M. De? I've just dictated a letter to the Central Bank of India. I'm going to send this letter to Girirāja that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has become Communist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're giving him no..., 250 now, but 750 is put in fixed deposit for him. The total is a thousand rupees he's getting. He only gets 250. But the other part is put into fixed deposit for seven years. I don't want to change that letter to the bank, because we've given it as a standing order now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can simply get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two-fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's all that any of them get right now. And the rest goes into fixed deposit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they may remain, lifetime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Provided they don't squander it. If they squander, then it will go to the charity. And now it's very easy for me to check up once a year. I'll just see how they have used the money. They'll have to show me that it's invested somehow. And if they can't show me, then I'll threaten them that "If you don't change this... You must change it. Otherwise the money will be given to charity." And they'll do it. If they use it for investing, then the interest they make in investment, that they can do anything they want with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what about this <span class="Italic">kavirāja?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śatadhanya just placed a lightning call to Delhi to see if they've heard anything. Otherwise, if he doesn't hear anything, he may have to go to Calcutta himself. One thing is that I did not expect that within... You know, as we called this morning, I did not expect that the man would come here by this afternoon. I mean a thing like this has to take a least a day's time. The man has to be informed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Whether actually any talk was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, Jayapatākā... The original message came from Jayapatākā to Gopāla Kṛṣṇa in Delhi, and he said that he had personally, so far Gopāla told me that this was coming from Jayapatākā, that Jayapatākā told him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Gopāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in Bombay. He's gone to Bombay. I mean we'll know... Personally, I think that within a day's time you'll know everything about this <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> If there's no such thing, then you'll know that. If there is, you'll either see him here or you'll get news of when he's coming. Or you may get news that there's no way he can come; we have to come there. But I think within a day's time you'll get the news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this boy Śatadhanya, he said, "I have personally talked. He is very responsible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Adri-dhāraṇa. He personal... Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what kind of responsible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I don't think it's irresponsible. This is still too early to be expecting that we would definitely have heard anything. Sometimes... There's so many reasons why it would take this long to even contact the man. Supposing the man has gone out of the city for a day. It's entirely possible. I mean, naturally because you're ill, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you're feeling, you know, immediately to want news of him. (pause) Do you think that this M. M. would try to cause any trouble in the future? Or is he so useless that he won't do that even?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has taken power of attorney from his mother. I think whatever money is going to his mother...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He uses. He can control. But apart from that, he can't do much more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But one thing is that the account which is..., the money is going into for his mother, is operated jointly by Vrindavan. So I think that's a safeguard. And now with this amendment, if they don't use the money properly, they won't get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they'll have to use it properly. So I'd better continue to write some of these letters, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That way I can get him to expedite his business. I'll be in the next room, in the office. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is going on right now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, not too much. I was just writing some notes down. I finished my correspondence. Others are chanting <span class="Italic">japa,</span> doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not so far, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Śatadhanya Mahārāja got information that they have left for Delhi on the plane at about noontime, which means they would have arrived about three o'clock in Delhi. So it's now 6:30, 6:25, which would mean that they should be here very shortly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have arrived?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, if they got on the plane they should have arrived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the time now? About 6:25. Do you think you passed stool again, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Upendra is checking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is going on outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Ārati</span> just... Nanda-kumāra just came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> I can't see what is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Upendra couldn't tell. Are you feeling tired still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not bringing the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he hasn't come yet, no, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I think that if he comes any moment, it will have been very, very quick that he came. I mean actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If not, so that means hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let us wait, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because he should be here very shortly. I mean it's actually miraculous how quickly everything was done, how we were able to call Calcutta in the middle of the night, how Adri-dhāraṇa was able to get the man and bring him on a train..., plane by noontime, how we again were able to reach Calcutta on the telephone and get this information. So far, it appears that everything is very quickly being done. So we just have to be a little... You know. We have to be a little bit patient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think I shall die very quickly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think I shall die very quick?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I don't think you shall die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I wanted that <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> last night, so he was not possible?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> from Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You wanted him? So he's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he's coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's supposed to be here any moment, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (whispering) Hm. I'll check my schedule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caru Mahārāja suggested that they may have taken the hopping flight from Calcutta, which stops in about three different places. I can just see my airline... I don't have an up-to-date airline schedule, but even the one I have might indicate the afternoon flight. Shall I see it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, not really, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's not all theory. We spoke with the man. He went out and got the <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> When we again called Calcutta we were informed that they had left on the plane. I mean there's no reason to suspect that people are lying to us, our own Godbrothers are lying to us. I mean it's so close to the time when they should arrive that we shouldn't become discouraged. I mean right now we could send Śatadhanya Mahārāja to Calcutta, but it would be very bad to do that, because the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> may be five miles out of Vṛndāvana right now. Or he may have just reached Delhi if he came on this propeller plane. We have every reason to believe that he'll be here at any moment. We have no reason to feel that he shouldn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He's definitely in transit, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's nothing at all to lead us to feel dismayed that they haven't..., he hasn't... For example... I mean we got the call through to Calcutta by 2:30, and they said that he got the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> and they got on the plane and left. That's very, very positive information. I mean, imagine if someone had picked up the phone in Calcutta and said, "I don't know," or "He couldn't find the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>." But they said, "He got the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> and they got on the plane." That's very, very positive information. Maybe we should read a little bit. That will be a good diversion now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you'll read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, the other night... I mean we could read <span class="Italic">SB..</span> I'm always eager for you to hear <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> I mean, I wanted to call... I always like to call Pradyumna and Jayādvaita. Of course, that requires... If you wanted to translate, you could make the effort. Otherwise Jayādvaita could read some of the edited work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He went to Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says that Jayādvaita went to Delhi today. Why? (quietly) Irresponsible. He goes. He didn't even tell me. [break] ...read <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali with Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have not given him letters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The necessary letters, you have not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, he won't be able... The letter will be signed by Girirāja and then sent to you. But the necessary other things I will give you. All the necessary things will be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you give him? Why...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm? Give him right now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is the use of its sitting here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of his sitting here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of its sitting here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I can give him just now. Shall I bring? I have it in my almirah. I was going to give it to him tomorrow after I showed him the letter and explained everything. I've dictated a letter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if he has got business, why he should remain here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I also felt that he should expedite his journey. He should go as soon as possible. Actually I have everything that I need to give him I can give him right now-the letter which will be sent to the bank, and I'll be sending...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to return as quickly as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I personally felt you could go tomorrow even, 'cause I thought that you could actually... I think the earlier you get back to Calcutta the better. But his idea was to leave Sunday, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Sunday, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Today is Friday. So he wanted to leave the day after tomorrow. Otherwise everything is ready for him to go whenever he wants it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Where is the certificates?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I bring them? The certificates are with the bank, but we have the counterfoil identity slips.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give him. Let him go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I said now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I turn on a light, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the certificates are lying with the bank. And I'm writing a letter to the bank informing them to take collection...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give me... Straight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Make Prabhupāda straight. He wants to be up straight. Lift that leg up on the pillow. Okay, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Lift him from the center. It's not so much from here; it's there. That's it. (to Vrindavan:) So the certificates are lying with the bank, and I've written them a letter that they should take collection, the bank should take collection from the post office directly, and that after taking collection, the full amount of money should be transferred to your account, Vrinda Book Company, care of United Bank. We're making the payment to his company, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The account number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He didn't have the account number, but he has the name of the account and the ledger page and the bank and the address of the bank, which I think is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> That is enough, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Actually, even without the account number, if you have the name of the account it sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Name, "Number 11," that's enough for account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So, then I've also informed them in the letter that the proprietor of the company-and I mentioned your name-that we have given you the counterfoil identity slips and also that we have given you the receipt for the safe custody. These certificates were kept in safe custody, so we're giving you the receipt, because it says that in order for these... Of course the bank can do everything, but you can deliver these identity slips and the safe custody receipt to the bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> To my banker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, not to your banker. To Prabhupāda's bank, the Bank of Baroda. Then I also mentioned that I am enclosing a copy of the power of attorney, that "Prabhupāda has been ill so he has difficulty in signing and he has duly empowered the following two persons." And that power of attorney will also be sent to them. So I'm also going to write a letter to Chandra requesting him to give Vrindavan help, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he will carry all these letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what he's going to do... Today I'm giving you... And I explained to Vrindavan, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that originally these receipts, these postal receipts, were meant for all of the five former family members, but as he's doing business now and he requires some money, that Your Divine Grace is giving him this money as a good chance. And I said that he should utilize it to develop the business. And in the future, when there is sufficient money, he may pay to the individuals the amount that they would have gotten from these postal receipts. But first of all use it and develop the business. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be success...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So these are the receipts. They're not actually the certificates themselves, but they're... As you can see, it's called an identity slip. I'll just take one and read it to you. As it's mentioned... It's mentioned on the N.B., on the back side. "N.B. This slip may not be surrendered to the post office when the holder discharges only some of the certificates held by him, but must be handed over when all the certificates detailed in the slip have been cashed." So the bank will want these. You can hand them over, you take a receipt from them, that "These were given by Vrindavan-candra De to you," like that. That's when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Shall I give it to my banker? This? Or to Bank of Baroda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. You give it to Bank of Baroda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> In Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You give it to Bank of Baroda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take Chandra with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take Chandra. Really, you should take his help for the whole thing. He can definitely be of help. Now, the other thing I'm giving you is the receipt for safe custody. Actually, because we're doing everything through the bank, neither of these are actually required. But it will be further proof of your bona fide by showing here you are with these things. Then obviously you're the correct person. It just further identifies you. Otherwise how could you get these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> I should give them to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, you can give them... They may not even ask for them, but you can show them: "I have these. Do you require them?" If they say yes, then you take a receipt from them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Then I should be duly authorized to hand over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's already in the letter. The letter authorizes you that you are having these. That's pretty much all we could give him at this time, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The letter will be going to the bank, with a copy sent to him at his business address. And that should be coming to you, I would think, by the 4th, something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> Fourth. I shall be in Calcutta at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But in the meantime, on Monday, you should approach your bankers and explain to them that you're going to have fifty thousand rupees, and against this you want a further loan of fifty thousand rupees against the bill, which you can show them. And if they require it, you can arrange for the person who's paying to make direct payment to them, including interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vrindavan De:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> To my banker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then how can they object? You see? Especially because the person is the government of India. If it were another party, they might say, "Well, we want some guarantee." But no one will ask for guarantee from the National Library. So like that, you can make a nice arrangement. And we figured out, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he's going to make about twelve to fifteen thousand... (end)</div>
