<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...purport of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Divā vyartha-karmabhiḥ. Karmabhiḥ. Divā ca vyartha-karmabhiḥ [SB 1.16.9].</span> [break] That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Oh, that... There is... Let's see. 1968, nineteen sixty..., 1970 there was a lot of rain. But I've never seen it rain four days in a row like this, just all day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I don't ever recall it raining so long in succession. Last year it didn't rain very much at all. Very little rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Last year all over the world there was drought. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> ...and they had some temples there in Rio Janeiro and San Pablo, and they were followers of Gaurasundara and Siddha-svarūpa. And I think they're still there. And when I was there they were making <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>, and they were chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the middle of their <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>, they would stop their <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>, and they would chant <span class="Italic">"Jaya jaya</span> Siddha-svarūpa," and <span class="Italic">"Jaya jaya</span> Gaurasundara." So I could not do anything. I told them it was all wrong and everything, and uh... But there is many, many innocent people who are following. They go there for the first time and they make them chant <span class="Italic">"Jaya jaya</span> Siddha-svarūpa" and <span class="Italic">"Jaya jaya</span> Gaurasundara," like this. So we were telling, we were talking with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no harm in giving <span class="Italic">"jaya"</span> to Vaiṣṇavas provided they follow the Vaiṣṇava principles. Otherwise, to glorify Vaiṣṇava is not bad. (pause) No, no <span class="Italic">"jaya"</span> to Mahāprabhu, Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu? They chanted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Were they chanting, <span class="Italic">"Jaya</span> Lord Caitanya, Nityānanda Prabhu?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Yes, they also chanting, <span class="Italic">"Bhaja śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya.</span>" Yes. But the point is that they were chanting the name of Siddha-svarūpa Gosvāmī and Gaurasundara Gosvāmī, uh, Gaurasundara Adhikārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one is Vaiṣṇava, then to glorify him is..., that's not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> So that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> As long as that Vaiṣṇava is following the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they should not attempt like that in the presence of their spiritual master. That is not good. When you found this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> When did you find they were doing this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> When I was there. I was in Brazil about three months ago. And the only books they had published is a book written by Siddha-svarūpa Gosvāmī. They had published one book of him, and they were distributing this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the name of that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> It was an introduction to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, question and answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. I have give to Karandhara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is there anything awkward against our devotional life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I can't read it. It's in Portuguese.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it was in Portuguese language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Yes, it's in Portuguese. The only, the only point is that he quotes in this book, he quotes more the books of Gaurasundara than your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Gaurasundara has written some books, and so Siddha-svarūpa, answering the question, quotes from the book of Gaurasundara, and he mentioned, "My professor, Gaurasundara, taught me," and he quotes many, many time. Practically more from the book of Gaurasundara than from your books. (end)</div>
