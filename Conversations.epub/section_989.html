<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grapes, apple. Where is your eldest child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> This is Candramukhī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I saw you in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got two or three girls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> Just two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two. Is there arrangement for preparing <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> with green peas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> With <span class="Italic">mung?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> With green peas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> With green peas. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make little <span class="Italic">khicuḍi</span> and curry and okra vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> All right. We have <span class="Italic">chaturi</span> (?)and <span class="Italic">parāṭā.</span> You want that also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have already made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nandarāṇī:</span> But I can make <span class="Italic">khicuḍi,</span> that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I'll take also little <span class="Italic">parāṭā.</span> Where is bathroom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> There's another room for resting. And you can go out this door, this here, and bathroom is on the other side of this resting room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Let me show you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the key to this cabinet, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I put the bag in it. [break]... very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a rented house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The rent now it is twelve hundred dollars. But of course everything is now much more expensive. So I was negotiating in New York for better arrangements, because in Iran price is going up and up and up. And I told my company that they should buy one house. And they have agreed. So there is going to be that house, we will buy something like this for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And also we have saved some money, we'll buy a temple also in addition to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is very nice. Dayānanda, do you like it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice place, private, everything is so nice. In winter, what is the temperature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Yes, it snows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Like Vṛndāvana. Isn't it like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> It's colder than Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It doesn't snow in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vṛndāvana I don't think less than fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It sometimes gets colder, I think. Nowadays anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Here it gets ten, fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no snow in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> We have plenty of snow here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> We're very high, we're six thousand feet above sea level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We've got everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Has it come in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just Harikeśa and myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So everything is clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The luggage and everything is here. I'll go now and see to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am also very happy, Dayānanda, you are here, and you can have more facilities. You family men, you require some money also. So your present situation is very nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they are paying you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> They are paying, I bring home about one thousand dollars per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After deducting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> After deducting taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is better than USA. You were getting six hundred there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are getting more? Why Gargamuni advised you to give up? I chastised him, "Why you have given him such advice? He's a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he must have some money. He has to take care of the children." Anyway, you have got better job now and better service also. Kṛṣṇa has awarded you for your service. Stick to it. Don't... If you like to serve here, you can be permanently settled. No, what is their rules?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> It is quite easy, because they need foreigners to come and work here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is very, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> So they give visas very easily for working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Especially to Americans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very good opportunity. Bring more Americans and start this movement nicely. Not necessarily that we have to establish a temple. We want to preach our philosophy. That is most important. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-mārga.</span> There are two ways, <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga</span> and <span class="Italic">pāñcarātriki.</span> The <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga</span> is more important than <span class="Italic">pāñcarātriki. Pāñcarātriki</span> is Deity worship. So do you meet many intelligent men here? No. Not very.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Some intelligent. People are working very hard for money, and they're very materialistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere in the eastern part of the world. They are after money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> And the foreigners who come here also, they are materialistic also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere materialistic. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> Spiritualistic means <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> perfection. Who cares for perfection? Bring money and enjoy. That's all. Who cares for perfection? They do not know what is perfection. They think that you get money, you live comfortably as far as possible, and after death, everything's finished. Is it not? This is the philosophy. Who cares to know that there is life after death and better life, better planet, better world? This is not at all good, it is full of miseries. They are driving all day, car, but they do not think it is tiresome. They think it is pleasure. To have a car and drive whole day, they do not feel that is tiresome. They think "I have got a car, I'm driving, people are seeing. It is pleasure."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> It is madness, how they can enjoy a city like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we do not deprecate. We simply say that do whatever you like, but do not forget your real business, self-realization, <span class="Italic">ātma-tattvam.</span> Self-realization, that is required. And if we live like cats and dogs and again become cats and dogs and pigs, that is not success. But there is chance if one does not know <span class="Italic">ātma-tattva.</span> Nature's law will work. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-yoni-janmasu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So, your son is sleeping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, this is not my son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is salt, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This is watermelon, this is a different kind of melon. You prefer it here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is local product?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take some?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, please, please, Śrīla Prabhupāda. If you like little salt on it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Can I have the key? To lock up the passports and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is a drink, Śrīla Prabhupāda, made of some melon, different melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also local?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, that is very local. Is that sweet, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> It can become very sweet. Sometimes it is very, very sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. So, very nice. Like <span class="Italic">bael.</span> In India, like <span class="Italic">bael.</span> So nice fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Can I serve the devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. It is so nice. You can distribute this also. All the devotees. Do they eat meat very much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Yes, they are learning. Before ten years ago, they were, everyone was very good Muslim, and they would eat a little bit of sheep. But today they are learning the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> Beef. Because they think the more they are like Americans, the better they are. But they have so many fruits and vegetables here, the land gives them so many wonderful things, but they think that they must eat meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> There is an old poem, an old epic poem that we were told about that states that many thousands of years ago the Iranians were all vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Āryan culture. Iranian means Āryan. It is a <span class="Italic">apabhraṁśa</span> of <span class="Italic">Ārya, Iraya.</span>(?) And they are called Parsis. Parsis still, those who fled away from this place, they are just like Hindus. They have got sacred thread. In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> They keep a sacred fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still there are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> A few, a few temples here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are fire worshipers, Sūrya. (indistinct) Their marriage ceremony is just like Hindus. (to someone else) <span class="Italic">Namaskāra,</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> The language is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have taken <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> The whole language here is very similar to Sanskrit, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can read this also. This is in Sanskrit. (to Iranian student:) You understand English? Very good. Your country is very nice. So nice food, fruits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> Nice to meet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly, from Kashmir to central Asia, it was known as <span class="Italic">Bhū-svarga,</span> especially Kashmir, <span class="Italic">Bhū-svarga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Heaven on earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, heaven on the earthly planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Parivrājakācārya:</span> We noticed that in one of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams</span> you mentioned that Kardama Muni had his <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> Kaśyapa Muni I mean, on the shore of the Caspian Sea, which is just an hour from here by plane-it's ninety kilometers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, Caspian Sea. This is made from a kind of fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Yes, a kind of melon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are saying that the moon is full of dust. And dust is so brilliant? We have to believe this? The rascals they are making this proposal. So what do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> I don't think they know actually what they are talking about, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, actually this is fact. It is similar planet like the sun, but it is surrounded by cold atmosphere, therefore it is so pleasing. And because it is far away from the sun, the distance between moon and earth is more than the distance between the sun and the earth. Therefore sun looks bigger and it looks smaller. We are contemplating having a planetarium with electric arrangement. You'll have to work. The whole planetary system is moving from east to west, and the sun, moon and... They are up and down. (to child): Come on, Hare Kṛṣṇa, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. He can speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, just a few words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. You have got any fruit tree in the garden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Some pear trees, some apple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Peach? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> No. We used to have a cherry tree, but it died. We also have a pomegranate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good pomegranate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These boys, do they inquire about something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. Hussain Prabhu has been coming here for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring some spittoon. You can keep it here. They understand English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They understand English, yes, some English. Hussain Prabhu has been coming here for a few months. He's chanting. He's a very, very pious boy. Before he came here, he was chanting names of God and following the four regulations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Very nice. And he is coming recently. He's also interested. He is a vegetarian, does not eat meat, and he's following the four regulations, and he's starting to chant now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He's been coming for two, three months. He's chanting sixteen rounds, and as I said, before he came here, he was chanting various names of God as they are prescribed in Koran. And when he saw that we were chanting names of God, he immediately became attracted. He said, "This is right." Because he knows also that from Koran he should chant the names of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. In the Koran chanting is recommended?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The more you chant God's name, your heart becomes cleansed. (Ātreya Ṛṣi translates) <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> So God has many names. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended God's name must be... It doesn't matter the language is different. <span class="Italic">Nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktiḥ.</span> In each name the full power of God is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Hussain Prabhu says that his goal in life is to translate your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, he's a very, very sincere boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it immediately. Somebody, some Arabian student made some translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, there was some translations of <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is, that boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Into Arabic. He's in Europe. He is a Palestinian boy. Hussain is asking how should this translation be done, what is your recommendation, if you have any suggestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, I am not well versed in your language, but you simply, if you understand that English and translate it into Parsi, that will do. As it is, you translate. Don't make any change. Then it will be all right. And when there is difficulty, you can ask Ātreya Ṛṣi. Harikeśa. Where is Harikeśa? Where he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nava-yauvana:</span> Moustafa asked a question, how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness in this country. It seems difficult to him, because the people's reaction... It's very foreign, the outward appearance of devotees is very strange to them. He wants to know how this philosophy can be spread here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The first thing is that what do you mean by Kṛṣṇa. That is to be understood. Kṛṣṇa means God. So if you have no objection to chant the name of God, then there is no difference of opinions. Now first of all, I may ask you, "What do you mean by God?" You are chanting the holy name of God, and people may ask you, "What do you mean by God?" Because especially nowadays... (aside) No, there is matches? That's all. Come near. So first question will be, "What do you mean by God?" If I, or anybody, asks you, "What do you mean by God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> I cannot explain, because now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that you must explain. If you are chanting the name of God, then you must know what do you mean by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> When I feel, I will get spiritual, my feeling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual, what do you mean by spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> It means I put everything that is bad and dirty inside and I make it out, all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is inside and what is outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> Outside? I don't know what is inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you do not know. You do not know outside, inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> When I do wrong, for example. When I do lie, when I do something, when I see wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wrong, one thing is wrong in my country, and that is right in your country. Just like animal slaughter is wrong according to our Vedic civilization. Unnecessary animal slaughter is forbidden. But in your country or in other Western countries, they kill so many animals. So what is wrong, what is right? Who will decide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Moustafa:</span> That's the reason I don't kill animals and I don't eat meat. For three years now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very good, very good idea. When we want God, to understand, we must try to understand what is God. What do you mean by God? The God definition is given in the dictionary, what is that? "Supreme being, supreme controller." So how do you understand that supreme controller? What do you mean by supreme controller? In this way we should try to understand what is the idea carried by the word God. We have got, in our Vedic language, we have got definition of God, that</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"God" means He must possess all the wealth. Just like in Persia you have got so many wealthy persons, but nobody can claim, even the Shah cannot claim, that he possesses all the wealth. That is not possible. Persia. Do you follow what I say? So this is one of the items, that God is the richest, or He possesses all the wealth. Similarly, He possesses all the strength, He possesses all the beauty, He possesses all knowledge, and He is the renouncer also, the most exalted renouncer. Although He possesses so many things, He is renounced. Just like this universe is the property of God, but He has given to you, all the living entities. "Now you wanted to enjoy, enjoy it to your best capacity." He doesn't interfere. "All right, you go on." And we are trying to enjoy this material world to our best capacity. Just like in Iran, you are trying to enjoy by exploiting the oil. Similarly, somebody is exploiting. It is all God's property. He doesn't interfere. "All right, enjoy." This is renouncement. His property, He does not come to interfere. God knows how this universe is made. So many big, big scientists, they are trying to understand what is the constitution, how this universe is made, how it is created. Nobody knows, but He knows. Just like you have got this body, I have got this body, but we do not know everything of this body. I do not know how many hairs are there. Is it not? So, so many things. I am eating, and it is transformed into blood, and it is directed towards brain, towards other parts of the body and we are working very strong, but we do not know how things are happening. Although I am claiming I am this body, I am my body. But God knows every particular, any... <span class="Italic">anvayād itarataḥ.</span> How the stone is made, He knows. How this flower is colored, He knows. That is called wise, wisdom. <span class="Italic">Vedāhaṁ samatītāni</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He knows. That is God. He is the possessor of all wealth, all knowledge, all beauty, all strength, all influence. In this way you have to understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> His question is "How can I have more faith in God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The more you know about these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> You must inquire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, very good. Then is bigger than you. Very good. There is a verse in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, siddhānta baliyā citte nā kara alasa ihā ha-ite kṛṣṇe</span> [<span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 2.117]. To know, we have got limited knowledge, we cannot understand full what is God, but still we must try to understand what is God. This is the general definition of God. Suppose you take one item, God is rich, richest. Try to understand how He is richest, what is the topmost idea of all richness. Whether God possesses that richness. He possesses, but we do not understand. In this way we have to study, and all the saintly person have studied Kṛṣṇa, about these six things. They have analyzed the characters and symptoms and they have found <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not blindly, but studying thoroughly about these qualities of God, they have decided <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you have to study God. Not that we accept God anybody and anything, no. <span class="Italic">Siddhānta baliyā citte nā kara alasa</span>. Don't be lazy to understand God. The more you understand, the more you become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He says, "I am very anxious to become a good devotee."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I suppose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Of course. We know the President of Air India in Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's on Iran Air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Iran Air also, no problem. You'll get the best flight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very good climate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you must rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Last year when we were in Denver, I think you were very healthy there, and this is the same altitude.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then we can stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll go down and see how the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is coming along. They've brought the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> up now?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're just cleaning it out. They're giving you the big bathroom because it has a Western toilet and a nice shower and separate everything, it's very nice, and we'll use the small one. They're just cleaning it now, if you want you can use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lock this door, otherwise if you come there, it will be disturbance.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I heard you like it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The more you become eager to know God, God will reveal Himself. From our side, we should not be stereotyped. People in different sects of religion, they say, "We believe." But they do not want to go further than they believe. That is very difficult. You must be dynamic and progressive, then you will have. I have talked with many sects, especially Christian priests. They will say "We believe," no more further than that. So knowledge is not like that. Knowledge must be progressive. "We believe there is no soul of the animal"-<span class="Italic">bas,</span> fixed up. You believe like a rascal, so I shall remain rascal. What is this? We should be progressive. That is wanted. Of course, in the lower stage one may have a type of belief, but if you want more clearly, you must be progressive. According to Vedānta system, the life, human life, is only for inquiring about Brahman. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> We shall talk again.</div>
