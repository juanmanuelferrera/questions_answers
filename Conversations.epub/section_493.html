<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> I would like to ask you why we are so fortunate to have such a nice genuine spiritual master as you, and some others have bogus spiritual master. Is it something of <span class="Italic">karma</span> or is this the pure mercy of yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you can think-your spiritual master is nice, others bogus-but they do not think like that. (laughter) They will think their spiritual master is good, your spiritual master is bogus. But there is standard who is spiritual master. Spiritual master means who is the best servant of God. One who does not agree the existence of God, he is bogus because he's not bona fide, <span class="Italic">mūḍhā.</span> One who does not accept the existence of God, he is <span class="Italic">mūḍhā.</span> He's a rascal. He cannot... A rascal cannot become spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> How come we come to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is another thing, but first of all we have to know who is spiritual master. The spiritual master is he, <span class="Italic">samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> one who is exclusively servant of God, he is spiritual master. Otherwise anyone will come and say, "I am spiritual master." Anyone will come say, "I am incarnation of God." So there is standard. That we have to find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Most of the people are still ignoring God. They are so weak-willed. They are so weak-willed that they are easily swayed by, you know, when somebody comes and claims that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if one is weak, he may be infected by some disease. It requires some resisting power. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu said that, your answer, that "Only the fortunate person, they can get the shelter of bona fide spiritual master." <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān jīva.</span> Not all, <span class="Italic">kona. Kona</span> means some.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span>. Some, yes. <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jīva.</span> So as there are <span class="Italic">bhagavān-</span>somebody is rich, somebody is poor; this is also due to fortune or misfortune-similarly, if one is spiritually fortunate he gets a bona fide spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Do you have any opinions about some of the other Indian masters who have been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already said, that unless one is bona fide servant of God, he cannot become master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I mean specific people like Guru Maharaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Guru Maharaji says that he is God himself. Then he's a bogus. How he can be God? God is so cheap? So only the foolish person will accept him. Those who have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Maharshi Mahesh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think he doesn't speak anything about God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No. He's teaching the transcendental meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He speaks something of material prosperity. So He has nothing to do with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's just a kind of training of mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Just like gymnastic. You exercise; you become bodily strong. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Sai Baba?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sai Baba, he also says, "I am Bhagavān." Therefore he's bogus. How you can say yourself that you are Bhagavān, God? What is your power? What you have shown? And this is cheap. Now, supposing Sai Baba is God. So people accept him God, why? Because he shows some jugglery. He creates little gold. Is it not? So if, by creating gold, he is God, then there is bigger God who has created gold mine. Why shall I go to this tiny god? I must go to the big God who has created gold mine. This is common sense. But foolish people, they have no common sense even. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">mūḍhā. Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Tribhir guṇamayair bhāvair mohita, mūḍhā nābhijānāti.</span> Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like mostly people take: "The nature is all in all." The scientist, they take nature. But nature is matter. So where is our experience-the matter is working automatically? Where is our experience? Hm? Matter... Does matter work automatically? What is your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> It's a chain of reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reaction. First of all there must be beginning of action, then reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> In the beginning there's Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is... I think Newton or some scientist also said that "Original motion is given by somebody; then other motions are given." Just like this, what is called? Railway wagons? So one engine pushes it. Then the wagon, another wagon, (makes sound) "cutcutcutcutcut," like that. Wherefrom the original? That is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The <span class="Italic">Vedānta... Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> The motion... Wherefrom the original motion comes? That is Brahmān, Parabrahmān. <span class="Italic">Aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said, (sic:) <span class="Italic">aham as amāgre.</span> So they have no eyes to see wherefrom the original motion comes. <span class="Italic">Bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the statement. <span class="Italic">Bīja.</span> Now, this flower has come, white flower, from the particular seed. If there are several seeds you sow, the one seed will come rose flower, another seed will come this flower, another seed... Why? Why not the same? Who has made this variety?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> Recently I was reading article in a science magazine and a space scientist, he has calculated that after 67,000 million years the universe contracts. And then I started calculating in terms of the <span class="Italic">yugas</span> and the division which is mentioned. With the help of an astronomer I reached the conclusion that both figures coincide. So do you mean to say that when it was mentioned that after four <span class="Italic">yugas</span> they will collide. Then it was a kind of vision, or might have been calculated by this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means calculation. It is going on, regulated way. Just like everyone knows that this month is February. In the month of June the summer will begin. Everyone knows. It is not conclusion; it is experience. There is no need of calculating. So one who has got better experience, he can say like that. Calculation and experience. Just like if somebody says, "Two plus two plus two plus two," somebody says immediately, "Six." And another calculates, "Two plus two plus..., six." So experience and calculation. Lacks experience, he calculates. One who has better experience, he doesn't calculate. One who knows past, present, and future, he doesn't require to make calculation. He knows everything. So God knows past, present, and future, and others who are favored by God, he also knows by the grace of God. Because he hears from God. God knows past, present, and future. Then he simply reproduces God's words, that's all. He doesn't require to calculate. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">sahasra-yuga-paryantam ahar yad brahmaṇo viduḥ [Bg. </span>8.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> The Kṛṣṇa says. Now, we can say what is the age of Brahmā by Kṛṣṇa's words. I don't require to be a very expert astrologer or astronomer. I hear from Kṛṣṇa, and I reproduce. Just like child. Father said, "This is this;" I say, "This is this." That's all. The child is not perfect, but when he says, "Father said this is this," that is perfect. Therefore our process of gathering knowledge from the father-we don't calculate or don't concoct or put theories, no. We don't do that. This is called <span class="Italic">śruti, śruti-pramāṇa,</span> evidence from <span class="Italic">śruti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> that, to Arjuna, that when Sūrya is <span class="Italic">uttarāyana,</span> people who die, they'll go to Candraloka, and come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you quote that. Then it is perfect. You don't require to make research. Your research is no good because your senses are imperfect. I have no proper vision. If the light is stopped, I cannot see. This is the position of my eyes. So what is the use of my seeing? It is conditional. So one who is conditional, how he can give perfect knowledge? One who is not conditional, he can give perfect knowledge. Therefore we have to approach somebody who is not conditioned. Then we get perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I have great difficulty with the meaning of the term "perfect knowledge." Could you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect knowledge means what you say, it is correct. There is no mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Under any and all circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is perfect knowledge, not like the scientists. They changes: "Yes, it was this. Now it is now changed." This is not perfect knowledge. They simply change. Therefore we say, <span class="Italic">mūḍhās.</span> Perfect knowledge is that what you say, that is correct forever. That is perfect. Just like man dies. If somebody says, "Man dies," it is perfect knowledge. It is correct forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Suppose he is reincarnated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, "dies" means the body dies. The soul does not die. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the body annihilates... Body becomes old. Just like this cloth. I am using it, but when it will be old, no more useful, then I throw it away. I get another dress. This body is like that. Soul is eternal. <span class="Italic">Na jāyate na mriyate vā kadācit.</span> It does not die, it does not take birth, but because he is in material condition, therefore he has to change the material body because no material thing is permanent. Therefore the aim of life should be how to avoid this material body. That is real business. <span class="Italic">Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.</span> That is called <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is only business, how to stop acceptance of this material body. And that is very clearly and simply stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, janma karma me divyaṁ yo janāti tattvataḥ, tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> We can do that. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, that you try to understand Kṛṣṇa, then you are not going to accept any more material body. That means there is no more birth, no more death, no more disease, no more, and what is called, old age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But is it possible to lead the life of a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and at the same time think of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Arjuna was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and a king and a politician. If he could learn within half an hour the aim of life, then where is the difficulty for a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha?</span> Arjuna was not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So it was spoken to him only, and Kṛṣṇa selected that "You are the right person." So there is no question of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha, sannyāsī.</span> The person must be right to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Is it possible to develop some such kind of psyche?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Arjuna was not willing to fight. Then he developed; "Yes, I must fight for Kṛṣṇa." That is development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So there is no conflict between the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gṛhastha</span> is also <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> It is as good as <span class="Italic">sannyāsa āśrama.</span> You can accept any <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> suitable for you, but <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> means cultivation of spiritual knowledge. That is the difference between <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> and ordinary house. Now, this building is called temple, and the next building is called house. Why? The building is the same. But it is meant for cultivating spiritual knowledge. Therefore it is called temple, to understand God. The other house is meant for eating, sleeping, mating and defending. Therefore they are house. So you can change your house into temple provided you try to understand God. Then it is <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> Otherwise it is house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But is it possible to jump from <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> to directly <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not jumping. It is regular process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> One should go through all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like student. Then he becomes a family man when he's grown up. Then he becomes again a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So it is a process. It is not jumping. One after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, but would you allow one of the devotees to, if he wants to, observe celibacy and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> And after that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After that, he should continue the life of celibacy. But if he is unable, then he's allowed to marry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Because (Sanskrit). You cannot suppress your <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of supressing. Regulating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Do the same rules apply to women as to men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that in the society women, working class, and the mercantile class, they are, according to Vedic scripture, they are less intelligent, women, working class and mercantile men. Just like mercant..., they are after money, that's all. And <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> they want, after job. And women means they are after fulfilling their material desires. They have no other idea, that there is Brahmān, one should know Brahmān... They do not care to know. Therefore they are called <span class="Italic">śūdras, stri, śūdra, vaiśya.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vaiśya.</span> So Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br class="calibre2"/>ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br class="calibre2"/>te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 9.32]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So it is not blocked for anyone. Anyone can get Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Anyone can go back to home, back to Godhead, provided you follow the regulative principle. Then it is possible for everyone. It doesn't matter whether he's woman, whether he's working class, whether he's a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> It doesn't matter. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that "Even they can go. And what to speak of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas?" Kiṁ punar brāhmaṇāḥ puṇyā bhaktā rājarṣayaḥ...</span> [Bg. 9.33]. If the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they cultivate spiritual knowledge, it becomes very easy for them. Even they can go, <span class="Italic">śūdras, stri, vaiśya.</span> These are all the statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Can a woman become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why <span class="Italic">sannyāsī?</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not say to become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He said, "One who takes shelter of Me very firmly..." We have to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. You become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī-</span>it doesn't matter. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> He never says that "You become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" He never said. The qualification is how to become firmly fixed up at the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is qualification. But <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is a process. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha-</span>that is a process. But one who takes directly shelter of Kṛṣṇa is above all these processes.</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Those who are pure devotees<span class="Italic">-avyabhicāreṇi, anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">-</span>such persons are above this material infection. So therefore he doesn't require to accept <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> He doesn't... These are gradual processes, to come to the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system, then accept the <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśramas, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system. But this is the beginning of human life. One who does not take to this system, he's animal because animal, there is no such system. And because in this age the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> is not observed, therefore men are like animals. <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa hīnā paṣubhiḥ samānāḥ. Dharma</span> means this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma. Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if the human society does not accept <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> then he's as good as animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That which Śrīla Gandhi was working against?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I say the truth you'll be angry. (chuckling)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, no one will be angry, but you have mentioned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi was a politician. What does he know about <span class="Italic">dharma?</span> He was a politician. He thought it wise that British government is very strong... Before him so many political parties tried to become violent, and they were all curbed down. This Aurobindo also was a leader of anarchist party, and when he was condemned to death, then his senses came: "This is all useless. Let me engage in performing yoga." So Gandhi thought that before him all these violent movement was cast down by the British. So he took it as a method, nonviolence, noncooperation, and to capture the public of India-India is generally inclined religiously-he became a <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> But <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is different. A <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is not interested in politics. <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ-prakṛtim āśritāḥ, bhajanty ananya-manaso [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">mahātmā. Mahātmā</span> has nothing to do with politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> The term <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> was first used to describe Gandhi by Annie Besant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, one can use any term without any sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No, I think it was by Rabindranath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... Anyone can. Rabindra Bābu was also like that. (laughter) He was a <span class="Italic">bābu,</span> but he became guru. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That means that about this <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara</span> etc-Lord Kṛṣṇa mentions in <span class="Italic">Gītā-</span>that this present day society is <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa-saṅkara.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama;</span> therefore all the children, they are <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span> And as soon as there is <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara</span> population, the world becomes hell. Therefore we are trying to check-"No illicit sex"-to stop this <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span> Now the <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara</span> has come to such an extent that they are killing child, and that is legal. They have come down to such a extreme position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But surely there is a practical point of view also. There is nothing to eat. What will happen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says nothing to eat? That is also their manufacture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I mean the figures which are published that half of humanity will starve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It's... Especially, we are Indian. It is advertised that we are poverty-stricken. All over the world this is advertised. Wherever I go, they say, "Oh, you are coming from India?" (laughter) Because they are simply begging, the government. But who is dying? There is... Dying is going on, but that death is going on in other countries also. They are dying, committing suicide. And maybe some persons are dying out of starvation. You cannot stop death. Suppose you have got enough food. That means that everything is solved? In America there is enough food. Why they are coming hippies? There is no shortage of food. Nothing... Everything is abundant, but why they are becoming hippies? They are lying down on the street, on the park and I have seen in London, the St. James Park. They are sleeping, and the police is kicking: "Hey! Get up! Get up!" So why? The English nation is not poor nation. The American nation is not poor nation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Poverty is also a comparative term.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I saw in Amsterdam-simply full of hippies, lying down on the street, lying down in the park, no food, no shelter. It is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The hippies are not lying in the park because they lack food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must be wanting something. They are in need of something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But not necessarily food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One body is in need of food; another body is in need of something else. They're needy, everyone, needy. That you have to accept. I have seen in Los Angeles. I was walking in the Beverly Hills quarter. One hippie boy is coming from a very nice house. Beverly Hills, that quarter, is resided by all rich class. And he has got very nice car, but he's hippie. Why? His father is very rich man. He has got nice car. He might be very educated. Then why he is hippie? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> He's frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means in need. So that is the question, that you may be in need of food, I may be in need of some woman, he may be in need of some money... In this way everyone is needy. Therefore ultimately one should search after God, when every need will be fulfilled. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja, he went... He was in need of an empire like his father. For that reason he went to the forest and performed all kinds of austerities, and when he saw God he said, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛthārto 'smi varaṁ na yāce:</span> "I have no more need. Everything is fulfilled. I don't want anything." He... God said, "Now whatever benediction you want, you take from Me." He said, "No, I don't want anything. Now everything is fulfilled." So that is the real need. The child is crying, and he is not stopping crying. So many others coming. But as soon as his mother comes, he will stop. He understands immediately, "Now I have got the thing, my mother." So the real need is Kṛṣṇa. That is missing. Therefore this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. All these Western students, they were in need. Now they have got Kṛṣṇa. This young man, twenty-four years old, he has got all the desires for enjoyment, but he's no more after enjoyment. He's a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He's chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why? [break] ...playing jugglery? He becomes God. So even the so-called yogis, they are in need. The so-called <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they are in need. The so-called <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are also in need. Only the <span class="Italic">bhakta...</span> That Dhruva Mahārāja, he said, "No, I am not in need." <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42].</span> So therefore this is the only platform to bring man to feel completely fulfilled. So it is very important movement. So I request you all to study this movement and help and join this movement. It is very scientific, authentic, and real. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to be happy, you have to take Kṛṣṇa. Then you'll be happy. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> So <span class="Italic">dharma</span> there means to the religious faith or duty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is duty, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> That is also given up. That means the only duty becomes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He said, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> In the beginning He said that <span class="Italic">dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Yuge yuge sambhavāmi.</span> Now, He said that "I appear to reestablish the principle of religion." So at the last stage He said, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> That means the so-called <span class="Italic">dharmas,</span> or religion, which is going on in the world, they are not real. And the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> therefore says, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2], that "All kinds of pretending religion is rejected here." Pretending religion, what is that? Pretending... Just like gold. Gold is gold. If the gold is in the hand of some Hindu, then will it be called Hindu gold? Similarly, religion means obedience to God. So where is Hindu religion? Where is Christian religion? Where is Muslim religion? God is everywhere, and we are just meant for obeying God. That is one religion, obedience to God. Why they have manufactured this Hindu religion, Muslim religion, Christian religion, this religion, that...? Therefore they are all pretending religion. Real religion is obedient... <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like law. Law is made by the state. The law cannot be Hindu law, Muslim law, Christian law, this law, that law. Law is meant for everyone. Obedience to the state. That is law. Similarly, religion means obedience to God. Then one who has no conception of God, no idea of God, where is religion? That is pretending religion. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> you'll find, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra: [SB </span>1.1.2] "All pretending type of religion is rejected." And Kṛṣṇa also said the same thing, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "You give up all this pretending religion. You simply surrender unto Me. That is real religion." What is the use of speculating on pretending religion. That is not religion at all. Just like pretending law. Law cannot be pretending. Law is law, given by the state. Similarly, religion means the order given by God. That is religion. If you follow, then you are religious. If you don't follow, then you are demon. Make things very simplified. Then it will be appealing to everyone. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for making things very simplified. Accept God, accept your position as God's servant and serve God. That's all, three words. You have no question? These boys?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> They don't speak English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Oh, you don't understand English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> They're just amazed looking at you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They said they are simply here feeling your presence, and they realize that you're very busy, and so they are simply feeling love for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> (Spanish)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They said they have to go now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Everyone should be supplied with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What do you see as the future of your movement and are you planning to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My movement is genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...to choose a successor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already successful. Genuine thing is always success. Gold is gold. If somebody is fortunate, he can purchase gold, but gold remains gold. If somebody purchases and somebody does not, it doesn't matter. Gold is gold. So future, gold future is always the same as it is at present-if it is gold. If it is something glittering, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But there must be somebody, you know, needed to handle the thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we are creating. We are creating these devotees who will handle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> One thing he's saying, this gentleman, and I would like to know, is your successor named or your successor will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My success is always there. Yes. Just like the sun is there always. It may come before your vision or not. The sun is there. But if you are fortunate, you come before the sun. Otherwise you remain in darkness. Sun is open to everyone. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement-Kṛṣṇa is open to everyone. But if you are fortunate, you come to the light. If you are unfortunate, do not. That is your choice. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You do it. Now it is your choice. You surrender to Kṛṣṇa or don't surrender. That is your business. We are canvassing everyone, "Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and you'll be happy." Now it is their business to take it or not to take it. But he can come. He can ask question and then "How? Why shall I take it?" That we are ready, to convince him. That is preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> When you have come to United States, you had nothing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I came to give you. Some of you have taken, and some have not taken, so what can I do? I came to give you Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is my duty. My Guru Mahārāja ordered and I came. And... But some of you, you have taken, and most of, they have not taken. So that is another thing. But I came to deliver you the genuine thing. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> The way you have come is that you have come as though you've not come from a religion or nothing. You've come and everybody fall in love with you, you preach, and, Prabhupāda, we cannot deny you are the authority because you know everything, and your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any way you take it, then you become happy. That's all. Of course, when you take it out of love... That is a fact. So without love, this transaction, because there is no price for it... All other transaction, there is exchange of price. Here there is no price, so out of love only, one can take it, not by paying any price. It is not possible. To pay the price of Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not possible. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> You cannot force anybody to say, "I am the guru. I'm the (indistinct). Fall in love with me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I force? What is my... That is not my business. I am Kṛṣṇa's servant. I simply say, "Here is good thing. You take it." Now, Kṛṣṇa also says that. He does not force. Kṛṣṇa is God. He can force, but He does not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (6):</span> Good night now.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> How long you'll stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> About three more days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three more days. That is in his hand. First of all give here. (<span class="Italic">prasāda</span> being distributed) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Gītā, Kṛṣṇa, Caritāmṛta,</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> You have other texts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What do you recommend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span> We have translated it<span class="Italic">-Nectar of Devotion.</span> This in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This is in Sanskrit or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Bengali? No, but original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Apart from (indistinct) quality of Lord Rāma, are there a few other things which could be included while you are worshiping or devoting or meditating on...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God has all the qualities that you can conceive. It is generally not... <span class="Italic">Bhaga</span>(?), it is taken as six, six opulences. <span class="Italic">Bhaga</span> means opulence, and <span class="Italic">vān</span> means possessing. <span class="Italic">Bhagavat. Bhagavat-śabda. Bhaga</span> means opulence, and <span class="Italic">vat</span> means one who possesses. And the first word in <span class="Italic">bhagavat-śabda</span> is <span class="Italic">bhagavān.</span> This <span class="Italic">bhaga</span> means six kinds of opulences: riches, then fame, then bodily strength, influence, knowledge, beauty, and renunciation. These are opulences. If one is very rich, people are attracted. If one is very reputed, people are attracted. If one is very strong, people are attracted. Influential-attracted. If one is very beautiful, man or woman, he is also attractive. If one is very wise, he's attractive. And one who is renounced, he's also attra... So Kṛṣṇa has got all these qualification in full. That is the definition of God. Anyone who possesses all these qualities in fullness, not partially, that is God. This is the definition of God. Not that "I can produce one ounce of gold," but if he can produce all the mines of gold, he is God. Not cheap God. In that way everyone is God. (end)</div>
