<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> This is the neighborhood. It is a very rich neighborhood, Prabhupāda. Very wealthy. This is the most wealthy neighborhood, practically all of America. The builders are putting up houses all in here just like that house over there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They ever come to the Sunday feast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Some do. One man does. We've been here a short time, only four months. So we have to advertise more so people will come on the Sunday feast. But I think we will have thousands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. [break] ...trees very long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Just pine trees and oak trees. No fruit trees. [break] He was run over by a car, he was intoxicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What happened, he was not identified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> They said that he lived in these woods back here, way back in the woods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, drunkard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Yes. They had many cars here all day for two days. All the police, ambulance, TV.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To take photograph?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> To take photograph of the place. It became a monument. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to see a dead body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vṛṣākapi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Crows. (end)</div>
