<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (German Man):</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German) <span class="Italic">Beyond...</span> <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other planets.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> <span class="Italic">Topmost Yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is the... Yeah, the source of the Absolute. That is the best. But I read it twenty times, always with, in every day I find new things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> When I read other book, I read it one times, even not one time. But these books, I must read twenty times, and more even. It is, sometimes, it is, if I never read this book, it is so astonishing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get new light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I would say another thing what I was. When I met the knowledge of Omkarananda, yes, I went back quite a long, five kilometers, a farm, I retired in a farm. And then I made this meditation. And then I read the book and I read fifty pages in five minutes without reading that. And then when that was finished, I was in other worlds. I could speak about high, other fields, which never I had seen, but when, when I came back I didn't know what it was what I saw. In other words, it was not dream. Absolutely awake. Other worlds, and then other sciences, higher, and higher and higher. I don't know what it was, but it is no of signification, I believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It was not significant he says. He doesn't think, even though he experienced it, he doesn't think it's significant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (German) I would ask if in the Christian conscience if it gives anything which resembles to this, which is of some worth. Because in your books sometimes you speak of Jesus Christ. He also said: "What have we to do? We have to love God with all our heart and to serve Him." If it gives any movement in your knowledge in Western Europe or in the world in the Christian side one can read what is what.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He wants to know if Christian, Christian teachings also bring the same consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One has to become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no, no. He says that in the Bible it says one should not make an image of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In the Christian teachings... (German)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Neither a picture of Him nor a likeness, likeness</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they have got image of Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why, why they keep Lord Jesus Christ's picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the philosophy. I am asking. What is the philosophy of keeping...?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you object of Kṛṣṇa's form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (German conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, the Deities. He cannot understand the Deities, that we are worshiping the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deity, that is image of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That is (German conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the same principle. Why they should object having Kṛṣṇa's form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He says, it looks to him, it appears to him like a doll.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doll?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Who has designated you as the spiritual master, because everyone is saying that: "I am the spiritual master," So how, how, how will one know who is the spiritual master?</div>
