In this universe are they the same or...? Are they different every time? In other words, is the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> a history of what took place once, and then it will be different next time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not different. Each of them are identical.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Now we have stopped. We've reduced the quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you were purchasing more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We were purchasing because the <span class="Italic">ghee</span> was being used in all the preparations, in all the vegetable preparations...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Eighty-eight rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you collect only the <span class="Italic">ghee</span> price. And what about others? Other, <span class="Italic">attar</span> and sugar and so many things? That means you are spending hundred rupees, and the kitchen department, you are is collecting eighty rupees. So twenty rupees lost. Hm? So what is this business? What you are spending, you must collect also. Or balance you are eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> A few days ago a devotee donated three hundred rupees to the Deities.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are not making more and sell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, during the week there are not so many people. Like yesterday Patita-pāvana was explaining that there was <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> left over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you should know. You have experience when it is demand and more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes. That we know. We know the demand is at the weekends, and there's also some special festivals, so we make more <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> for these occasions.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So Bhargava has taken many good shots of the Deities on color film, and Gopāla Kṛṣṇa informed me that we should print postcard-size photos of the Deities and sell them for fifty paisas each. So that, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa is arranging for. [break] ...demand for <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> will go on increasing because one doctor came to our temple and informed us that at Bankebihari Mandir, because they have been giving out old <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> selling old <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> which is not in accordance with the health safety rules, they are going to take away that privilege of selling <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> from Bankebihari temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you don't do that. You prepare and sell fresh. Don't prepare more what is required. You have brought that pulleys?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The devotees' <span class="Italic">prasāda?</span> Devotees' <span class="Italic">bhoga?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotees or... Daily they were purchasing 125. But you said, "No, it must be more," and the banana is rotting. Why do you purchase more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, I allotted five rupees per person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it must be spent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, not it must be spent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Because five rupees allotted, then it must be spent. Never mind the fruits are rotten. What is this intelligence? To save money or to squander it, that is your policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So when you told Smara-hari to purchase in quantity, the first thing he purchased was bananas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he is monkey, he wants banana, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smara-hari:</span> You see, Prabhupāda, yesterday we fasted in the morning and because it was <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> there were extra bananas bought for yesterday morning, and they weren't used, so there are some left over. So this is why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why some left over?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smara-hari:</span> Because they weren't used yesterday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They weren't, but why it is left over?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Smara-hari:</span> They were saved for this morning to save money, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Rather than eat a lot of bananas yesterday afternoon, they were saved for this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When it is required, you can purchase. But I understand that you purchase more and it is left over. Don't squander money. <span class="Italic">Atyāhāraḥ prayāsaṣ ca prajalpo niya... [NoI 2]. Atyāhāra</span>-to eat more, to collect more, they are against <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> principle. And why they are going twice in the market?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Because sometimes Daivī-śakti, she does not give her list.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Does not give list-then don't bring. Everyone must supply list in the evening and once it should... (aside) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> It is not that Daivī-śakti gives one list-you have to go. What is this? Everything purchased in the morning, that's all. And rice, <span class="Italic">dahl, attar, ghee,</span> for fifteen days. Only the raw fruits and vegetables should be purchased every morning. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So Viśvambhara is going this morning to grain merchants to arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Viśvambhara is going to arrange that today, to purchase for fifteen days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any shopkeeper will supply fifteen days. He will bring at your home and your pay him, forthrightly? (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Should not the temple be kept open earlier than six o'clock in the afternoon? Many people are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six o'clock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> 5:15.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Six o'clock. The temple is going to open in the afternoon at six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Temple opens at four o'clock. The door of the gates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> No, temple, <span class="Italic">mandir.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The gates open at four o'clock, and the doors open at 5:15 for <span class="Italic">ārati. Ārati</span> is at 5:15.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> (to Indian man:) You are saying wrong. It's 5:15 every day. It's never late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not five? Why 5:15? Make it five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your signboard is "five." Why you make 5:15? Everything should be on routine, strictly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But the main gates are open to the public at four o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. They can wait on the corridor. I wanted Praṇava to speak, but he is not interested. What I can do? I told you that "You read books and speak. Try to preach." Yes. Did I not say? Did I not say to you that you and Dikṣita, "Study together and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Praṇava (an older Indian man):</span> We started immediately on the very same day. Next day I was asked to leave, so I have left.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Praṇava:</span> No. I can never leave for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then why don't you do that business? In the evening, four o'clock, you can speak. The whole day you can read and reproduce in the four o'clock. Then you understand what is the philosophy. If you simply reproduce what is written there in the book you become preacher. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha, tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> We haven't got to manufacture anything.</div>
