<div class="Heading">Press Interview at<br class="calibre2"/>Muthilal Rao's House<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>August 17, 1976, Hyderabad</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa says, the first beginning of the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> you have to take. (aside:) No children. Otherwise it will be disturbed. When Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as the spiritual master, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all, he was talking like friends. When he saw "The friendly talking will not help us," so Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master. Then as spiritual master He said, <span class="Italic">aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādāṁś ca bhāṣase: [</span>Bg. 2.11] "My dear Arjuna, you are lamenting on the subject matter which is not the subject matter of lamentation, and you are talking like a very learned man." <span class="Italic">Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> This body, either alive or dead, it is not a serious subject matter of study, neither a learned man laments over it. This is the subject matter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> or spiritual knowledge. Those who are not human being, according to Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> anyone who has no self-realization, he's animal. <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one is identifying with this body, "I am this body which is made of three elements, <span class="Italic">kapha, pitta, vāyu...</span>" <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke. Tri-dhātuke,</span> this combination of three elements. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's animal. So practically now in this age especially, everyone is identifying with this body. That is the basic principle of nationalism, communism, or this "ism" or that "ism." The bodily conception of life. And according to Vedic version, anyone who is identifying with this body, he is animal. So under the circumstances-(aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa-we are trying to revive the spiritual education of the human society. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. What is spirit soul, what is its identification, what is God, what is our relationship with Him, how to work on that plan. Then we become happy. Otherwise you may make various plan on material basis, it will never be successful and there is no question of happiness. Because the basic principle is lost. <span class="Italic">Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> This was spoken by Śukadeva Gosvāmī to Mahārāja Parīkṣit, that <span class="Italic">śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ</span> [SB 2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> The subject matter of hearing, there are many thousands for persons who has no self-realization.</div>
<div class="Verse">śrotavyādīni rājendra<br class="calibre2"/>nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 2.1.2]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Those who are not searching after self-realization, they have got many subject matter for hearing and deliberate. That means material subject matter. We have in the newspaper different subject matters for different public interest, but those who are searching after spiritual realization, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> As it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> also in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also, <span class="Italic">jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.</span> Human life means <span class="Italic">tattva-jijñāsā,</span> inquiry about the Absolute Truth. That is now stopped. People are not interested, self-realization, <span class="Italic">tattva-jijñāsā.</span> So this is an attempt to revive their spiritual consciousness, and it is authorized on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, without misinterpretation, and people are taking to it. So it is India's culture, and if we distribute this knowledge systematically, there are departments, cultural departments. So the things are there. If we cooperate, government and the public, then we can give to the whole world something which is very substantial. And there is no difficulty. The things are there, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and this is our movement. Now if you have got any question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India is already there, but suppressed them. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is there, but are you preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Why you don't preach this great science? Why you are disinterested? Answer this question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But who has to preach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to preach, because you are born in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But you yourself didn't preach it here. First you went to USA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is preaching. But the thing is that it is not in India, not outside India. But it is the duty of every Indian to do it. I tried preach it beginning from India, but nobody joined. Still they are not joining. What can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> But how to make the people realize importance of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you don't realize here is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken in India. If you don't take interest, who can induce you? If you don't take interest at all, those who are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they are making different interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> I am a layman, I do not know the importance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not a layman, you are a representative of paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He doesn't mean that he's a layman, but suppose he is a layman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Layman, he must go to a person who is experienced.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you are layman you must go to a person who has seen the truth. If you remain at home, then how you can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But I am so preoccupied with my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are taking so many education...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...that I don't have to time to contemplate or study such things. Don't you think it's the responsibility of people like you to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you are not properly trained up. The thing is, the first business of human being is to inquire about the spiritual subject matter. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is the Vedānta philosophy. Now we have got this human form of body, it is your duty to inquire about the spiritual subject matter. But if your guardians, if your parents, if your government does not teach you, then it is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Do you want this to become a part of the educational system here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the first education. Otherwise it is animal. Animal does not require absolute education. Animal is not able to understand what is self, what is God. But a man can. Therefore the man's first business is to understand this self-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Do you think it will come to India via the West now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Will it come to India via the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India is already there. You are neglecting. Why don't you admit that you are neglecting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Will that neglect go, disappear, through the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How will that? If you don't like it, how it will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> No, no, my colleague's point is, we have not been accepting, we are not able to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> on our own. Just because first Western people understand, and because of their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you have neglected. My charge is that you have neglected. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken in India. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is there. I think every home has got a <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but if you do not study it, you neglect it, that is your fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> No, that is because it is not part of the educational system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you have it. It is the first educational system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> No, but the system that we have here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have introduced. That is your unfortunate case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> No, that is because of historical reasons. We were ruined by a foreign...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the real subject matter of study you neglect, that is your negligence, your misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Now how to rectify this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take it now. You are simply arguing. Why don't you take it? That means you don't want to take it. There is the thing, but if you want, you can take it. But if you don't want, then how we can help you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> On you return from West do you feel..., do you think your movement in India has gained ground or created consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not interested in any particular country. This is meant for the whole human society. As you think "India" or "America," we do not think like that. We take the opportunity wherever it is possible to introduce more and more we take that opportunity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> What is the response in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian response we have seen when we held meeting in Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, thousands and thousands of people come here to hear about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Inherently they are inclined, but there is no systematic education. That is the defect. Now the <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī</span> day is coming I think every Indian will observe Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī,</span> without any fail. But they are not being educated systematically about Kṛṣṇa. They know Kṛṣṇa, they are inclined to Kṛṣṇa, the education of Kṛṣṇa is there, but nobody is interested to give them properly, systematically. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> How is the response in the West?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course it is a foreign thing for them, but still they are coming and taking it very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> Do you think they are taking to it because it is novel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? No, many novel things go from here, but they are sticking to it. They are now seriously taking to it. They understand that this is a great science and we are publishing books. We have already published eighty-four books like that. Eighty-four of four hundred pages. And you'll be surprised that throughout the whole world we are selling books about sixty thousand dollars a day. That means six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees. That is the basic income for our expenditure, 102 centers all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> A central minister the Parliament recently said that he will conduct a probe to see if there was anything fishy in this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I am bringing before you, before probing, you try to understand what is our income. We are selling these books six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees daily, and we are spending it fifty percent for reprinting the books and fifty percent for expanding temples all over the world. This is our activities. Now you probe it or understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> This is the only source of revenue for the society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Fifty percent books and for temples fifty percent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty percent for expanding temples and fifty percent for reprinting books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Do you have any other source, like donations or something like that for your movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very small. Mostly we have got a few cases of donation of land and house. Not very large sum or money, never.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> But I thought Henry Ford has given some... I thought the Ford family has given some huge donation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ford, he has given us two, three houses, not donation. But we have purchased two, three houses by the money of Mr. Ford, Alfred Ford, he's my disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Some members the Parliament says, the movement is in some anti-Indian activities. What do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are intelligent man, you see what is that anti-Indian. We are spreading Indian culture, and this is anti-Indian. How foolish they are. Just see. We are spreading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and it is anti-Indian. Do you think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> What if somebody is using this as a cover-up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? But if you have no eyes to see inside, you see the cover only. What can I do? (laughter) If you are so blind, what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> What has the (indistinct) doing about solving world problems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every problem can be solved by <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Every problem can be solved by <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You put any problem and there is answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> How this movement has helped in solving any specific issue, any special problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We think the real problem is they do not know what they are.</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Our modern education, they do not believe that there is spirit soul within the body and the spirit soul transmigrates from one body to another. Where is that education? Is there any education that there is spirit soul within the body and that spirit soul is transmigrating from one body to another? Is there any education, scientific education, all over the world? That is the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> You mean to say that this should become part, an integral part of the educational system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the most important part. If you do not know what you are, then you are talking like a nonsense. If you have lost your identity, then what is your education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> No, but we should realize the politicians...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a question of politician or economics. It is general education, that you must know your identity, what you are. Then knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> I am living under the system, and that system is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if the system is wrong, then you are living wrongly. You are misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> That means the movement should make an attack on the politicians, people who make the decisions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Politician, of course, it is, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated <span class="Italic">imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> This system, this science, was understood by the <span class="Italic">rājarṣi,</span> kings who were as good as <span class="Italic">ṛṣis, rājarṣis.</span> So where is that politician, politician as good as a <span class="Italic">ṛṣi</span>? That is the difficulty. It is meant for <span class="Italic">rājarṣi. Rāja</span> and <span class="Italic">ṛṣi.</span> Just like Janaka Mahārāja, Parīkṣit Mahārāja, Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja, Prahlāda Mahārāja, they were kings, but they were at the same time so great and saintly, they were called <span class="Italic">rājarṣi,</span> and this is a subject matter for the <span class="Italic">rājarṣis. Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">, manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt,</span> uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Vivasvān manave prāha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">vivasvān manave prāha manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So where is <span class="Italic">rājarṣi</span>? That is the difficulty. Where is that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> where is that <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> where is that system? Now anyone can capture the political power by hook and crook, that is another thing. But it is meant for the <span class="Italic">rājarṣi, imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ.</span> Where is their training? The politician, where he is trained up as <span class="Italic">ṛṣi</span>? There is no such service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Has there been any official opposition to your movement in any country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Your movement is spreading largely. Do you think that it will be welcome in the Communist countries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have been in Moscow. I saw many learned professors. We are selling our books there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> You are selling your books in Moscow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Everyone, every intelligent man will accept. We are selling books in East Germany, which is Communist. They are taking our books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Are there any centers of the society in the Communist world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have not tried so far. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Maybe such a thing is not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have gone there, but there are difficulties to start. People are interested. Everywhere people are interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> What is the response in the Islamic countries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we have got many students. In Iran we have got center and there are many Muslims. They are our student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> What is the response in Iran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Iran? The response, they are hearing, but some of them, they are already converted student. Our head of the institution in Iran is Ātreya Ṛṣi. His name was Attar (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> You have some project here. Can you kindly explain what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our project is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and apply it practically in your life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are trying to establish an institution in Kurukṣetra to teach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in practical life and inviting students all over the world. That is our program. We have asked for some land from the government. So if the government gives us the land, we can try it also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> (indistinct) Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> Here also you have some land or something, I was told.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> In Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> You have some project?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are trying to... (to devotee:) Land, what is that land? You can give the description.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is near (indistinct) village. It has not yet been confirmed, it is under procedure, but we are trying to develop a big project there, depending on formal procedures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our project is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Come here, live peacefully, keep your body fit, and work for yourself, you produce your own food, you produce your own cloth, don't be very much anxious for artificial necessities, and save time, and be advanced in spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> Some sort of religious epithet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not exactly religious. You have taken by it because we misunderstand the meaning of <span class="Italic">religion.</span> Religion generally understood as a kind of cult and faith. But in the Vedic literature, religion means the characteristic. Just like sugar is sweet, that is its religion. If sugar becomes pungent, that is not sugar's characteristic. Similarly, a human being must be God conscious. So that God consciousness is religion. Because in the human form of life one can understand what is God, and if he does not become, he remains an animal. Animal cannot understand. So therefore his business is how to <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is not our manufactured word, this is the Vedānta words. <span class="Italic">Atha,</span> now we have got this human form body, based on that transmigration of the soul after millions and millions of years, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> you have got this human form of life, now it is your business to inquire about the Absolute Truth. This is the business of human life. And <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna,</span> how to eat, how to sleep, how to enjoy sex life and how to defend, that is animal business. If you remain busy with these four principles of bodily necessities of life, <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithuna,</span> then you remain on he animal platform. Beyond that, when you inquire about God, that is human life. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> So we are trying to raise him from this animal life to human life. This is our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (3):</span> So you help people inquire God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because that is business. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i></span> But they are forgetting that, that there is necessity of inquiring about God. To inquire about my relationship with God, what is God, they are neglecting this. Not only here, all over the world, it is becoming more and more acute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> So in relation to your movement, where does Marxism stand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not my movement, it is the Vedic culture. Don't think... If you say "my movement," I have manufactured something. Not. This is the Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> No, from the standpoint of this culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Standpoint is that I am trying to revive the Vedic culture, that's all. That is my business. I am not manufacturing anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> No, but how do you explain the advance that Marxism has made in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How do you explain the advance that Marxism has made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many "isms." If I go to criticize and study, it will take most of our time. Better positively present what you want. If you like you can take it, that's all. There are so many "isms." When we become animal, then we manufacture so many "isms."</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Those who are not fixed up, they have got so many "isms," and those who are fixed up, they have got one "ism"-that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are teaching that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> So is it correct from what that any culture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is correct because Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa is infallible. We are not manufacturing anything, so it is correct because Kṛṣṇa says. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> He is the supreme authority. But we have no faith in Kṛṣṇa, therefore we manufacture something other than Kṛṣṇa. That is our misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> You mean to say that any system that doesn't subscribe to this movement has no future at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> But that is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we say practically. What is the use of "ism," manufactured by imperfect senses. We have got defects. Our..., we commit mistake. Who is the person who does not commit mistake? None. We accept this body, which I am not, this is called <span class="Italic">pramada. Pramada vipralipsa,(?)</span> without any perfect knowledge you want to teach. That is cheating. <span class="Italic">Vipralipsa.</span> And <span class="Italic">karnapada</span>(?), our senses are imperfect. So how you can give perfect knowledge with all this imperfection? Unless you become perfect, you cannot give perfect knowledge. So any knowledge given by any imperfect person, we reject immediately, useless waste of time. And actually that is the fact. If you are blind, you cannot see. You say, "Here is the elephant, a big <span class="Italic">stambha</span>, pillar," by seeing his leg, by touching his leg. But elephant is just like a pillar? That is our speculation. <span class="Italic">Andha-kūpa,</span> what is called? <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍūka.</span> A frog in the well is trying to study Atlantic Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍūka</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍūka.</span> What you know about the Atlantic Ocean who's living within three feet of land, water? <span class="Italic">Kūpa-maṇḍūka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (?):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upastha</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (?):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samāsa.</span> So we are imperfect, just like they are going to study the planets. What they will study from here? This kind of knowledge has no value, speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> That is something inborn, isn't it? That scientists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is your inquisiti... You have got born inquisitiveness, <span class="Italic">jijñāsu,</span> that is especially manifested in human form of life. So for <span class="Italic">jijñāsu</span> it is recommended, <span class="Italic">tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to go to the proper person. So that we are not doing. <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta. Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the Vedic injunctions. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsu</span> is our natural instinct, but we go to who has no knowledge. That is the difficulty. We are misled. But the knowledge is there already, the Vedic knowledge is there. There are so many <span class="Italic">Vedas, Upaniṣads, Vedānta-sūtra,</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Rāmāyaṇa, Mahābhārata, Purāṇas,</span> but there is no systematic study of this literature. We are neglecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (5):</span> Swamiji, another doubt. In this <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> that you publicize, Hare Kṛṣṇa, it is Kṛṣṇa that is emphasized. (indistinct) emphasis His <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and other things are popularized. Is it corresponding...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything. If you have studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">. Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme. If you accept it that this is supreme name of God, Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is the Vedic injunction. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He said <span class="Italic">paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there. It is not a manufactured program. It is based on <span class="Italic">śāstra. Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet. Kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ.</span> These things are there. You have to accept some authority. If you don't accept authority, you speculate. That is your business, but we don't do. We accept the authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> The same claim is made by Durgā also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (4):</span> (indistinct)-<span class="Italic">śakti</span> cult, they also give you the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Durgā, we say</div>
<div class="Verse">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā<br class="calibre2"/>chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā<br class="calibre2"/>icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.44]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Durgā is all-powerful within this material world, but she is acting under the direction of Govinda. She is not acting independently. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also it is said <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> Under My supervision. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is the supreme authority. [break] ...but they go to the supreme person who can give spiritual knowledge. Durgā is not neglected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Host:</span> With your permission I must thank with the permission of Swamiji, my friends, I welcome you to my humble house. Today, though you are all very, very busy, but you have made it a point to come and listen to Swamiji speak to you theory, lessons, and his belief and faith. It depends how we take it. Because I have faith in him, I have faith in his teachings, that is why, I being a politician, I being a member of Parliament and the legislative assembly, deputy minister and the ambassador, I have requested and begged of him to come to my humble house to spread his knowledge, which he is giving to the other parts of the world. Last time he visited in a very similar manner, we have got a small gathering here. So at that time I hope you will pardon me, I couldn't think of you all, thinking that, you know, the journalist friends are my good friends, and they are very knowledgeable friends, and that is why they can put so many questions. And by putting so many questions will get the answers by that we are enlightened. So that is why now it is the time for Swamiji to go for <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span> He has given me something. I am a student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> My guruji is there, he's doing <span class="Italic">pūjā.</span> He has given me something when I met him, when I heard him, he has given me a <span class="Italic">gupta-dāna.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dātavyam iti yad dānaṁ dīyate 'nupakāriṇe deśe kāle ca pātre ca tad dānaṁ sāttvikaṁ smṛtam.</span> It is in the Seventeenth Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is as far as <span class="Italic">sukṛta</span> is concerned. So that is why he has given me something that indirectly <span class="Italic">gupta-dāna.</span> So I said always I should follow. Unfortunately, I could not meet him. Recently when I was..., till recently when I was an ambassador I was to go to Nairobi, I was in Somalia, but unfortunately things couldn't materialize. But now if at all I get an opportunity of going abroad I shall be visiting all the institutions, their organizations, their temples, because I am a member of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, life member. I have canvassed, some have become. Canvassed means I've just put a word. Some have become, I who requested, some of my friends who have not become, to become members of Kṛṣṇa conscious, permanent members, life members, like Mrs. Yamuna is here. Yamuna's husband, Raman Rao is here. And I would like you also to become, others also to become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was explaining, <span class="Italic">imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the big big politicians, head of the state, they understand, <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ lokas tad anuvartate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">,</span> others will follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Host:</span> Others will follow. So I must thank you for coming. I request you, if you have little time, you could sit there and listen to Swamiji, other people also are coming, and have little <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and go, see, after having come to my humble house, see my <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> room also, how humbly I keep that <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> room, so that we learn, we must learn to keep up our religion. When we become educated, when we become ministers, ambassadors, we forget our.... When we become big people, very big people, our eyes jump up and go to the head here. When we become rich people and money people-who is speaking to you? Not a rich man. A man who comes from a humble family. The man who was born in a tiled-roofed house. So I have never changed. My, among my friends, you have seen a friends sitting here, and also the village which I come from, he has seen where I staying and where I am staying now. But I am not changed. But at the same time I have not forgotten my religion. I have not changed my faith. Many people say you must know that I drink. Am I a drunkard? Am I a trouble-maker? No. Sometimes in the society it becomes a necessity. I am not a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> I have not renounced the world. Many of you have drunk with me. Some of you at least. So what? Am I a sinner, if I remember my religion, if I pray my God, if I pray my Lord? No. I do not dupe anybody, do not cheat anybody, do not harm anybody, do not hurt anybody. That's what I have been following. That is why I think my God has been very very kind to me. That is why, because of Lord Kṛṣṇa, all of you have been very kind to me throughout... Can you imagine a poor man born in a poor family winning four elections without money? People spend <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Lord knows in 1952 how much money have I spent? Two thousand rupees. '58, '57 maybe twelve thousand rupees. '62 maybe about forty to forty-five thousand. Of course, '67 was expensive for me. I had to sell away my humble house. So this is all faith. Faith in God, faith in country, that is patriotism. Without patriotism we talk and yap a lot. "What do you think of this? What do you think of this?" My country is my country, no other country. This is my country. That is <span class="Italic">deśa-bhakti.</span> All people say that, you know, "My religion is my religion, that is my <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> But my country comes first." That is known as patriotism. In Urdu it is said, (indistinct) "We will die for the nation one day." If you remember, my friends, I was one of those in 1962 offered to join as a soldier against Chinese aggression. Not only offered, I have submitted my resignation to Jawaharlal Nehru, which was not accepted because of certain problems at that time. Because of my age, because of my age, and also the Bilateral Talks, Colombo Proposals came. Never mind. That should be the spirit among us, and particularly youngsters, particularly youngsters. They must not forget their religion, they must not forget their country. So anyway, leaders come and go, we all come and go. I am not a leader, please don't put me as a leader. I am one of the humblest workers in this country. I am coming from the humblest section of the society also. The leaders come. (Hindi) If you want to translate you translate, (Hindi). But the country remains (Hindi). (end)</div>
