<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make very nice palatable <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> We shall spend for that. Why miserly? There is no need of miserly. You are going to earn money by agricultural produce, so how the money will be utilized? It will be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. By <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> by chanting, by drama, somehow or other bring them. That is our mission. Congregational chanting. Always festival, and we shall spend for that. Immediately arrange. If there is scarcity of money, I shall pay, but from... Bring them somehow or other. Tomorrow I want to see at least 500 men. Make arrangement like that. I came here to see that, not to sit down in a room peacefully. So there also we shall inform the meeting that we want to propagate this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement town to town, village to village, by attracting them with musical demonstration of <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> dramatic play, movie, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Somehow or other they should come to the temple, to the <span class="Italic">pandal</span> and congregationally chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> hear <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Bhāgavatam.</span> For this purpose, whatever expenditure is required, that you should collect and spend. This is the scheme of Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. You must come here, question, understand, and vigorous propaganda should be inaugurated town to town, village to village. Those who are educated, to them distribution of literature. The school, college, library, institution, university, by scholarly presentation. That is wanted. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it doesn't matter. Understand the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To attract them to really nice <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> palatable food, we shall spend. And we shall argue (?) also by literature produced, and they're learning. Where is the difficulty? We shall take contribution from rich persons. We shall earn ourself, and spend it, to give them very nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Gradually when they come, when you engage them in producing their own food, own shelter, own cloth... This should be organized. And they'll be glad. As soon as they understand, they will be glad to do. And they will stop all this nonsense: illicit sex, and meat eating. Then their life will be purified. And they'll make more and more advancement in this path. That is perfection. That you want. Is it clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes? This is our mission. If you give them very nice palatable <span class="Italic">prasādam...</span> They go to hotel from miles together to take some palatable foodstuff, restaurant, hotel. And we cannot give nice Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span> Why? Why you cannot give? Arrange like that, first class. Simply for eating they will come. Immediately do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I have a question, whether we should always give them <span class="Italic">khicuṛi</span> or whether we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them nice <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> by which they are attracted. It doesn't matter <span class="Italic">khicuṛi, puri, kacuri, lāḍu. </span>Whatever they are attracted, we must give. Whatever that will attract them. That I want. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-prasādam.</span> Don't waste, give them nice palatable foodstuff. Give them one finest <span class="Italic">kacuri,</span> one nice <span class="Italic">samosā,</span> two <span class="Italic">puris,</span> they will be very glad. Make very, very, nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> What is this rubbish, the dog cannot eat even? They have done a great mistake, all rascals. I am very angry. I say that if you have got no money, I'll spend, I will give you money. Why should you make such tenth class, and no food at all. It is to be thrown away. Simply waste of grains and energy. Engage nice professional cook, prepare nice foodstuff. I shall spend for that if you have no money. Gentlemen who are coming immediately should be offered some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> "Please come here, take: <span class="Italic">puri, kacuri, samosā.</span>" Arrangement should be like that. The doctors came, he comes out of love, but there is no <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Huh? What is this? The doctor comes, but we couldn't supply him <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at 12 o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not today, the other day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda</span> is not yet ready, you also said. After eating I have no, not yet ready. What is this? At 2 o'clock? As soon as they want. The Vṛndāvana also, the same thing I told that what they are doing? <span class="Italic">Prasādam,</span> as soon as they want, they'll must feed some <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> according to the position of the person. We shall spend for that. I am not hesitating to spend money, why the arrangement is lacking? Immediately arrange for theirs and invite them. Don't make it childish. Where are the leaders, they are now engaged there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our leaders are engaged there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> At the <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Mahāṁśa is there. I don't know where Haṁsadūta is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, this is my instruction. We have to written and discuss and go. And I want to see tomorrow many thousand people. If you cannot make attractive, why they will come? Then it is failure. Make attractive. Whatever money is required, I shall pay. Simply theory will not help. Make such <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> as people will come and be mad after it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just explain. You have taken in writing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's on tape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go and discuss. They must be attracted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise it is failure. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> ...who came, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are satisfied?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No. The people also, there was no advertisement that today there would be a program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever it is required, you do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So on tomorrow, I will do the advertisement and show them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give them very, very first class <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will come for the tongue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. Today the dallers (?), they liked it very spicy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they like, I do not know what they like. But you prepare they should come and eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know what they like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> There is a lot of <span class="Italic">sabji</span> in the <span class="Italic">ḍāl</span> also, today and it's hot. They like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, whatever they like, the villagers, you prepare. If you have no money, I shall pay money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> O.K.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But attract them. They will come here to eat, "Oh, very nice thing." That is wanted. I made this movement successful simply by love feast. They did not come to hear Hare Kṛṣṇa. They came for love feast. From very beginning, when I was in 26 2nd Avenue, every Sunday I was giving nice foodstuff, at least 200 men. Daily at least more than 15, 20. I was cooking myself. That is the beginning of my movement. The <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> with Kīrtanānanda, first of all he was taking one and two, then twelve. (laughter) There was another boy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Stryādhīśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stryādhīśa. Twenty-two cāpāṭis. (laughter) "Stryādhīśa, can I give you?" "Yes." I gave him four. Finished. "Stryādhīśa, can I give you?" "Yes." (laughter) Very nice boy. He was eating twenty-two. One day there was no money, so he immediately went and came after some time with some money. "And where did you go?" The shoe booth. He polished shoes and brought some money. (laughter) In this way, this was developed. Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Any gentleman comes, immediately there must be some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Engage first class cook. Spend money, don't be a miserly. If you have no money, I will pay. So long I am living, I shall go on paying. You don't be miserly. Bring devotees for eating, and then chanting, then cinema, then lecture, in this way you have to develop. Not that people will come, "Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is there, let us go there." They will not come. What do they know about Hare Kṛṣṇa? They will come, "Oh, there is nice, good <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distributed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Some people I know, they said that yesterday the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> was not nice, and there was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not nice, it is not eatable even by the dogs. But you are less than the dogs if you (prepare) such thing. I was surprised. You allowed a sweeper to cook. I was surprised. We have distribution <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> not dog's food. Such rascals as here. You do not know. I do not wish to discuss anymore on this point. You have murdered the whole thing in two days. Now if possible, bring them, bring them first class <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> very palatable. Foodstuff means even one has no appetite he'll eat. That is food. Not that even one has got appetite, he'll forget. That is not food. So do like that and for money produce, use cane, sugar cane, rice. We shall spend for that. Don't spoil money, but do like businessman. He invests money, he gets a return. Spend it for Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. There is no question of becoming a miser. I never did it. When I have got that farthing, I want to spend it. Immediately spend. Oh, what I have made this BBT? Immediately 50% for printing, and 50% for spreading this. (indistinct) and understand what I want to do. So whatever is done is done, now do it very nicely. I want to see at least 1,000 men coming from the villages. There are 20,000 men here, you cannot attract them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Do we announce that you will give <span class="Italic">darśana</span> on the stage for five minutes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Can we announce...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody will come for my <span class="Italic">darśana,</span> but if you want I'll go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not very difficult task.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Because they are all very anxious to see you, because the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, I shall go. What is that? The difficulty is I would gone very gladly, but they do not understand my language, neither Hindi, nor English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It can be translated in Telugu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I am shall go. I shall go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall go. I shall speak. Give them very nice food. From tomorrow I will... If there are rascals, you'll bring. I will pay nice cook. Make varieties, very palatable food. <span class="Italic">Kichranna,(?) puṣpānna,</span> rice, there are so many preparations. <span class="Italic">Paramānna.</span> You do not make <span class="Italic">paramānna, kichranna,(?) puṣpānna.</span> There are varieties of rice preparation. They know, the southern people, with curd, yogurt...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Tamarind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Tamarind, so many preparations. So make like that. Why dog eating? They are not dogs. You cannot expect, because you are giving some dog eatable food, they will come. There must be one first class cook, and all our men should learn. There's no need of simply keeping unduly: Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, and sleeping. We don't want such men. Make a show. And do not know anything how to preach. Useless. The householder, the women should be engaged in cooking. Their children should be gathered together. One man... I have said many times, all the children should be taken in a room by one woman, and others should be engaged in the cooking department. I have seen it. Your country, America. When they go to church, all the childrens are gathered together in a room. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And one or two men take care. And others, they go. Similarly, children they must have, so... Not that everyone is children busy, "I cannot do." They cannot do if they are busy with children. What is the use of keeping such householders? Let them live outside, earn their money. Women business is to cleanse, to cut the vegetables, to cook, what is this? They're simply busy with the children? And they have started their mission for maintaining some children, and useless women. You should organize. <span class="Italic">Rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana.</span> All the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they are engaged for cooking for Kṛṣṇa. Mother Yaśodā will call them, "You young girls, you can cook very nicely."</div>
<div class="Verse">rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana<br class="calibre2"/>parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Do you understand Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhikā with Her friends, they are cooking. And they cook so nicely that <span class="Italic">parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana.</span> With great pleasure Kṛṣṇa is eating. And that we have to distribute. Not dog's food. You do not know what is the purpose of this mission. No need. Here is a good chance, don't spoil it. Produce food. Make profit, you spend for Kṛṣṇa. Train all devotees how to cook. All women. Don't distribute dog's eatable things. Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">rādhikāra pakka anna vividha byañjana<br class="calibre2"/>parama ānande kṛṣṇa korena bhojana</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kṛṣṇa is taking with great pleasure. That <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> you have to distribute. Not that dog is rejecting and you have and you distribute that <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Why do you think like that? This <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> this so-called, rubbish thing which is rejected by dog and you are offering to the human being. You do it. If you have no money I shall pay. There is no question of scarcity of money. Don't spoil money, but spend for real purpose, that's all. And you arrange for huge agricultural... Whatever is required, water, we shall arrange for that. Labor. Everything. And if you perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> there will be rain. Anyway, I asked you the other day to fill up the tank. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Which tank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That big tank. Well, big well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just here. The one that's been pumped empty. Anyway the big empty...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you were surprised. You do not know that we have got a big well here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The one that we drink water from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The big square one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Behind the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is empty? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Fill it for what, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the well is empty? There is no water. He's surprised. As if dropping from the sky. You do not know that well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It's just a tank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tank, yes. Why it is empty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Because I didn't know what purpose it will serve by filling it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Filling it, we shall pump and distribute water. You shall fit pipes. And pump water and distribute to the field, so there will be no scarcity of water, and produce. What it was meant, you do not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No, right now, that field does not need water to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are not growing there something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The paddy is drying over there, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there are so many other fields. Why they are empty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh, we have to go and do boring wells and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore that means water supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, that's what I have to arrange now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. So why, when you will arrange? Arrange it immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, before...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is also one of the water pool to solve water problem. The tank. Do you follow what I say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You fill up the tank and by pumping through pipe, you distribute water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The viaducts are already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got water filled up in that tank, we can water so many lands. We shall spend for that. We shall... Pipe line, pumping. Here is so much land we can produce <span class="Italic">gur </span>(?). But you have no brain. Produce <span class="Italic">gur,</span> get money and spend it for Kṛṣṇa. This is wanted. Not simply planning and talking. The world is suffering for want of right planning. Otherwise, there is no question of suffering. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇam idam,</span> complete it is, everything complete. That is the Vedic verse. Why (indistinct) ...incomplete means he's rascals. That supply [break] and still all right. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Kṛṣṇa does not want to see that we are starving for want of food. That He does not want to see. But because you have come to the material world, you have to work hard. Then you'll get your food. That is the material world. <span class="Italic">Śarīra-yātrāpi ca te na prasiddhyed akarmaṇaḥ,</span> Kṛṣṇa says. Very... If you do not work, then you cannot get food. Simply work together. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāma-dughā mahī</span>. And you get from the land. You have got land. You get anything from the land. The land must be moist. Then you get everything. That we want to show. Hm, what do you say? Land is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? You are intelligent, you... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> You are the intelligent man, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what do you think this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, it's wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Vṛndāvana I saw a water-bull, just goes around in the circle all day and makes the water come up on these little catchers. And then it goes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so many means there are watering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The whole field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. People have lost the program. These rascals they draw all these men to manufacture Goodyear tire and eat store (?). This is going on. Modern man, they draw all these man, "Come on, I shall pay you 20 rupees daily. Prepare Goodyear tire, and eat store. Take paper. Purchase store. That's all. This is going on. What brain they will have? Twenty rupees they get and they spend ten rupees for wine, and five rupees for cigarette, and fooding, say five rupees. No ghee, no milk. Soul killing civilization. And again this soul killing civilization. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Hm, what you wanted to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This, your Dr. Ghosh, where he is staying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We were there this afternoon for a program, and all their land is so green, and they are growing vegetables by a patch no bigger than this mattress that you are sitting. They are working one, planting, then growing another. Just a small piece, they're planting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have some way for the water to go to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should do like that here, in our land. Do like that. If they can do here, some few miles away...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you can do it. Do it immediately. See how they are doing. So much land, why it should remain vacant? So combinedly immediately begin. Mm. So how long you are staying here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Till Sunday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So your business is complete or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, give him all help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, people are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is doing very nice there, and he'll do very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> One thing I thought it would be good if your divine grace would write a letter making him the GBC, so that he can act with full authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll give full authority. Write letter I shall sign. Yes. You have full authority. Write letter, I'll sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> By your talking, I'm also thinking we should have a farm in Germany, I know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, why not? Everywhere. I myself when I go to the farm, I forget whether it is India, or Germany, or France. I forget. The land is there. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāma-dughā</span>. We get everything from that. I have several times said that why they make this distinction? This is France, this is India, this is... Everywhere is God's land. Why these rascals make division, I do not understand. Every land belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and you are sons of Kṛṣṇa. Let us live peacefully and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. All rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> There is rain now and then fall in Europe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, now it's very much.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Now it's too late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, it wasn't there, but now it's so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. But God is giving hint that if, "Rascal, it is in My hand. I can keep you in starvation to death." The man is dull brain. Anyway, I am anxious to learn, why so many people are suffering? They have become all gray. Throughout whole France I saw. From Paris to Valencay I went. Gray. These people are not lazy, but there was no water. They utilize every inch land for agricultural purpose. At least I saw in France. Then maybe everywhere in Europe. They are not lazy fellow. There is organization, government organization here. People, they... Anyway let us show some example. Immediately make program. You have seen, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you are expert. Do it immediately. If there is requires some money, we shall pay. Fill up. What is the difficulty in filling up this tank?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...it's empty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No one ever swim in here. We took out water to water the fields.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why it is empty? Have it filled up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> How to fill? It has to come by itself. The water comes from the recuperation from the soil, so it is not in our hands to fill it. It just comes by itself slowly. It takes six days. If we empty the well it takes takes 6 days to fill it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. By the... By digging a well or something you cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> If we do a boring, then that's, the well can be filled. We have a pump and we can fill it. But now as it is, it's fifty feet deep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not make boring?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> That is my plan, that is what I was telling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why plan, why do it now?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Tomorrow we should go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> It's the first business. We should go to that place and have him come, start the pool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Water required. Fill up with water and distribute water and produce. Huge quantity. Whatever can be produced. Sugar cane, rice, these are very valuable commodity at the present moment. Produce. And sugar cane means the upper portion will be the food for the cow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Even rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even... Oh, yes. Very, very practic... We want some (indistinct) food. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">. Bhūtāni</span> means both animal and men. Animals should be well fed. Not only human being, but animal also. Otherwise, how he'll work? Don't use tractor, use this bulls. Otherwise there will be a problem, how to engage the bulls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Engage them for transport, for plowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We should not get a tractor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When you have got bulls, why should you get...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We have only 8 pairs of bulls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and other bulls have been eaten up. Now we stop that eating. Now if you need, you can purchase tractor. But as far as possible try to avoid, and engage the bulls. Otherwise, it will be problems. The Europeans have invented tractors, and the bull is a problem. Therefore they must be sent to the slaughterhouse. So we can not create that problem. How the bull should be utilized? They should be used for transport, and plowing. What is this turmoil?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think they are distributing <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Now, they have finished the slide-show and they are sitting down for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Go and see it is done. Announce that "Tomorrow we shall prepare such and such nice preparations. Please you are especially invited." In this way attract. (end)</div>
