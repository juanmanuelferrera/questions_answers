<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> To transport the medicine, someone can bring it from Calcutta here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or the same things, if the ingredients can be gotten from Delhi or Agra, they can be prepared here. We have Prabhupāda's car. We can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> It's distilled. He has got to distill the medicine. For that he needs proper apparatus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He's saying Śrīla Prabhupāda should drink at least a kilo of milk every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew! If he personally feeds Prabhupāda, I can believe that he'll take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> He said that for ten, fifteen days let him be like this here, and then he'll take him to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And he can take personal charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So now you have to get these medicines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. He wants to see the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> also, because he's going to give some instructions to him in case, when he is not here, so that he can... (Hindi) There's a young <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> in the Rāmānuja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But that other gentleman will not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, no, not him. I'm talking about Śrī Raṅgajī's temple there is a young <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So in that way he was thinking to leave, but now he's agreed to stay on for at least five or six days. We convinced him that "You stay here and you take Prabhupāda to Māyāpura personally." That's what we're pushing for. We explained how all of his patients put together multiplied by one <span class="Italic">crore</span> cannot equal Your Divine Grace. And he agreed. He said, "That I know." And we explained that... He was quoting from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So we explained how Your Divine Grace was the representative and incarnation of Vyāsadeva, and he accepted that. He has very high respect for Vyāsadeva and for you because he's seen your books. He knows that you're not ordinary. Then he described what was wrong with you and how he's going to be treating it. Then I was asking him what is his native place. So he's a Marwari. Then he was telling us the native town. And I asked him if he had any charitable dispensary. He said he wouldn't take any money. We were trying to think of different ways to... Anyway, he wouldn't take any money. Then he said... He talked about his father. His father was a very big devotee of Nṛsiṁhadeva. So one day his father plus eleven other Vaiṣṇavas went to Badarikāśrama for <span class="Italic">darśana</span> of the Deities. They were walking, and on the way they were attacked by these <span class="Italic">baels.(?)</span> They're called <span class="Italic">baels?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Aborigines in the north. Very ferocious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're ferocious men. So the men said that "Now we will kill you and take your money, plunder you." So his father said, "Well, we will give you whatever we have, but what is the use of killing us?" They said, "No, we are not <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> We are aborigines. So we like to kill also." So then the father said, "Then at least, the king, even if he hangs someone, he gives them five minutes for prayer. So give us five minutes." So then all of the Vaiṣṇavas, they chanted Nṛsiṁhadeva <span class="Italic">mantras</span> very strongly. And suddenly there was a strong roaring of a lion, and a big ferocious lion leaped into the middle and ate up two of the attackers. And then all of the Vaiṣṇavas, they bowed down at the feet of the lion and they were offering prayers, and the lion went away. So his father... He said that if one has a pure heart, if he's a pure Vaiṣṇava, Kṛṣṇa can appear. He said in the form of the lion Kṛṣṇa actually protected them. So he wants to make some charitable dispensary in his home town on behalf of his father. I'm thinking if he cures you we will give him a nice donation towards that charitable dispensary. Then we told him that... We asked him what kind of food does he like. So he told us, so that now we'll make arrangement. We gave him very good food this morning, and we will cook him <span class="Italic">ruṭis.</span> Bhakti-caru and another devotee are cooking. So they will cook him fresh vegetables as he likes, according to his taste. And Adri-dhāraṇa serves him personally. And then I said also, "While you're here, there's much time. We can take you to the different temples." Because this is the first time he's come to Vṛndāvana. I said, "Even in the afternoon you can go with Prabhupāda's car to Govardhana." He said, "First of all, before <span class="Italic">darśana,</span> let us do the medicine." So he went with the car. He said, "I will drive the car. I can drive." We said, "We have a driver." He said, "If you don't have a driver, I will drive to get the medicine." So then they went into the city to get..., into Vṛndāvana to get the necessary medicines. He said very strongly, "What I prescribe, no <span class="Italic">vaidya</span> can talk over what I prescribe. If I prescribe something, it is correct. That I'm sure." But he is very devotional, very <span class="Italic">pakka,</span> like a Marwari, just like a high-class life member. He sits very straight and he's... Now we will have to see. But the main point we stressed is that you will not have confidence in anyone else. So there's no point in..., that he should tell some other man that in his absence, "Do like this." Because supposing in his absence the medicine doesn't work right. Then the other <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> becomes the <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> That we don't want. I said, "You must see the reaction of the medicines, and you must... When Prabhupāda eats, you must sit there and watch and see what he's eating, see everything." And he said, "That I will do." Another nice, thing Śrīla Prabhupāda. Remember, you initiated one devotee, Rādhā-Ramaṇa Goswami? You remember his father and mother, Joshis, from Delhi? You lived with them. So he wrote a letter to you about a week ago, saying that he wanted to come back. So I wrote him, "Yes, you come. Prabhupāda will see you." So he came today. He's in saffron with shaved head. So I thought afterwards he can come and... He wants to become a devotee again. He's wasted his five years. He knows he's wasted time. Akṣayānanda Mahārāja suggested that he can engage in helping Bhakti-prema Swami. Because Bhakti-prema, he dictates, but he needs someone to hear and to write. This way, he'll be working for your books and hearing the philosophy, and he's a literate person. Three years in college. Anyway, he returned today. Nanda-kumāra also came. He arrived yesterday. So gradually everyone is returning to your lotus feet, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Not possible to leave you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So would you like to go on the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> this morning? We can make arrangements now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> We have some grape juice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to take something, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Drinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have taken in the morning Horlicks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You took Horlicks? Want to take anymore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> We have some here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Grape juice they prepared, should you want to take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's about ten to eleven, Śrīla Prabhupāda, about ten minutes to eleven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...we can go on <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> The weather is cool in Vṛndāvana now, even during the day. We'll put your sunglasses on so you won't be disturbed by the light. (background talking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> It's grape juice, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja and I went into the temple for <span class="Italic">darśana,</span> and we were commenting how the people are so impressed by the Deities, all of the visitors, especially Rādhā-Śyāmasundara. They're so beautifully dressed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhavānanda Mahārāja was saying how last night you were saying that there's nothing nicer and more fortunate than to be the <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> of a Deity. [break] We'll just get the sum and substance. He's offering his obeisances to Bhavānanda Mahārāja and the other devotees he met here. He says he's very anxious about your health and progress. He requested me to give him a report. He says as regards to starting of the dispensary and also organizing a health teaching center for educating the boys by the latest audio-visual methods, he said that you seemed to be very earnest about it. In fact, he says that you told him to start as soon as possible. But he wishes to explain some of his difficulties. So Sharma and Jagadīśa, the director of education, and... They they've promised to go through the idea. But he didn't find that Dr. Sharma showed much inclination for this idea. The actual thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that we want him to have a dispensary. We're not so much eager for his educational training. Naturally Dr. Sharma was not so enthusiastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Ours is spiritual education, no medical education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. That's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preliminary health principles, they can le...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's already going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Sharma is teaching Ayurvedic, basic Ayurvedic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, anyway, that's... So I'll explain to him that what we want... I already wrote him a letter inviting him to... He can have two rooms, one for his living and one for his dispensary, and treat the inmates here. I'll again repeat that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Light?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān-prasāda:</span> Dr. Sharma suggested that we name introduction as <span class="Italic">Antar-Darśana,</span> because it is the essence of the entire commentary. We have summarized the entire thing into thirty pages. So I thought we can name it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Antar-Darśana?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...for getting a little more clear purposes of the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust we're developing at Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. Would you like to hear what we have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> "First point: To systematically propagate spiritual knowledge to the residents and the visitors of Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. Second point: To propagate the consciousness of Kṛṣṇa, as it is revealed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> and to propagate that Caitanya Mahāprabhu is Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself, as is revealed in <span class="Italic">Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> and the <span class="Italic">Caitanya Bhāgavata.</span> 3) To bring all the members of ā together nearer to Lord Caitanya and thus develop within humanity at large that each soul is a part and parcel of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. 4) To teach and encourage the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement of congregational chanting of the holy names of God given in the teachings of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. 5) To erect temples, schools, colleges, universities, institutes of higher studies, hospitals and other buildings with or for the advancement of the objects of the Trust and to maintain, alter and improve the same, including existing buildings, and to furnish and equip the same. 6) In keeping with the spirit of the previous <span class="Italic">ācārya's</span> vision of <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya-M</span>ā<span class="Italic">dhva sampradāya,</span> to cement relations with all the sister temples of <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya-M</span>ā<span class="Italic">dhva sampradāya</span> under one banner, to solidify preaching the message of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, as desired by His Divine Grace Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda and Śrīla Ṭhākura Bhaktivinoda and all the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> in this line. 7) With a view to achieving the aforementioned purposes and to publish and distribute periodicals, magazines, and other books and other items. 8) To do all such other things for the attainment of the objects of the Trust. 9) Trustee members are appointed lifetime. The members should always be seven. 10) A meeting once a year at Śrīdhāma Māyāpura during Gaura-Pūrṇimā. 11) There should be a chairman, a treasurer, and a secretary elected each year. 12) A quorum of at least five members." Finishes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So these are the points, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that we have... We expanded this. Your original simple point was to form a Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity for developing Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. So we have expanded it into these points if they please Your Divine Grace. We took the ideas mostly from your original points in the..., when you formed the New York corporation, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We used those points and just changed them around a little bit. Today that Jagadish, I forget his name, that lawyer from Mathurā, he is coming, so I'm going to be meeting with him, and I'll give him these points and see if he can draft a document, proper document. I'd like to get a document done in time so that when we go to Māyāpura, and especially at Gaura-Pūrṇimā, we can have the first meeting. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To guide him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I told him, "You're right. Actually Prabhupāda is... All of us were in the same position. We're all unlucky.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we haven't approached anyone yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, he has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, you did approach?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. Like, he just wanted to consult him. Consult him in the sense... At the first place he had to discuss about certain preparations, and he didn't have the books with him, so he wanted to see the books, so I took him there. And then he liked him, talking to him, and he says he's a very efficient person. So he wanted him to come tomorrow, so like when he is not here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How long he will stay here for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Four or five days he agreed to stay. But he says that in four or five days Śrīla Prabhupāda won't be able to travel. It will be at least ten to fifteen days. At that time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, let us see. Maybe we can convince him to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> A bit longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should try. Śrīla Prabhupāda? I had meeting with that lawyer? That man is wonderful. He is the first lawyer I have ever met that I honestly feel is an honest man. That Jagadish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Agarwal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that his name? Agarwal? From Mathurā. Whew! Very high class man, thoroughly gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Noble-minded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We met. Svarūpa Dāmodara and I spent an hour at Bhagatji's house. Bhagatji brought him. So he's going to do that Trust. He says in three or four days time he can finish it, Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust, with the aims and objects we have given. Then I talked about that squandering amendment. So he explained that the best way to do it is that we amend it to say that they always get 250 rupees for their maintenance, and the other 750 rupees, instead of fixing it in their names, fix it in the name of ISKCON, and ISKCON executors of the will shall see that they give them the money at the time of seven years for the purposes of three: purchasing property, business, and for buying government stocks. And the profits from those, they can do anything they want with. He said don't let them put the 750 rupees in their name, because then they can do anything they want with it, squander it. But if you put the money in fixed deposit in ISKCON's name, then ISKCON can give them the money after seven years, for those three purposes. So if you approve, then he can make an amendment clause, and then you can sign it, and then it can be done. He understood everything very perfectly. He said actually... He understood it perfectly. Actually, because everything belongs to ISKCON, the whole will is more or less a moral, spiritual guidance, because legally everything is already ISKCON's. So I said, "But we want it to be morally and guided spiritually. To us, this is the will. Whatever this will says, we must follow as Prabhupāda's disciples." He said, "Then I can make an amendment, which would be like that, that every month they'll get 250 rupees for their whole lifetime, and the 750 rupees will be put in fixed deposit for seven years in the name of ISKCON, and at the end of that, the ISKCON executors of the will, will give them each the money each month, fifteen hundred rupees, for the purpose of..., in those three ways, and that the money should not be squandered." He said that way, if ISKCON sees that the money is being squandered, then they stop giving them that money and they'll just give 250 rupees. Two hundred fifty rupees they must get. And Radharani De, she may get always one thousand rupees. She is older. Let her have that. Whatever she does is her business with the money. And, I think, it is a very good way. And we'll all make sure that they get the money, but they must use it properly. It's Kṛṣṇa's money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they'll remain in that house lifetime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It's a very good house. I spoke to him. I said, "Have you made any friends in that house?" He said, "Oh, they're all..." He called them <span class="Italic">lakhi-pati</span> and <span class="Italic">crore-pati.</span> (Prabhupāda laughs) I said, "So it's very good house. Such big people are living there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said <span class="Italic">lakhi...</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vrindavan. He was saying that they're all big people living there. So I said, "That's good. It means a high class place. You don't move out of there." He said, "It is a good place."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very first class place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is first class. There's no doubt about it. I also got him a plane ticket. I sent a man to Delhi today, and we got the reservation. So he'll be leaving Vṛndāvana tomorrow morning at about 9:30, 9:00-9:30. So I told him that he should come and see you. He'll come in the morning to see you. He was... A couple of time you were sleeping today, so he could not come. Otherwise he was wanting to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you guide him with his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. I told him that you want me to help him in every way, and that there's no doubt we will do that in every way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So about that traveling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Travel exp... I talked to him, and I explained to him that he's taken ten thousand rupees for traveling expenses and twenty-five thousand rupees books, thirty-five thousand rupees, and he's paid six thousand rupees in two years. I said, "This is not good business." So he said, "Then stop the traveling money." I said, "I'll stop it temporarily. You start paying some money. Then again we can give you the money." I said, "We want to give you the money, but do some business first." So he said, "All right." No, he's pretty pleased to get this big amount now for making this contract. This is a big amount that he got, half a <span class="Italic">lakh</span> nearly. From this, he can make more profit, and then he'll pay it back by April, and then we'll give him nine thousand rupees free donation. Each of them gets nine thousand rupees as per your original scheme. So they are being looked to nicely. Actually there's no difficulty. They have very few expenses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kavirāja:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (<span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> chants <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-mantra</span>) (Bengali) (Prabhupāda drinks something) Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Hindi-Prabhupāda, Bhakti-caru, and <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think whatever money you give Vrindavan for business, he'll spoil. He has already spoiled. They are getting, altogether, about two thousand rupees even without any business-his mother, one thousand, and they four, 250 each. So let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and eat and sleep. That's all. He has already spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can call him. I shall tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean that's also my opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I fully agree with you. The fact of the matter is, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he has no head for business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anything he does, he's going to lose the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And his assistant is looting him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He thinks this assistant is his greatest friend. Just like he's leaving on a plane. He's going to arrive Monday morning by eight o'clock in the morning, yet he feels he has to send a telegram to his assistant on a Sunday. I said, "What is the point of sending a telegram? The telegram will reach after you arrive. And even if it doesn't, what is the purpose of sending a telegram?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he has no business friend. He should not be given a farthing. That is my conclusion. And the postal, they should be given to the respective...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As previously planned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can call him. I shall tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I'll just send someone. Practically speaking, when I talk with him, with Vrindavan, I can only think in terms of a charity case, because when I talk to him about business, it's like talking to a young child. He doesn't grasp. I have to tell him the same thing ten times in a row. It's not that he doesn't understand English. He understands English quite all right. But he can't grasp simple business ideas. He's very... He just doesn't have it within him. They should be devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
