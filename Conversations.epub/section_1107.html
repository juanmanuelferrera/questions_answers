<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But our duty is to try. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...according to an official in the Central Railway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how many tickets we have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We've got twenty tickets for the devotees in second-class, plus two for yourself and Hari-śauri in first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Well it's not the consideration of tickets, it's just on the midnight of 31st and 1st. When I was very disturbed, I just got into the train for a drive, being a railway man, and there was just some intuition that I came here and I had your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> On the 3lst and lst. On the lst morning. And from that I... As happens to be, I've been coming every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> On the 2nd you were kind enough to autograph the <span class="Italic">Gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes, I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> ...which I purchased from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> I not started reading that one. I'm reading the <span class="Italic">Śrī... Īśo...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span> I read the other <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> But after I finish this, then I'll start your edition. I have read <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> the ordinary one from Gita Press, Gorakphur. I've read Dr. Radhakrishna in portion, Dr. Rajagopalacarya. I hope to gain something more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difference between other <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> and our <span class="Italic">Gītā...</span> We therefore said, <span class="Italic">"As It Is."</span> No interpretation. That is the disaster. Authority, Kṛṣṇa, and to interpret on His word, this is very disastrous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa has been good to me right from my childhood. I was brought up in a good religious family. I have always been able to have my way. I think that's what's wrong. I get very strong desires, likes, dislikes. I have been successful, very, very successful, in material sense, in work. I want to... Doesn't leave me with peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is your full name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Rabindranath Gupta. I'm not a Bengali. I belong to Delhi. I've lived eight years in Bengal, Citra and then Durgapur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So you can speak in Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> I can understand (exchange few words in Bengali).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bengali is not at all very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> No, not at all. Once upon a time I could read and write. But it's just out of touch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Calcutta Marwaris, they speak very fluently. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Fluently. Being in railways I've had about eight cross-country transfers. Rajkot, Ajmer, Bombay, Ahmedabad, Lohar(?). So I know as much of Gujarati and Marwari too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rajastani?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Rajastani. Hindi is the mother tongue for Rajastani.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hindi is understood everywhere. [break] ...<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> what you have learned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> The only thing that I have been able to learn is we... I was told so, quite.(?) By keeping our mind and heart strict, we should do our work as belonging to best <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> as best as possible. But the human beings tend to twist "as best as possible" in their own way. And that... When the realization comes... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you realize that the modern civilization is misguided? [break] ...is the quintessence of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">. Glāniḥ.</span> The people are misguided. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> He's Dr. Patel. He's Mr. Gupta, a railway officer. He arranged for our tickets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are going by plane or by car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are going also by train? It will be too much strain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first-class is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even first-class. Because it takes more than thirty-six hours to reach...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...by car, by Calcutta from here, no? Or Kashi Express.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Yes, sir. Twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kashi Express?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Kashi Express. Kashi Express reaches in the morning just at one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I had gone by Kashi Express. It reached... From here it starts in the evening, and there it reaches Allahabad in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> That is Allahabad Mail. That's Calcutta Mail. Kashi Express leaves at 6:45 in the morning with other and reaches at the same time next morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to get the train from Dadar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dadar is nearer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It must be stopping at Thana also. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> We had the option of going either on 10th night or 11th morning. But we preferred 11th morning for the same reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 10th night means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> By Calcutta Mail, or there's a special leaving for Allahabad. There's a special train. We are running Kumbhamela specials.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> This one is a regular train. This is Varanasi Express.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A special must not have first-class. Has it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Special has first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That special will be better than.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> No, it won't be because it leaves on 10th night and it will only go to Naini. It won't go to Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Isn't it faster...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it changes. You have to change again. From Naini you have to change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> You see, the Central Railway, we are taking people only to Naini and back. We are moving about a million passengers from this area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From Naini they are going to the Kumbhamela<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Naini, yes. It's a triangle. So from Naini they will go to Kumbhamela, come back to Naini, and come back this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How far Naini is from Allahabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Naini, railway stationwise is five miles from Allahabad, but people want to go to Sangamner just at the bridge at the bank of the river... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not far away from the Sam... It is nearer. Rather, Allahabad main station is far away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> You see, the way railways have organized it, Eastern Railway will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Naini, you are crossing the river or this side of the river?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> By special, we will not cross the river. By through-going trains, we will cross the river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If you cross the river, then you go to Allahabad main station.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> So Varanasi Express will go to main station. That special would not have gone to main station. It would have caused you inconvenience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they will receive from Allahabad station our men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have to tell them to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We'll have to telegram to Gurudāsa to tell when we're coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There will be huge, I mean, traffic blocking and all those things. No? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifty years before, when I was in Allahabad, 1920's, there was Kumbhamela. Then forty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> people came, fifty years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> With poor transport then. That transport was not so efficient as it is today, no? More trains and more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Bombay Mail was there, and I think this Kashi Express was not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kashi Express is a new.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very new. That is also not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> About fifteen years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifteen years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kashi Express goes to Allahabad and comes back to Benares. I have gone by that train.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Actually Kashi Express was introduced before last Kumbhamela.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, Kashi Express goes to Allahabad; then, from Allahabad, there is a straight line from Benares, to Benares. Then it goes to Mugger(?) side. Kashi Express, it goes up to Kashi or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Up to Kashi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And how long are you going to stay there, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As long as Muratdev... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm not going to stay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is very cold, huh? There will be extreme cold this season. And to take bath in confluence in this biting cold of this cold water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes I was taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You should take warm water bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1925 I was taking. I was touching the water, and it was cutting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even my... It was cutting too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) And as soon as I take a dip, everything is warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but for now it is not right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Everything is numb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And immediately warm. As you take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is all the place, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So long as you do not take dip, it is so pinching, it is cutting your body. And as soon as you get a dip, one, two, three-<span class="Italic">bas.</span> Immediately you are warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but now, at this age of your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You should warm the water and take water from confluence, bring in the tent, warm it up and take a bath. Or you get a pot of water here and daily put two drops in the bucket and take bath (laughs). My wife was doing this. She used to put two drops of Gaṅgā water...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, if I take such dip I may be paralyzed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> Oh, yes. One man had actually died in Kashi Benares by dipping in the Gaṅgā. The water in Gaṅgā is very cold even in summer, sir, huh? Summer also is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almost. Because it is coming directly from Himalaya. Up to Prayāga, pure, no mixture. And then Yamunā...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And Gaṅgā mix together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mix together. They say Sarasvatī also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sarasvatī is the subterranean river. They call Sarasvatī everywhere. "Hindu mythological river."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Mythological?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, it is mythological. It is all subterranean water. Here's Sarasvatī. You got Sarasvatī in Gujarat also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is Sarasvatī</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You get Sarasvatī in Maharastra also, everywhere. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> This is Dr. Patel. I heard him speaking two years ago because a tape came. At the time you were, you and Dr. Patel, you were having very heated conversations. But now I see he is subdued. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In these two years I have made an extensive study of the Vaiṣṇava cult, all the three branches of main Vaiṣṇavas, and I think, I think, sir, that... I have studied Śaṅkara also extensively, and I think Śaṅkara is misunderstood very much. That is our opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not misunderstood. He made himself misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they all misunderstand the real purport of his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyāvādam asac...</span> He has to preach this Māyāvāda. He has to present himself in that way. Otherwise he is Vaiṣṇava. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādam asac-chāstraṁ pracchannaṁ bauddham ucyate.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Same with the Vallabhācārya's followers.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Gurujī, the problem which I am putting as a common man is... I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not for the common man. Common man has to learn under the discipline of guru. You cannot expect all these things from a common man. When you actually control all these things then you are not common man. You are representative of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can preach Kṛṣṇa's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is one <span class="Italic">śloka, sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣa...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. This is <span class="Italic">pāpa-kāma,</span> <span class="Italic">krodha</span> and <span class="Italic">lobha.</span> He will relieve you from that <span class="Italic">pāpa</span> if you completely surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pāpa,</span> everything... In the material world, whatever you do, that is <span class="Italic">pāpa.</span> In the material world, "This is <span class="Italic">pāpa,</span> this is <span class="Italic">puṇya</span>"-this is mental concoction. Everything is <span class="Italic">pāpa. Dvaite bhadrābhadra sakali samāna.</span> In the world of duality, material world, we have manufactured something-"This is good; this is bad. This is moral, this is immoral"-but <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta </span> author said, "These are all mental concoction. Everything is the same, material." Material means bad. But we have made some convention-"This is good; this is bad; this is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Gupta:</span> By God's grace I'm a very successful man. I'm youngest chief mechanical engineer on the Central Railway.

But when they overcome in the heat of the moment, they you're not able to retract yourself. It's only when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then... Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, let him. That you have to practice, how to use <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha.</span> That is described by Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-sevā kāmārpaṇe. Kāma</span> means you have a strong desire to do something. That is <span class="Italic">kāma.</span> So convert it, this <span class="Italic">kāma</span> desire, for Kṛṣṇa's activities. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-sevā kāmārpaṇe. Krodha bhakta-dveṣi-jane.</span> And persons who are envious of the devotees, you become angry upon them. You have got this quality, <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, lobha,</span> but you can utilize it. Just like Hanumān. He became very angry, and he set fire in the Lanka. Unless one is very angry, he cannot do that. But that <span class="Italic">krodha</span> was applied to the demon. <span class="Italic">Krodha bhakta-dveṣi-jane.</span> So we can utilize <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, moha,</span> bewilderment. When we cannot find out a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> then we should be bewildered. <span class="Italic">Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvam.</span> So therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> process means that everything has to be purified. <span class="Italic">Krodha,</span> Hanumān's <span class="Italic">krodha</span> to set fire Laṅkā, it is purified <span class="Italic">krodha.</span> But they cannot understand the <span class="Italic">krodha,</span> how it is purified. But <span class="Italic">krodha</span> can be purified. When it is <span class="Italic">bhakta-dveṣi-jane...</span> Those who are envious of God and His devotees, upon them you should be always angry. "No, I have become a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> I cannot become..." Caitanya Mahāprabhu showed by His example. He said, <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena taror api sahiṣṇunā.</span> But when Nityānanda Prabhu was injured, He became so angry, He immediately said, "Bring my <span class="Italic">cakra.</span> I shall kill the Jagāi-Mādhāi." So at that time He's not <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena.</span> That is <span class="Italic">krodha bhakta-dveṣi-jane.</span> So we have this <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, moha,</span> everything, whatever sense activity we have got. When they are utilized for Kṛṣṇa, then it is purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now there is fight... Just like political fight. In the political fight both the parties, they are trying to get supremacy of their own sense gratification. But here the fight, Rāma-Rāvaṇa..., Hanumān's <span class="Italic">krodha</span> was not for himself. He did not want the Laṅkā kingdom. But because Rāmacandra wanted that "This man should be punished," he cooperated: "Yes." So this is spiritual. In this way, when we purify all our activities, all our sensual activities, then it is right. Otherwise... Just like Arjuna. He purified his senses. A Vaiṣṇava is naturally nonviolent, but in order to satisfy Kṛṣṇa he fought. That is purified. So we have to purify. Our activities cannot be stopped. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All activities done for sake of Kṛṣṇa or God are the real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-arthe. Mat-para. Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogam...</span> This is <span class="Italic">yoga. Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ. Yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span> When you take shelter... But these Māyāvādīs<span class="Italic">...</span> Where is <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ?</span> "He is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span>" So there is no <span class="Italic">āśraya.</span> So they cannot perform this yoga because there is no <span class="Italic">mad-āśrayaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Āśraya loiyā bhaje kṛṣṇa tāre nāhi tyāge.(?)</span> If one takes shelter of Kṛṣṇa and he works under His direction, then he's never forsaken or rejected by Him. He's always under the protection of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that should be our duty. We shall act only to the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Then our activities are purified, and then we are liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> That requires guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless guru, how you know? Guru is the representative of Kṛṣṇa. We cannot directly meet Kṛṣṇa at the present moment. So this is called <span class="Italic">vyavasāyātmikā buddhi.</span> If we work under the direction of the representative of Kṛṣṇa, that is perfect. <span class="Italic">Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, āra nā koriho mane āśā</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span> You are singing daily. Whatever guru has said, take it seriously. Don't manufacture your ideas. <span class="Italic">Guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya, āra nā koriho mane āśā</span> **<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> Just as you have given an example of <span class="Italic">krodha</span> by Lord Hanumān in burning Laṅkā, are there any such instances where <span class="Italic">lobha</span> could also be personified Lord Kṛṣṇa's desire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Just like <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> They were always hankering: "When we shall see Kṛṣṇa? When we shall see Kṛṣṇa? When I shall...? When I shall meet?" Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> "Oh, I see everything vacant without Govinda." This is ecstasy of <span class="Italic">lobha,</span> to meet Kṛṣṇa. So when you will be strongly hankering after Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">lobha,</span> greedy, or devotee, then <span class="Italic">lobha</span> is properly utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When Kṛṣṇa disappeared from <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> what they did?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many instances. You can utilize your hankering for Kṛṣṇa and His devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> There's one verse like that, <span class="Italic">ekalaṁ mūlyaṁ lobha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyam. Laulyam,</span> yes, right. That is greediness. <span class="Italic">Laulyam.</span> The verse is by Rūpa Gosvāmī. He advises, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate:</span> "This Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you purchase. If it is available somewhere, immediately purchase it." So the next question is, if you want to purchase something, you must pay the price. So therefore said that "The price is <span class="Italic">laulyam,</span> greediness. How I shall become Kṛṣṇa conscious?" That is price. "How I shall?" Oh, that I can very easily. No. <span class="Italic">Na janma-koṭi-sukṛtair labhyate.</span> "If one has done pious activities for many, many births, he also cannot have this greediness." It is so rare. But if you have got that greediness, you get Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Intense greediness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intense greediness. So one may think, "Oh, I can be very greedy." So the answer is <span class="Italic">na janma-koṭi-sukṛtair labhyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If a human being can try repeatedly, showing <span class="Italic">kāma,</span> <span class="Italic">krodha, lobha, moha...</span> He keeps on trying to get over it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is negative side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...and again keeps on trying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is negative side. First of all... Just like <span class="Italic">mauna...</span> [break] Why <span class="Italic">maunam</span>? There is no need of <span class="Italic">maunam.</span> You have to chant. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanīyaḥ sadā.</span> So there is negative side and positive side. One who has no information of the positive side, they simply take the negative side. <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā. Jagan mithyā</span> is all right, but where is that <span class="Italic">brahma satyam</span>? That <span class="Italic">brahma satyam</span> is here, when you are fully engaged in serving. <span class="Italic">Brahma satyam</span> does not mean I simply make negative this, and there is no engagement. That <span class="Italic">brahma satyam</span> will not endure. You'll fall down, because you are active. If you have no engagement, then you fall down again. Just like a child, he is engaged in playing always, but engage him in studying. If he gets little interest, then automatically he gives up playing. But if you simply stop playing, then he will become mad, because activity is there. These Māyāvādī philosophers, they do not know this. They simply take the negative thing-this material engagement, zero, Buddha philosophy, <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa.</span> And that <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa</span> is another word, <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa.</span> That will not help us. There must be varieties and there must be positive life, and that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> you cannot stop your nonsense activities, neither...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindu) But even you get the same thing by (Hindi). So Vaiṣṇava cult is easier than getting the mind blank and then getting all in the... Because here your mind is engaged to Lord Himself. It is... We call as <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like a man is observing <span class="Italic">Ekādaśī,</span> fasting.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa. And there compulsory fasting, but he has got desire.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Examination or no examination, if you, they practice the rules, that is sufficient examination. Suppose one of the items, that one has to rise early in the morning... So if one is rising early in the morning, then what is the examination? That is already examined. If one has to rise early in the morning, attend the <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> sitting in the class and reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa... These are all practical. There is no need of examination. If he is doing, then it is examination passed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> But the parents want certificate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, if you want to satisfy the parents, the government, then it is not possible. You have to satisfy Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They will not produce so bad leaders perhaps. At least they will have a little better understanding than those fools who have no background of religion at all. Well, your schools, so-called secularism, means no religion.</div>
