<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 19, 1975, San Francisco</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you went to Vṛndāvana, New Vrindaban?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> I associated with Kirtananda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what was the result?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Well, I'm a little bit stronger in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Associating with devotees is a wonderful thing. They are really doing a lot of productive service there. They just put in a new road. The palace, they're putting the arches up today. Everyone's enthusiastic there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You informed him that you are taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> He smiled, said "Very nice." [break] ...Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Gosvāmī that, as you requested, I'd like to join his bus party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What is the position of a soul that's in a sacred tree like a fig tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are also <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa. Sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa</span> is working throughout the universe. [break] ...was attempt to manufacture gold by combination of metals. They are not doing that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, I don't think they're doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They think that that's foolishness. They think that it's a legendary thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Alchemy is not looked upon as very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They've replaced it now with science, higher truth of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not legend. If you can mix copper, tin and mercury-this is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra-</span>you can make gold. It is not legend. The particular metals to be combined, that is stated: copper, tin and mercury. You mix, and there will be gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why aren't they doing it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they do not know the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but some Vedic people, some men who know the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> In India they know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They make gold, some of the yogis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yogis. You once said they swallow some mercury and then they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They swallow mercury overnight, and they pass urine on the copper, and then the copper is put into the fire. It becomes gold. There is same combination, mercury, copper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The only difficulty is that mercury is certain death if you eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore you must know how to eat. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But why don't they... I'm sure the scientists could figure out an easier way than having to swallow it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in Kaviraji, they make some medicine which is gold added by this process, <span class="Italic">makaradhvaja. Makaradhvaja,</span> the medicine which is combination of tin and mercury, and it looks like gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we could become rich if we do this, our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone will do, and there will be no rich men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is it tin and copper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Tin, copper and mercury.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you can try. You are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's brass. That's the constituents of brass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tin and copper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Like bell metal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And add mercury.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is first the metals mixed together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I'll give you all the profits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can give you suggestion. This example is given by Sanātana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Verse">yathā kāñcanatāṁ yāti<br class="calibre2"/>kaṁsyaṁ rāsa-vidhānataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena<br class="calibre2"/>dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛnāṁ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the definition, that "As <span class="Italic">kaṁsa,</span> the bell metal, by manipulating with mercury, it becomes gold, similarly, a person by the process of <span class="Italic">dīkṣā,</span> initiation, be becomes a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This is the example he has given. <span class="Italic">Yathā kāñcanataṁ yāti. Kāñcanatam</span> means gold. <span class="Italic">Rāsa-vidhānataḥ,</span> by process of mercury manipulation. Why he has not taken other metal? This is in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And the scientists-I do not know-they say that some, what is called, molecules? Some molecules added with mercury, it can be turned into gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know why they don't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They are experimenting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have not come to success. So why not make experiment in the laboratory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We should do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Perhaps Svarūpa Dāmodara can do it. Svarūpa Dāmodara is a chemist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I have a lot of tin and brass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Brass you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Would you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you add mercury, then give. The <span class="Italic">kāvirājī</span> medicines, they mix mercury and sulphur, and then tin, and some other medicine, that make <span class="Italic">makaradhvaja,</span> and it looks like gold. <span class="Italic">Svarṇa-sindhu,</span> the name is <span class="Italic">svarṇa-sindhu,</span> "vermillion of gold." That is a medicine. It looks like gold. The some medicine, they mix mercury and sulphuric acid first of all, and then with some other thing. Mercury cannot be directly heated. It must be mixed with sulphuric acid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What happens when it is directly heated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will immediately blow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Sulphuric acid is also poisonous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it blows up as soon as it's heated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, it's not a medicine then. You don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they use as medicine, mercury mixed with sulphur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There was an advertisement that a ten cent piece, a dime, that was minted ten years ago it was made with silver. So that ten cent piece today is actually worth twenty-five cents. And the twenty-five cents piece that they make today, because it's made with copper, it's only worth ten cents. So it's better to have a ten cent piece that was made ten years ago than a twenty-five cent piece that was made today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In the British historical museum in London, I have seen there's a plate about this large, and half of it is pure gold, and the other half is lead. And they found this. They can't explain. It's just a straight line where they separate, and they can't explain how it was produced. So they're experimenting now to try to change lead because there's only, what is it, one proton or electron in the atom? Different. There's only like one proton difference between lead and gold. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the sky there are many big, big planets where the millions of miles made of gold. Just like desert, there is gold desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. We saw coming here a salt desert. There's a whole desert of salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Utaḥ. It's called salt flats. There's a great salt lake. And the lake is gradually drying up. And for miles and miles and miles, simply salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> And the water in that lake is far more salty than the ocean water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You cannot sink in it, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, it's not possible to drown. If you go into the water there, immediately you come up to the surface.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> So much salt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...the ocean of milk, ocean of milk. Ocean of liquor, ocean of oil, ocean of yogurt. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kaṇṭha:</span> ...in the ocean of nectar. The devotees are living in the ocean also. Nectar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</span> The ordinary ocean does not increase, but this ocean increases. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam. Vardhanam</span> means increasing. (dog barks) So they keep also dog? I was thinking there was no dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They're strays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhīra Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many dogs live around this campus, an unusual number, a very large number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in what <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is that recipe given for gold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span> Not recipe. The comparison is there in <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span> Perhaps purposefully the recipe is not given so that you can take and misuse this. (laughter) And forget chanting. Because as soon as you get gold, then you are no more interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the infection of gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But I have gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have gold. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not great quantities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Originally when I came to the movement I asked you this, remember? And you gave lectures on the subject, and I asked you about it. And you asked me for what purpose I wanted it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I don't wonder you. But the gold has got such infection that if one... That is the whole world, that as soon as one has gold, he is no more interested with God. That is the infection. "Ah!" He will say, "This is meant for the poor class of men who has no gold. I have gold. I am God." You know that Kali-yuga. He was punished, that "You get out." Then he said that "Where shall I go? Everywhere is your kingdom." Then Parīkṣit Mahārāja said that "You go here, in the brothel, in the..., these four things." <span class="Italic">Striyaḥ śūna-pānā dyutāḥ yatra pāpāś catur-vidhāḥ:</span> "Illicit sex, and slaughterhouse, and liquor shop, and gambling." Then he requested that "Instead of going so many places, you give me some place where one place will be sufficient." Then he said, "You go where there is gold. Then you get everything." <span class="Italic">Striyaḥ śūna-pānā dyutāḥ yatra pāpāś catur-vidhāḥ.</span> Formerly, especially in Bengal, the gold merchants are taken as-that is artificial, of course-the low class because they are rich, and they indulge in these four kinds of prohibition. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
