<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It will be covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Covered, but now it is corroding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I see what you are saying. There is another door that goes in that wall there, like this, for access to that side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> Little service in this connection, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, can protect one from the greatest danger. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You are so kind to let us do it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the seaside, sea beach? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, they call it silica sand. I think it's made from glass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not glass, it is a kind of stone made powder. Silica sand. They are like sandstone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is just the first cut, not polished. Now, in this dome you see this is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, while constructing, filling up this, what is called, column, in Bombay, they're putting air so that they become solid stone. You have seen in Bombay? Big engineer, they are giving some pumping air so that while the cement is filled up, it becomes solid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, vibrators.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We also do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got some machine?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. And we'll take you down to the gray house down here, we'll show you a few more things, how it's being finished. It is just rough here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are these pipes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That's for drainage. For when the water goes out into the sewer, and goes out into the field and drains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can utilize this water for fertilizing, drain water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Well, first of all, we have to satisfy the health department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...wood as fuel so that gradually this jungle will be clear. Thank you very much.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> For some time anyway. While we are building so much we need some help. We do not have sufficient manpower. No one is idle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja, you like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very wonderful. (out of car, entering a room)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to take our shoes off?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It's OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are specially made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Yes, special for you, in New York City, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> These pictures are rose quartz. This is rose quartz and twenty-four-carat gold.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Twenty-four karat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In that Detroit house, so much gold. That is also like this. What are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is a sample of the handles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Plumbing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Like those on the doors. But we are just <span class="Italic">śūdras</span>; we don't know how to do anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. What for these marbles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That will go on the wall in the bathroom, Italian cremo marble. Here's a picture of how the windows are being done in <span class="Italic">jāli</span> work. This is being cast out of white cement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doing here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. This is some of the castings they've done. This goes up on the ceiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cornice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Cornice, yes. Then around the top of the building on the outside, there's a railing with these balusters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is made of cement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, this one is plaster, this was our first model, but the ones that will be used will be done out of cement. This is very light. Do you have your drawing of the outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody's staying here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, Bhāgavatānanda and a couple of the other construction members stay here. [break] This is the way it will look when it's finished-the balusters and the brackets supporting the sunshade. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...When God is there, within the heart, He'll give you, "Do like this." <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi taṁ yena mām upayānti te.</span> If one is sincere to serve the Lord, the Lord is situated in everyone's heart, He'll give him, "Do like this." <span class="Italic">Teṣām evānukampārtham aham (indistinct)</span> [Bg. 10.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is special favor of God. Even if he's less aware of everything to be arranged(?), He'll give instruction, "Do like this." So there is no scarcity of instruction if one is sincere. Thank you very much. (leaves house) [break] ...I came to your country for preaching this, I had no idea how to do it. (laughs) But things are being model. People are surprised how within a short so many short years this world movement has sprung. I had no idea how to do it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Seeing your palace here is almost like seeing the Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple for the first time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In Raman Reti there was no temple. Similarly, in this quarter there was no such building. Many people will come to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They already do, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, I can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Many people come by every week to see what progress has been made. And everybody who drives by, they stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is something wonderful in this quarter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You can drive fifty miles away around here and they'll stop and ask you about how's the palace coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Changing New Vrindaban. It is already organized, New Vrindaban? (in car:) Little further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We're trying to clear all this now too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is ours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It takes a long time to clear it, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. Do slowly, that is pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Well, we could do it much faster if we didn't try to utilize the wood, but we want to utilize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unnecessarily you should not cut. When it is necessary for Kṛṣṇa, then you cut. This is also living entity. We cannot kill them without any sufficient reason. (sings) <span class="Italic">Śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya.</span> This is our property?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All this land can be planted. There is some graveyard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. You want to ride any further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> ...can be seen in one direction at least a couple of miles away, several, no, three directions. This is the capital that will go in the courtyard here in the assembly area. On those columns, this will go at the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. Thank you. This is plastic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is what they make the mold from. This one is in plaster. Now they will cast more. Below that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can do Deity also, they can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, after they've done with your palace they're going to start on some Deities. I think they would like permission to first start with your Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Kulaśekhara is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Kulaśekhara, yes, he is editing <span class="Italic">Brijabasi Spirit</span> now. We will put a wall around and then all nice gardens inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cement wall or wooden?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, a combination of masonry and fancy iron so that people can see through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reinforced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, but also so they can see through at certain points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> With sunshine this wood becomes very, very beautiful. <span class="Italic">Tapo-vana.</span> [break] ...in this house. Who is staying now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Usually there are devotees that stay there. Right now we are not having anybody stay there. Lord Jagannātha stays there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Here, in this house? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> What is that? No, Jagannātha stays in that house. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...are grown here or brought from somewhere else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This was brought from somewhere else because there was nothing here in which to grow it. We can grow it. That's why it's so wet right now, very wet. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will do it like this, now it is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one girl is taking care, she's doing very nice. We can sit down here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Kulādri, find some more (indistinct). Come up this side. As soon as <span class="Italic">you</span> sit down, everything looks complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? (laughs) Where is Pradyumna Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> He's just inside the house. You'd like him to come out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Pālikā, you came before here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Six years ago. There was just that one small, original farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is a big property. And when the palace will be ready, many people will.... You simply advertise "Come and see palaces in New Vrindaban." It will be a combination of Western and Eastern culture. For the profit of the whole human society. So Vṛndāvana-candra will come here? No. Vṛndāvana-candra Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His palace will be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> His palace will be where the building is now. We're planning to move Him into the new building next to the present temple, the four-story building. He will occupy the fourth floor for now. Then we will take down that old building and put up a nice big temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you dismantle, construct another?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The building is not in such good condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. As soon as the new temple is, move it; or you want to dismantle it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The site is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, site is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It will make a nice complex in relationship with the other buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will.... Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We are about to install your <span class="Italic">mūrti</span> in that temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau</span> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> The Vedic secret(?) is that, <span class="Italic">parā bhaktir, yasya deve,</span> unto the Lord, similarly, to the <span class="Italic">guru,</span> they, to them, the whole thing becomes revealed automatically. Vedic knowledge is grasped not by erudite scholarship. Mundane scholarship has nothing to do. The secret is <span class="Italic">yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.</span> My Guru Mahārāja wanted that some books should be published. So I tried my best, and he's giving success more than expectation. In the history nobody has sold religion, philosophical books in such large quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are all Guru Mahārāja's blessings. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura is stressing on this point,</div>
<div class="Verse">guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete kariyā aikya,<br class="calibre2"/>āra nā koriha mane āśā **</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Simply execute that. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhakti, kṛṣṇa prāpti haya yāhā haite.</span> You'll get Kṛṣṇa. (long pause) [break] Govinda, Gopīnātha, Madana Mohana, Śyāmasundara, Rādhā-Dāmodara, Gokulānanda, and...? Rādhā-Ramaṇa. The same thing, Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava. Then other Vaiṣṇavas came, Raṅganātha, Rāmānuja. [break] ...devotees from India, we import to develop these quarters, will government allow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I don't think there's as much trouble from our government as from the Indian government. Our problem so far has been Indian government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difficulty? If somebody wants to go, migrate in America, what India government will do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They won't give them passport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, passport means coming back. But if he's going to domicile, Indian government cannot check. If I want to go somewhere and live there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You have to have passport. As far as I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But passport means if he wants to return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, in other words, in order to get visa from US, you have to present your passport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are different kinds of visa. Immigration visa. Suppose if anyone wants to migrate in America, our society here, we give guarantee. I think there will be no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No difficulty. We can try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our society is here, and we give this man our guarantee for maintenance. So what is the objection? By law there is no objection. And if the immigration department allows, "Yes, you can come and live," then where will be...? Immigration means that here government should be satisfied that this man is coming, he will have no difficulty, government gives permit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Should be like that, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is (indistinct). Similarly, you can bring some men from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We would like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they also will be very pleased. India is now so congested. If they get food.... Especially many East Bengalis who migrate in West Bengal for the troublesome condition there, they'll be very happy here. You can write to Gopāla to inquire that we require here some Indians to come to help us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Mistris</span> for construction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mistri</span> or anyone, to develop this Kṛṣṇa culture, so the Society will give guarantee. Why not take permission? And they may not come back. They may reside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> I don't understand. That seems to be the government's, the Indian government's objection was that they wouldn't come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are disturbed with overpopulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It doesn't make any sense. But their objection was that they might not come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is good for you, because you are harassed by overpopulation. You cannot feed them even. Why you object? Let them go and live somewhere else peacefully. Just like the Europeans came here. Originally, in America, Europeans came. Because it was overcongested and they got..., Columbus found this land, enough, and they migrated. So still there is so much land. The Indians are hard workers, they will develop very nicely. Just like this quarter; if Indians would be allowed, they'll come and make it very nice. In South America, they have done. Many Indian cultivators, they have come in remote villages. This cooperation should be. Everything belongs to God. Why a class or community should be congested? Just like China, Japan, India, so much congested. What is this nonsense United Nations doing? What they have done for the last thirty years? No liberal-minded. Let them propose that wherever there is enough land and wherever there is overpopulation, let them go and the government give them simply land and let them work and be happy. Why not arrange, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, arrange between these two, United Nations. Why a section of people is rotting in a place and devising some means how to fight with the others and get land? Why? There is no meaning. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> This is our philosophy, everything belongs to God, and everyone is a son of God; therefore the son of God has the right. Why they should be thrown together and live compulsorily in that rotten place, that in China they are living on the sea? You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Taiwan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Thailand, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. They have no place to live on the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They build boats and live on the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially if people are coming for agriculture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Agriculture is the noblest profession. Give him some land, he cuts the wood, makes cottages. The land is clear, now till it, keep cows and grow foodgrains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Doesn't put any local men out of work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simple thing. And then live comfortably, eat comfortably, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Comfortably does not mean satisfaction of the senses. Comfortably means we require primary necessities, to eat something, to sleep somewhere or have some sex-this is also bodily need-and to defend, that's all. These are the primary necessities. That can be arranged anywhere. God has given all facilities. Grow your own food, eat, and live anywhere. Just this place was rough like that, now it is handled nicely, it is very attractive. (Bengali) Any damn place, you cleanse it, it becomes home. And any nasty man, you decorate him, he becomes a bridegroom. (laughs) (Bengali) (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Let Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement give this sense to these rascals. They do not know how to adjust things. They simply plan their United Nations, but they do not know what is that plan. Yes. United Nations. First of all why nation? Why manufacture nation and create trouble and again ununited? Nation-this word is not there in the Vedic language. There's no conception of nation. There is conception of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> everywhere. Not for any particular nation or any particular country, but everyone, according to quality-first-class men, second-class men, third-class men. That is there everywhere. Everywhere you go, you find some people first-class intelligent, some people less than him, some people less than him, up to fourth class, that's all. And then fifth class. So everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now you try to implement. Perfect human life. Let any sociologist, politician come forward. We shall convince them that this is only way. Why you are wasting time and barking dog in the United Nations for the last forty years and doing nothing? What I said, barking dogs? You have read it? I accused them as barking dogs, Melbourne, and they published in the paper. Actually, this is the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Barking for the last thirty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Nobody has criticized them. They have taken it seriously; otherwise, why they have published? Yes, that's right. What they have done except barking? "I am American," "I am Russian," "I am this," "I am that," that's all. If you keep them dogs and hogs and, nicely dressed, they go to United Nations and talk of unity, is it possible? Can the dogs and hogs can unite? Common sense. You bring all the dogs of this neighborhood and ask them "Don't bark now. Live peacefully," (laughter) will they be able? (laughs) The United Nation is like that. They're kept as dogs and they're advised, "Now keep peacefully." Is it possible? They have no common sense even. First of all, let them become human beings. Conference is going on, big conference, and Jawaharlal Nehru has imitated, that in the conference there are different languages, different..., but if somebody is speaking in any language you'll hear it in your own language. Remember? In New Delhi he has done that. This rascal thought, "Now I am finished, I have done my duty." All rascals. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Thus our definition, that anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's either in these four groups, <span class="Italic">bas,</span> final. You just try to prove it. Hm? Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja? You have any doubt about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone?</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Do it very nicely. Push Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement vigorously. If you keep the people in ignorance like dogs and hogs, what is the value of advancement of knowledge? So many universities? But discuss this point, our charge, explain to them, and let someone defend them, someone talking for, and let him decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether this is fact. It is fact, but even if we do not accept it, what is the wrong there, find out. We don't find any wrong, everything. Because Kṛṣṇa said it, then it's all right. Because they will say it is too sectarian, that anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he's the most miscreant, sinful and ass and lowest of the mankind; he has lost his all knowledge. This is our accusation. Now defend. Any gentleman will protest that "I am such a respectable gentleman, and because I do not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then I'll fall amidst these groups? What is this?" They will say. Now you'll have to prove, that "You are not a gentleman."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Gentleman means one who is cultured. So culture is not of the body but of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what do you mean by culture? First of all, the question will be "What do you mean by culture?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's some idea of progress involved, advancement of life. Otherwise, there's no need for any kind of progress. One remains as a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Culture means advancement in knowledge. We say, "You're a gentleman of culture." That means he's advanced in knowledge. So what is the advancement of knowledge? Next question will be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rakṣaṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa told Arjuna that that was to know that he was factually not his body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is advancement of knowledge. Otherwise, what is the difference between this bird and the human being? He's also dancing very jolly, but he has no knowledge that he's not this body. So if the human being also remains falsely jolly without any knowledge of his existence, then what is the difference between these birds, dogs and human beings? Why we say low grade, animals? He's living in his own way. He has got all the facilities of eating, sleeping, sex and defense. Just you have all the same things. Where is the difference between you and him? Why you say advanced in knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rakṣaṇa:</span> Nowadays they say that they're advanced in knowledge even without any sophistication at all, while Arjuna, when he was giving his arguments to Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, don't bring Arjuna now. Just speak on commonsense platform. As soon as we bring Arjuna, they think it is sectarian. We are talking on human common sense. What is advancement of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say if it's advancement of knowledge, if they are advanced, why do they have to die? The animals are dying, and they're accepting that, and the human beings also die. But why does he have to die if he's advanced in knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rakṣaṇa:</span> Even if you are advanced in knowledge, you still have to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Advancement of knowledge is to distinguish between what is temporary and what is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Discuss on further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They may say though that even the human beings, the necessities are there, eating, sleeping, mating and defending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is doing. What is your advancement of knowledge? The bird is chirping, dancing, they're living, they are sleeping, they have got sex. So everyone is doing. What is your advancement of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We carry out these activities in relationship with the eternal soul. So that by performing the activities one is gaining knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Provided you have got the knowledge of the soul, then you are advanced than the birds and beasts. Otherwise, where is the advancement? <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> The human beings, they can inquire about the spirit soul. These birds, beasts, they cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Then we find so many purported religious people. Just like Christians, they may say "Well, I believe in the soul," but nonetheless they are going on with their materialistic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you do not know seriously what is soul. You have simply an idea, but you do not know in detail. Just like they say, the Christians, "God is great." But they do not know who is God and what is the meaning of greatness. That they do not know. They accept this theoretically or religious sentimentally, "God is great." Just like your state says, "In God We Trust." As soon as I inquire what kind of trust and to whom, there is no reply. That means they do not know what is God, what is trust. As a matter of slogan they write, that's all. Even the state heads, and what to speak of the nonsense ordinary citizens. Seriously taking, it is very important question. They should have reply. But they do not know how to reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> With all of the situations that take place in the material world, they may not be able to see how God is actually active in the material world, that whether there's a war or whether...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that you should.... Why you should remain in ignorance how God is acting? If you are serious about God, then you must know. Just like a statesman, he knows how government is acting. Ordinary man, he knows government is acting, but he does not know how government is acting. But advanced in knowledge, they know what is the constitution, how the government is acting. That is the difference. Therefore lawyer is appointed when there is some trouble. He can find out where is the defect. That is advancement of knowledge. (end)</div>
