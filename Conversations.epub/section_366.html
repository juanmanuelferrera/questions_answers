<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Self-help, self-help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They're distributing in every house, how to benefit in the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But if it is right for them, why not have films in every house and grow your food also? That is not possible every time on the way. You have got to have a... This is a highly developed society. So you have got to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because now it is developed, it is so developed that there is no food. It is so developed that there is no food. One devotee of goddess Durgā, he was a worshiper of goddess Durgā. So Mother Durgā was asking, "My dear son, you are happy?" "Oh Mother! In all respects. Except in two things: there is no food, there is no cloth. That's all. Otherwise I am very happy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So the main thing is not that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) So your, your advancement means advancement in everything, but there is no food, there is no cloth. That's all. This is the advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When there was no rain here last year... No? Year before last. (Hindi) The men in the medical college were talking, "Why the hell do you want rain?" I said "What nonsense, you are talking?" "We don't want. Our fields are in America. The rain is falling there all right." You know, jokingly. (laughs) There is no other... "Why do you want rain here?" Because people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Rain, rain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But they won't, won't perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. And <span class="Italic">yajña</span> means there is service to the humanity...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "That is giving service to Kṛṣṇa," you'll say. "But humanity is Kṛṣṇa," I say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then we quarrel! So we stop there. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Wrong, wrong fully is not <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is wrong fully? Everyone is trying. The state is trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything is God. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ kratur ahaṁ yajñaḥ ahaṁ ghṛtam.</span> "Everything I am." That is Kṛṣṇa, no? And in the very next verse He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But when there is remembrance of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aham.</span> That <span class="Italic">"aham"</span> must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the name of God, you do, and you forget that you are doing. Two things, that is <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> That you are not the performer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not... No, you cannot, you cannot manufacture <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> The <span class="Italic">yajña-vidhi</span> is there. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas, śāstras.</span> You cannot say that "I am doing for God. That is <span class="Italic">yajña." Yajña-vidhi. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na sukhaṁ sa avāpnoti</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> He cannot get happiness if he derides <span class="Italic">śāstra, yajña-vidhi.</span> You cannot manufacture <span class="Italic">yajña-vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa's life itself was a <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then there was no need of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Anyone can manufacture his <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña.</span> But the very life of Kṛṣṇa was a <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> He said that. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ yajñaḥ. Ahaṁ kratur aham ajyam...</span> What is that? I forgot that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ yajña,</span> but who is following Kṛṣṇa? That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He follows, you follow, I follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You follow, I follow means I follow Kṛṣṇa. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means nobody follows. Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Who is doing that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Here <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means all actions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means occupational duties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Actions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Duty. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "You give up all other actions and do actions for Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> does not mean so-called some religious fanaticism. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means occupational duty. Just like you are medical man. You have practiced medical <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Medical <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I went yesterday early, after quarreling. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all right. No, that's all right. One must... Just like Arjuna. Arjuna was a fighter. His <span class="Italic">dharma</span> was to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) Fighter... I am wrongly placed in the medical profession. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means one's <span class="Italic">sva-kar...</span> Just like <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. According to <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The greatest gift to the humanity is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> by the ancient culture of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is given by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Whatever it is... But I mean, that is the greatest gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> And I don't know why people don't follow it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no guidance. There is no guidance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even imperceptibly one <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> may be following, is followed by western countries. They have got all the (indistinct) though they are not putting on (indistinct) and all. (Hindi) But presently this is, we are living in Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. Varṇāśrama-dharma</span> is there, but it is not organized. <span class="Italic">Varṇa...</span> Because it is made by God, <span class="Italic">mayā sṛṣṭam,</span> it cannot be violated. So... But it (is) in a perverted way. Therefore we are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But in old days, I think, this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> was followed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Strictly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am reading the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Therein so many princes turned into <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> and so many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> turned into <span class="Italic">daityas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was by action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Guṇa, guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> Not by birth. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma.</span> Just like you are <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> but because you have acquired the qualification of medical man and you are working as a medical man, therefore you are medical man. Nobody asked you, "You are a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" You are a medical man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Medical... You know, I think medical work is it brahminical or śūdric also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall consider later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) 'Cause I'll not say now so that I will drive out my doubt about me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is half<span class="Italic">-brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, that is all right. At least, little <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is <span class="Italic">vaidyic.</span> All <span class="Italic">vaidyas</span> are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, <span class="Italic">vaidyas</span> means father <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> mother <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">vaidya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are <span class="Italic">sūtas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sūtas</span> are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> mother and father, father <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> These <span class="Italic">sūt...</span> No? Those <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> were <span class="Italic">sūtas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Sūtas</span> means carpenter. <span class="Italic">Śūdra.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...government minister, he has frankly said that "We do not want you to grow here." You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who is that minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Home Minister, Havas(?), in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government is against our movement. Because they are teaching: "Drink wine, eat meat," and we are teaching no meat-eating. How they will approve of our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not only that. We have just now talked about teaching meat. This government of Maharashtra has created an institution, government institution, which are feeding pigs for selling, meat, and poultry. It could have been done by any private institution outside. Why, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't know why they... So they are all <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> these, these <span class="Italic">daityas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> They are less than <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Actually, they are the relatives of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mleccha.</span> They have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata: mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ. Mlecchas,</span> they will assume as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> government. <span class="Italic">Mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ. Bhakṣayiṣyanti prajās te mlecchā rājanya-rūpiṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These fellows created such a horrible state. They actually broke down the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why? Why? Why? What, what wrong these boys are doing to them? If any wrong is done to them, it is done by me because I am giving so much botheration to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is that wrong that we are preaching no meat-eating, no intoxication. We are the greatest criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, not that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who is accepting they are? They are still getting votes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They'll not get vote now. That Dundubhi said they'll not get. Dundubhi... No, they will not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) The people have so much opposed them now, the present government, I think there will be right government next election. The election itself is a sort of great, I mean, mockery committed on the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That I always said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It's a demagogy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... (Hindi) The votes given by some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ignorant people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...ignorant people. What is the value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, if you go in the assembly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly a king was elected by great sages, saintly persons, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> King was elected. And as soon as he deviated from the śāstric principles, he was kicked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right. But we don't want to follow that (indistinct) <span class="Italic">rāma-rājya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then suffer! Then suffer! If your patient does not follow your instruction, he must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And this institution is going to die. This government, this Congress government, is going... I think the world over this is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is world over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> this robbing(?) even in America or England or in Continental countries also. The same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The other countries, they were never following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Worst are these Muslim countries. They kill each other and come into the power. Still they are following their forefathers. They are faithful to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We should go there. And here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A little more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I am trying to associate with them because here is a guru who is trying to spread the real religion to the foreign countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sometimes I don't, I mean, they don't like me. Because I am a man who talks non..., sometimes like a Patel. But still I love them because they are <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> and you know we must love some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is a poetry, Cowper: "England, with all thy faults, I love you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. They may not be liking me because sometimes I am very much opposing them, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also loving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I tell you that this institution should be allowed to flourish so that your culture will spread the world over. Today, today the world is actually languishing under the wrong influence of the wrong culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Now Americans are seriously considering about this movement. There are so many writings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are... As a matter of fact, you are improving their lot. The present boys, in American universities, they are all LSD smokers. The other day I said that, and that boy said that LSD went from India and so I became violent. Forgive me. I felt sorry later on. Because I should not have expressed my temper before you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But I held in a little more temper than that also. When somebody tells a wrong thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this <span class="Italic">gañjā, gañjā</span> went from here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That, because it is produced in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they made a chemical composition of <span class="Italic">gañjā.</span> That is LSD.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no. LSD is not chemical. It is a synthetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore similar effect. Because they are scientific. So instead of importing <span class="Italic">gañjā</span> from India, they invented some chemical composition...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) out of these boys. They smoke even in the classrooms, in their residences...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...in their university camps and everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is going to be legalized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Smoking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Just like they have legalized the prostitution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anything... Because it is vote. Majority wants. "All right. Make it legalized."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All, they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing here even. Majority wants to be godless. So government is following that. Therefore they are against our movement. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Jaya. Namaskāra.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now the <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> Majority wants to become drunkards. "All right, it is legalized." Majority wants prostitute hunters. "All right. It is legalized." This is government. No consideration of morality or religion. Majority wants, it must be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but, I mean, it is all... It must fall. There is no culture. This is a total degeneration of the humanity at large.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They must suffer. And they're suffering. Still, they're blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So-called followers of Christianity actually killing Christ every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why do you take Christianity? Everyone. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but they are majority. They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone. Your Hindus also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have degenerated because we have been ruled by foreigners for so many years. But these fellows, being so free in thinking and doing things, they...</div>
