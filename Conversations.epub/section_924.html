<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also inhabitable. Where you are going? Take it in writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now they are putting out the same kind of propaganda about Mars that formerly they were putting out about the moon-that there may be life-so that they can use that as an excuse to go. I just read a little bit where they say that due to information sent back by the last spaceship that they sent to Mars, now they think that there's more water vapor in the atmosphere than they at first thought. So that means that there's a good possibility that there may be some bacterial life on Mars. So (laughs) they don't... And then they state that the temperature ranges from-130 to +40 degrees farenheit. So that means that there could be life there in a bacterial form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why there is no life in moon planet? Some scientists say the temperature is two hundred degrees less than the zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, at night when they said, because there's no atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why these rascals say it is full of dust, and how from the dust so much light is coming, illuminating the whole universe? What is their logic? They have already brought the dust. That dust does not illuminate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they say just like when the sunlight hits the earth, then the earth appears very bright from outer space. It appears very illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the scientists' excuse. They showed some pictures taken from outer space that shows the earth glowing very brightly, like the moon. So they say in the same way when the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the glow of the surface of the earth does not illuminate? It does not come between illumination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like when the sun is here everything is bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, when the sun is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The moon is actually illuminating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it does not illuminate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They only say it reflects the sunlight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kick their face with shoes. That is the only reward for them. And foolish persons accepting. Just like sun is illuminating. It doesn't require illumination from any other planet. Similarly, if earth is also illuminating, why does it require moonlight in darkness? This common sense does not come into the brain of these rascals who believe that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They put their scientific reasoning to explain the different things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their scientific reasoning? Talking like fools and rascals? If something is illuminating, why extra illumination required to illuminate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their theory is that there's a dark side of the moon that we've never seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their theory is that there's a dark..., that actually the moon is reflecting the sun's light. So there's a dark side of the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far the world is, where is the dark side and the bright side? If you compare like that, then so far this globe is concerned, which one is dark side, which one is bright side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they say the earth is spinning on its own axis, so all parts of the earth at one time or another receive sunlight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The moon does not do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The moon does not revolve on its own axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just to fit their speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Simply speculation and misleading people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no basis for it, there's no truth to it at all. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you people believed that? I'm surprised. (laughter) You are also fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is what they teach in all the schools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have little models, Śrīla Prabhupāda, made out of plastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, they are... Let them, we take them as rascals, that's all. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That other argument that you use about how the moon rays give life to the vegetables... So how is it that there's no life on the moon? If the rays from the moon give life, then how is it there's no life where the rays come from?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have never gone to moon. (laughs) All bogus. And this Mars expedition will be a failure. Let them spend millions of dollars. I told about moon planet ten years ago. It is childish, simply a waste of money and energy. I told this. Now it has proved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no more interest in the moon at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No? Kīrtanānanda said "It is inhabitable." Ten years ago I said there's no use going there. It is childish, waste of money. But who hears about us? We know moon planet is inhabited by high-class living entities. (laughs) (sarcastically:) And they will allow these rascals to go by their machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When they originally started sending sputniks to the moon, they couldn't even land them properly. They would crash, they said that they were crash-landing spaceships into the moon's surface.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Crashed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Crash-landing. The spaceship was supposed to just smash into the surface of the moon, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have never gone. Simply propaganda. Even they have gone, what is the result? Simply with big report that it is inhabitable. (Prabhupāda is eating something:) What is this fiber? Finding? What are other things are there in the... Hmm? What is this? (Hari-śauri laughs) Hmm? Do they add anything more? Something reddish there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes there's a few bugs in it. (laughs) There's some..., it's probably some strands from the mango, fiber from the mango.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they add mango?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, sometimes they put different fruits in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Little oranges in there. You can put orange?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Strawberry and mango and this and that. They make it with some kind of ice cream machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? This is not from machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, this is from machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> You first made ice cream in New York, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Someone told me that in 26 Second Avenue, did you make..., you made them ice cream when it was very hot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It was hot, no, the weather was hot, so you made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can make ice cream in this, what is called, refrigerator. You can make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just make thick cream and put it in the fridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Ice" cream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Prabhupāda speaks some gibberish). Big, big words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They put everything in language. Then everyone is fooled. No one knows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Speak as many big words as possible and don't make any point at all, and then everybody will proclaim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So gradually they'll go up to Saturn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If the money holds out. Actually, they've already sent some exploring rocketships way out to Saturn years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Takes several years to reach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's such a bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How long does it take them to go to Mars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Mars and Venus also, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Venus is the other one they concentrate... They think that Venus, there's a good chance there may be some life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Venus is covered by clouds. So no one can see what is there. There's clouds all around the planet. Heavy, what do they call, so that no one can see. So they sent a rocket inside or something to go through the clouds to see what is there. Russians also tried. Fermament. In the <span class="Italic">Bible,</span> they say that on earth there was also..., above the earth there were all clouds at one time according to the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> And then at that time men used to live very, very long, and then the clouds went away at some point. They call it a firmament. So the same thing is on Venus. No one can see what the planet is like, no one has ever known. That is also a heavenly, we say also... That is Śukrācārya's place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Śukrācārya's, just Śukra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Just Śukra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May be Śukrācārya's place. What benefit they will have? Nothing. This is science. Without any aim, without any objective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What they're doing is entirely pointless. There's no proper reason for any of it. Because they aren't improving their actual living standards by it. They are... It's just like a <span class="Italic">jñāni,</span> he thinks advancement of knowledge, just to simply acquire any amount of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> They are described: <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span> Simply works hard simply to know things. No benefit. These rascals are like that. <span class="Italic">Kevala-bodha-labdhaye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the futility of the university system now. They are going and they're accumulating knowledge which is worthless for living. It has no practical value, so all the youth are becoming very frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any sane man will be frustrated. Why you are spending money and going there? <span class="Italic">Kevala-bodha-labdhaya, kliśyanti kevala, bhaktim.... Kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye teṣām asau kleśala eva śiṣyate nānyad yathā sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām.</span> Just like the husk... The outer portion of rice? If there is rice, you husk, beat it, rice will come. The rice is not there, simply husk, what is the use of this beating? It is like that. Rice will not come, simply they are trying to beat it. So the result is they become tired, that's all. They only result is they'll become tired. <span class="Italic">Kleśala eva śiṣyate,</span> that's all. The result of hard labor is tiresome. So they'll get that only, that's all. They are satisfied, "Now we are tiresome, let us sleep." What you have gotten? "Dust." That's all. This is the philosophy. <span class="Italic">Bhaktim,</span> what is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? That's not it. <span class="Italic">Kleśala, kleśala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Kleśadikataras, kleśa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye teṣām asau kleśala eva śiṣyate nānyad yathā sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Any process you accept, rejecting devotional service, the result will be that there is no profit. You simply labor for nothing, as much as to beat the husk, you'll never get the rice, you will simply be tiresome, that's all. Just like so-called religion. There is no faith in God. There is no need of God, and "religion." This is nonsense. Religion means without God? This is going on. God, you can accept anyone, Ramakrishna Mission. Any rascal...He was a fool, illiterate rascal, Ramakrishna. He became God. No standard, and they are propagating Ramakrishna Mission. As we are preaching Kṛṣṇa is God, they are preaching Ramakrishna. And who's accepting them? For the last hundred years, they are preaching. So who has become a devotee of Ramakrishna?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's absurd to even think about becoming a devotee of Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I think it is Tenth Canto. <span class="Italic">Śreyaḥ śrutiṁ bhaktim?</span> I've been making a list of all the verses that you quote most.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śreyaḥ śrutiṁ bhaktim udasya te vibho<br class="calibre2"/>kliśyanti ye kevala-bodha-labdhaye<br class="calibre2"/>teṣām asau kleśala eva śiṣyate<br class="calibre2"/>nānyad yathā sthūla-tuṣāvaghātinām<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 10.14.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is note?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhaktiṁ vinā jñānaṁ tu naiva siddhyed ity aha (indistinct) śreyaḥ śrutim iti; śreyasam abhyudayāpavarga-lakṣanānaṁ sṛtiḥ śaraṇaṁ, yasyaḥ sarasa iva nirjharanam, taṁ te tava bhaktim udasya tyaktvā śreyasaṁ mārga-bhūtam iti vā; teṣāṁ kleśalaḥ kleśa evāvaśiṣyate.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply tiresome, that's all. Religion, no God. There are so many religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Soon as they forget the actual religion then there are so many concoctions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "This is our religion." What is religion? "No God." What is religion? Then, those who are godless, they have got religion. Atheism has got religion. Then why bring this religion? What is the meaning of religion? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> One time we went to a church in Boston to speak. They had only a pulpit for the preacher, and behind, no altar, no crucifix, nothing, just big map of outer space with planets on the wall. Not even any Christian church, but no cross, nothing. Only universe. Universalist Church, it's called. The Universalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, but give some information of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Says, "Religion: 1. monastic condition, being a monk or a nun, enter into a monastic order; 2. practice of sacred rites; 3. one of the prevalent systems of faith and worship, i.e. Christian, Muhammadan, etc.; 4. human recognition of superhuman controlling power and especially of a personal God entitled to obedience, effect of such recognition on conduct and mental attitude."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is religion. Personal conception of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And then "5. action that one is bound to do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything is there. Any one of them you take. That's good idea, but special conception of personal God, huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Human recognition of superhuman controlling power and especially of a personal God entitled to obedience."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all, clear. What are the other items?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Then, "the effect of such recognition on conduct and mental attitude." And then "action that one is bound to do."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One is bound to do. <span class="Italic">Dharmena hina paśubhiḥ samana.</span> If he does not do, then he's animal. It must be done. There is no question of optional. If you are human being, you must be religious, you must recognize the supreme controller. Otherwise, you are animal. What is the other interpretations? Beginning one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Monastic condition, being a monk or a nun."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like every religion has got some condition, monastic, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, every religion has a system of priests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Coughs severely for a few minutes) Monastic condition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Practice of sacred rites."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, without reference to God, what is the meaning of sacred rites? Everything is reference that accepting the supreme controller. That is the real meaning. At least, Christian religion accepts God, Muhammadan religion accepts God, or Hindu religion accepts God. So without God, how it can be religion? If there is no understanding of God, the conclusion comes that there is no religion. Fictitious. "We trust in God," but do not know what is God. This is going on. So we have to fight against all this nonsense. Nonsense scientists, nonsense religionists. What do you think? It is not easy-going, sleeping business. We have to fight with so many demons. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">kava dava adakanam</span> (?), my Guru Mahārāja used to say. Beg some rice and bring it and cook it and eat and sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Kava daka?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kava dava adakanam.</span> As all our Godbrothers are doing. They have got a little temple, and a few devotees go and beg rice and cook it and eat and sleep, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like being dead almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No fighting spirit. <span class="Italic">Ṭhākura dekhiya (indistinct).</span> Just make a Deity, show. Our Tīrtha Mahārāja is doing that. His whole idea was, that "I have now captured the birthplace of Caitanya Mahāprabhu by high-court favor. Now I have got everything. People will come and they'll pay something, and that will be my income for my family." As the caste <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> do in Navadvīpa and other... A means of livelihood. He has no devotion. He wanted as a means of income. Like the Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs,</span> Navadvīpa <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> do. Little devotion, automatically, there is. They are, after all, worshiping the Deity. But their purpose is different. Just like we have established Rādhā-Vṛndāvanacandra not that people will come and pay something. Who will come here, in this foreign country or in this secluded place? So our aim is to make the devotees real devotees. Not for earning money. When we establish a center in a place like this, where is the idea of getting money? (laughs) Who will come here? One, it is a foreign country, nobody knows what is Kṛṣṇa. And one has to come with so great difficulty, on the mountain. And who is coming to pay for it? After spending so much money, they will come here to pay? Our process is that wherever we stay, we worship Kṛṣṇa. As far as possible. That we are doing. Not for earning money but spending money. Now Tīrtha Mahārāja is seeing that without getting Caitanya Mahāprabhu's birthsite, Swami Mahārāja, he is attracting <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of people. Without the favor of high-court, he is attracting. That is his envy. This year, you were not present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At Māyāpura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you were present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. There was always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That leaflet that he put out that we saw, he put one leaflet advertising that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Apart from that leaflet... Let him do whatever nonsense... But actually, on the birthday of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, there was the greatest crowd in our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, there was a constant... It was just always packed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Every year, before, last year, year before, year before, Caitanya Math, only, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, only their Math people, and some people they invite from Calcutta. But the regular people all come in to our place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes we went to Mādhava Mahārāja's temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Vṛndāvana. Who was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Empty. Completely no one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They didn't even have any of their own men living there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had to unlock the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is on the prominent roadside. And our temple is off. Still, so many people are coming. Neither there were inhabitants nor their outsider, visitors. Gate was closed, we had to open and then enter. And he constructed temple at least for the last twenty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have no vision of expanding, except maybe their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make this money-making machine. They do not know the money will automatically come you are sincere. You haven't got to make it a machine. Money Kṛṣṇa will send. But they have no faith in Kṛṣṇa. They have faith in their own ability. "Yes, we shall earn money in this way, by showing the Deity." They don't recognize Kṛṣṇa's everything. They think "By high-court judgement, if we capture this place, then money will come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Practically speaking, they're finished. They're on their last legs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, other <span class="Italic">svāmīs</span> and yogis they are finding that this Bhaktivedanta Svami alone is preaching all over the... "We, combined, we could not do anything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They are all wondering what your secret is. They always wonder, they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the yogis, <span class="Italic">svāmīs</span> are there. How it is possible? The Ramakrishna Mission, they are working here for the last hundred years. What they have done? If they had actually preached something, so so many American boys and gentlemen are coming to our temple, we cannot give them place. We have to find out some other, and who is going to the Ramakrishna temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They have empty house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If actually Vivekananda preached something, out of inquisitiveness they would have gone there. So "We have heard so much about Ramakrishna and Vivekananda. Let us see what is there." Nobody goes. They do not know even the name. And we are already advertised all over the world, Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement. At least, everyone knows. Who knows Ramakrishna, Vivekananda?</div>

<div class="Purp-para">This is <span class="Italic">Brahma-stotra</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, Fourteenth <span class="Italic">Adhyāya.</span> From <span class="Italic">brahmovaca, brahma-stuti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just stick to this principle, then you will be successful. <span class="Italic">Bhakti śreyaḥ śrutim.</span> That is the real welfare. <span class="Italic">Śreyaḥ śrutim</span> means "expands auspicity." (apparently talking about a picture) And they want to become one with God. And here is not one, but God is so lower that He carries the shoe of His devotee. Have they got any conception like this? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are always talking about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a verse <span class="Italic">śruti mahāpure śruti mahāpure.</span> You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti apare?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti mahāpure. (indistinct) yasya linde paraṁ brahma.</span> "Let others worship the <span class="Italic">śrutis</span> and others <span class="Italic">smṛtis,</span> all these Vedic literature, and others <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> for liberation. But I shall worship Nanda Mahārāja, because in his courtyard the Param Brahmā is loitering. I shall worship Nanda Mahārāja. He's so powerful that he's made the Param Brahman come here and carry his shoes." <span class="Italic">Śruti mahāpure (indistinct) yasya linde paraṁ brahma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was by a Muslim who became Vaiṣṇava? Once you quoted that, I think that verse, in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another similar verse. Yes, you quoted me. And there is another verse by Bilvamaṅgala, in <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.</span> The Muslim, he said "I was searching after the Param Brahma, and now I see here He is playing with the <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span>" What they will speculate? Everything is there in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Where this picture is given? (Prabhupāda is being massaged)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Which book is it in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was on the cover of one <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But it's in one of the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Lord Caitanya did the same thing. He did the same thing, and it was compared Kṛṣṇa also had done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no such acceptance, where is religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It just becomes a show. Religion nowadays has degenerated so that people more or less accept it just as some moral code now, because there's no knowledge of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is that morality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (laughs) There's no morality either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> While hunting, drinking, meat-eating, is that morality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No. (end)</div>
