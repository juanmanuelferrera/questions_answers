<div class="Heading">Interview<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>March 5, 1975, New York</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the question? Any question? Or shall we speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swamiji, can you please? Yes, please. Can you tell us what your purpose is in coming to New York at this time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To New York, I am coming here since 1965. I have got my temple. So I am going to London. So it is for the time being, transit stoppage. Otherwise I have got my temple here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> What special message would you have for people who don't know anything about your movement and would like to know something about it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About the movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes, what special message for the people who don't know about us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a little difficult to understand this movement, because it is spiritual movement. People practically have no information what is spirit and what is spiritual movement, but they can simply understand that the body is there. Body is the machine. And the driver of the machine is the spirit soul. So we are beginning our movement from that platform, the driver of the machine. People are very much engrossed with the machine only, but they have no information who is driving the machine. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swamiji, your movement has received a great deal of attention for, at least one reason, because many of your followers dress in what for the West is an odd fashion and relate to the world in what for the West is an odd fashion. Can you respond to that? Why have you asked your followers to dress in this fashion and to play drums on the streets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our preaching method, some way or other to draw their attention. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya! Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I'm sure that you're aware that to many people in the West, in America, in New York City specifically, that your disciples seem strange because of the way they act on the streets. What about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must be strange because they are spiritual. You are all material. (laughter) So, for the material persons, we are surely strange people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Is this manifestation the only way to be spiritual, dressing in this fashion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you cannot compete with us. Because we don't have any illicit sex, we don't have meat-eating, we have no intoxication, we have no gambling. There's so many no's which you are unable to perform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swami, that wasn't my question. My question was, is this manifestation, dressing in this fashion, playing drums and dancing in the streets, the only way to be spiritual?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got about sixty books. If you want to learn this movement through science and philosophy, we have got our books. You have not seen our books? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swami, that isn't the thrust of my question. Yes, I have. The thrust of my question very simply is this: Can't people be spiritual without dressing in this fashion and dancing in the street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, oh, yes, you can become spiritual in your this dress. Simply you have to learn what it is from the books. The dress... dress is not very important thing, but still, in the material field, this girl is dressed in a different way, you are dressed in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> The way we dress lets us move in all circles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> No, the thing is, dress is not very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But you have your disciples dress in this way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But just to draw a particular... Just like the policeman, he is differently dressed. One can understand that he is policeman. Similarly, we are also differently dressed so that people may understand we are Hare Kṛṣṇa people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya! Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> Swami, I saw a television program about your movement once, and they said that the men make the decisions and the women follow. Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> She hears that the men make the decisions and that the women follow these decisions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. We follow the decision of Kṛṣṇa, men and women both. We follow the decision of Kṛṣṇa. That is applicable both men and women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Are men superior in your movement, though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Are men regarded as superior to women?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, naturally. Naturally, woman requires protection by the man. In the childhood she is protected by the father, and youth time she is protected by the husband, and old age she is protected by elderly sons. That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> That goes against the thinking of a lot of people in America now. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... America, maybe, but this is the natural position. Women require protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> Who decides who's natural? And what's natural?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Natural means just like in psychology it is said that woman, the highest brain substance of woman is thirty-six ounce, whereas the highest brain substance of man is sixty-four ounce. So there is difference by nature, of the brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> Well (laughter), to get to something else, what do you do for fun when you're in New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that? I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You have defeated her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> (laughs) But I'm not going to pursue your line of logic. And what do you do for fun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is natural defeat. You cannot avoid it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> I can't what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You cannot avoid it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> Again, what do you do to have a good time in New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A sixteen-years-old boy can travel all over the world, and it is very difficult for a sixteen-years-old girl to travel all over the world. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Thank you, Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Have you realized the highest truth yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> At what age did you realize God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can deliver to you also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can deliver to you also if you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> My question to you is at what age did you realize God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is a person like you and me. The difference is that we are also persons. We are many, and God is one, leader. Now, what is the difference between this one and we many? He maintains all these many, and we are maintained by Him, but He is also a person like you and me. Do you follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, I do, but Swamiji, my question to you was a bit more pointed than that. I appreciate the answer you just gave me, but at what age did you realize the highest truth? At what physical age...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of age. Realization of God should be educated from the very beginning of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Oh, I understand that, Swamiji. My question to you was at what age did you yourself in this physical incarnation realize the highest truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of course, we were born in a very nice family. My father educated me in this way. So practically from the very beginning of our life we were educated in this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Oh, no, I understand that. I mean at what time did you have your own personal realization, Swamiji? At what age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that I can say from the age, say, four or five years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> At the age of four or five years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Female Reporter:</span> Swami, is there a chance that all your followers can realize the highest truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have already done. They have already done. Otherwise, I am Indian, I am poor man. Why they are after me? You Americans, you are rich men. So I have not bribed them. These young boys, they are educated, qualified. Why they are after me unless they have realized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swamiji, I have one other question for you, please. By definition, it seems to me anyway, and I think to other observers, and sympathetic observers at that, that you have asked your spiritual children to leave the outer world in the West and to go deep within the heart of ISKCON, within your heart and the heart of the Supreme, to accomplish what you've set as their goal. What about outer service to humanity in this incarnation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the best humanity's service. They were all fools and rascals and we educated them for spiritual understanding. The material... If I think "I am this body," then I am no better than cat and dog. That is going on. "I am American." "I am Indian." "I am Hindu." "I am Muslim." "I am Christian." Only this bodily relationship. But suppose you have come to me, can I ask you whether you are body or something else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Swamiji, perhaps the deficiency is in my question. Let me rephrase the question, if you'll permit. And I realize there isn't much air to breathe. Hare Kṛṣṇa. But I will make the question brief. My question has to do with <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> in the outer world, for instance, in New York City. From what I understand, your disciples do not pursue the professions. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are also, we are also <span class="Italic">karma-yogī.</span> We are also eating, we are also sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Oh, no, I understand that. I'm speaking in terms of outer service to people who are not in your mission. Other than preaching the truth of Kṛṣṇa, is there any other outer service to humanity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will include everything. If we make Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he becomes perfectly educated. We do not require to... Just like if you pour water on the root of the tree, the water reaches everywhere. And if you pour water on the leaf, on the twig, or on the branch, it does not go anywhere. It is localized. So at the present moment, service is a particular departmental service, not all-including. So, to educate people in Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to educate him all round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> I understand, Swamiji. Again the deficiency is obviously with my question. My question relates to service to the outer world by your disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That if you pour water on the root of the tree, the service reaches everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> How is that manifesting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manifested? That's like if you eat and give the foodstuff to your stomach, then you realize that you have got energy in every part of your body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, I've understood your words, and I'm grateful for them, but again the problem, obviously, is with me and not with you. But the question still remains, what about being of material service. Material service, not just spiritual service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is material service, as I showed. If you put foodstuff in your stomach, all the parts of your body feel energetic. That is material service. That is not spiritual service. Spiritual service (is) beyond that. Similarly, the center is God. If you understand God, then you understand everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Understood, Swamiji. But your disciples do not build houses, they don't work in hospitals, they don't perform-as far as I know, and I could just be swimming in ignorance here-as far as I know, they do not perform service to the outer world other than offering free meals at the temple and preaching the word of Lord Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I, I quite follow. That is your ignorance. Because you do not know that what is the real service. You do not know. Do you know what is real service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> The answer should come from you and not from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The real service is... Suppose you open hospital. You can cure for the time being some disease, but can you give me, can you give him any assurance that he will not die? Can you protect him from death? In spite of your all big, big hospitals, can you protect humanity from death, from birth, from old age, from disease? Can you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Physically, of course not, only spiritually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That we are giving. That we are giving you, that no more death, no more birth, no more old age, and no more disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But couldn't your disciples perform all the wonderful things that you have them do and at the same time provide outer material service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are doing. They are doing. What they are not doing? They are doing all service. We have got this body. We have to maintain this body. We are doing everything. We are also eating, we are also sleeping, as you are eating, we are sleeping. Where is the difference? We also allow sex, but not illicit sex. We allow eating, but no meat-eating. That is the difference. We are also eating, as you are eating. We are sleeping, as you are sleeping. Where is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Perhaps only in some perceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Perhaps only in some perceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Thank you, Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (end)</div>
