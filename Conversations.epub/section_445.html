<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...too simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore they do not take it. Just like homeopathic medicine. You know homeopathic medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, homeopathic medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, simply water. So they do not like to take it. Actually, they do not want God. They want <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Otherwise, if anyone wants God, Kṛṣṇa, there is no difficulty. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, mām evaiśyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Four things. "Just always think of Me," <span class="Italic">man-manā. Mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> "Just become My devotee." <span class="Italic">Mad-yājī:</span> "You worship Me. And offer your obeisances unto Me. If you do simply these four things, then you are coming back to Me without any doubt." These four things. But they cannot do it or will not do it. Otherwise, very simple. We are thinking of something always. Simply we have to replace Kṛṣṇa. No. They'll think so many other things except Kṛṣṇa. This is the difficulty. Otherwise, it is not at all difficult. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They'll make a program: "Thoughtlessness." That lady was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> To become thoughtless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they are disgusted with this material thought, therefore they want to make it zero. But that is not possible. You must think of something. But they have no spiritual idea. They do not know what is spiritual thinking. They think that "Make it zero. These thoughts, let us make it zero." Just like a diseased man, suffering for, from the very beginning of his life... Then, if somebody suggests that "When you'll be cured, you'll very nicely eat, nicely walk and nicely think," so he's coming to the stage of diseased condition, "Again thinking? Again eating? Again lying down on bed? Then what is the difference? No, no. It must be zero: no eating, no sleeping, no bedding, nothing." He's thinking like that. Because he has got bad experience of his diseased condition, he thinks, "Again if there is eating, again if there is walking, then how it can be cured?" He cannot think of. These rascals, because they have no idea what is spiritual thinking, they want to make this thinking zero only. That's all. <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādī.</span> They are called <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādī, nirvāṇa,</span> Buddhist philosophy. "Your body is subjected to pains and pleasure; so dismantle this body." This is Buddha philosophy. "Make it zero. There will be no more pains and pleasure." "You have got some trouble in the eyes? Pluck it out." He does not know how to cure it. He simply knows, "Pluck it out." This is their philosophy. <span class="Italic">Asatyere satya kari māni.</span> Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's song.</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">ahaṅkāre matta hoiyā, nitāi-pada pāsariyā,<br class="calibre2"/>asatyere satya kari māni</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Being puffed up by false ego, I am, I have taken untruth as truth. And when somebody speaks about truth, I take it as untruth." <span class="Italic">Asatyere satya kare māni.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (aside:) You should cover it. Why cover?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There's a path that leads to the lake here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's not enough room for everyone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There's a small path, but it's not very big. We can continue around this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> [break] ... complicated solution to the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. These rascals, they do not know that our process is most difficult. Because as soon as ask them that "Give up meat-eating," it is very difficult task for them. And actually, it is very difficult for them. You see? That gentleman in Geneva, as long as I was talking about meat-eating, he became little disgusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said, "Why don't we speak of higher principles?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah. Because this is the beginning of higher principles. "No, no, this may let... Let it remain. Let us go to the higher principles." The rascal does not know that you cannot go without learning A,B,C,D, how you can ask for passing M.A. examination? But "No, I do not know A,B,C,D, but let me go for passing M.A. examination." You see. This is A,B,C,D, that <span class="Italic">yeṣām anta gatam...</span> Any sinful man, he cannot understand about God. It is not possible. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.</span> But without being <span class="Italic">pavitra,</span> they want to go to the platform of understanding God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just like that Gene Herbert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Just like that Sanskritist in Geneva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "I, I am smoking. I do not like to give it up." (laughter) You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I think from here we have to walk on the sidewalk. There may be cars coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Let Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very, very difficult for them. To give up intoxication, especially in the western countries. That Lord Zetland, Marquis of Zetland, when one of my godbrothers went to London for preaching, so Lord Zetland said, "Can you make me a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?"</span> And then he said, "Yes, why not? You have to give up these things: no illicit sex, no intoxication." He said, "Oh, it is impossible. For us, it is impossible." So actually, these four prohibitory rules is impossible for these rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They would rather die than give them up, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the... Even our men, after so much training, they're also falling down. It is so difficult thing. Actually, it is the most difficult thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Is the path down at the lake very big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Would you like to walk down by the lake or is this...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is all right. In India, also, although they are vegetarian, they cannot give up smoking even beedie. They cannot give up chewing pan. You see? This is very difficult task. I was thinking when I first came that as soon as I propose these things, because I have got experience that Lord Zetland said, "It is impossible," what they, they'll accept? And I'll have to go back again. But I did not make any compromise. Just like other rascal yogis and swamis, they say, "Yes, yes. You can eat whatever you like. You can do whatever... You practice nose pressing. That's all. And give me my fees. Then you'll (indistinct)." This is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> When you had your talk several years ago with the professor in Russia, he made the point, when you were discussing about the regulative principles, that if you follow these principles, then your life becomes very simple, and if you don't follow these principles, life becomes very complicated. He appreciated that one point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Any sane man will appreciate. Our... <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> Without <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti... Anartha-nivṛtti</span> means stopping all unwanted things. <span class="Italic">Anartha. Anartha</span> means which does not give us any profit and unnecessarily we are accustomed. Suppose we do not take any intoxicant. So what is our inconvenience? But people are spending millions and millions of dollars only for smoking. Therefore it is useless, <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> But they cannot give it up. And condition is that without <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti,</span> there cannot be attachment for God.</div>
<div class="Verse">ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā<br class="calibre2"/>tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>athāsaktis tato bhāvas tataḥ premābhyudañcati<br class="calibre2"/>sādhakānām ayaṁ premṇaḥ prādurbhāve bhavet kramaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> These are the steps. So after <span class="Italic">anartha-nivṛtti,</span> one is firmly fixed up in devotional service. And if the <span class="Italic">anarthas</span> are disturbing him, then he's not fixed up. He'll fall down. He'll fall down. That risk is already there. So these people are so much accustomed to this <span class="Italic">anartha,</span> and they cannot give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What is the best way to gradually get them detached?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The best way to gradually get them detached?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhajana-kriyā.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">bhajana-kriyā, sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">,</span> association with devotees and stick to the devotional program. Just like devotional program we have got. <span class="Italic">Bhajana-kriyā.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">bhajana-kriyā.</span> One cannot be slack in the process of devotional service. Then it will be... <span class="Italic">Vidhi-mārga,</span> the regulative principles: chant sixteen rounds, rise early in the morning, have <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārātrika,</span> read books, take your bath-these are the process. <span class="Italic">Bhajana-kriyā. Bhajana</span> means devotional service, and <span class="Italic">kriyā...</span> The yogis, they call <span class="Italic">kriyā-yoga.</span> So this lake is dirty water, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drain water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Generally, all these rivers, everywhere now, are all contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means the mode of civilization is so nice that everything is becoming contaminated. And why not the people? They're also contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That is called madness when they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Madness when they keep creating things which are hurting them, but they don't stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> is very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We can go down this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break] ...different countries, they are very careful. When foreigners come, if they bring some fruit, "No, no. You cannot take it within." And they keep the lakes contaminated. You cannot bring in one fruit, but you can keep the whole lake contaminated. This is their intelligence. Why they are contaminating? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All the factories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their very business is contaminated, factories. [break] Even the sea has become contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The sea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Long Island and those places, if you go, the sea, the sea is so dirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> In New York, they're anticipating a crisis because for many years, they've been taking all their trash and rubbish and putting it out in the sea. And now that whole part of the sea is coming in towards land, very, very contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. The article said that they dump their garbage in a certain area, and nothing can grow there except the most poisonous bacteria. And now that whole business is moving back towards the population.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reaction. Everything... <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe karmaṇo yatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> Whatever you do, you are bound up by the reaction. That is nature's law. [break] ...and occasionally there will be big war, and they'll kill themselves. That's all. Now they are killing animals. That is a separate from human being. But time will come, the human beings, they will kill themselves, one another. Not only one, two, but wholesale. Daily, millions or thousands will be killed. They want to avoid war. For that reason, they invented the United Nations. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they want to avoid war? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> For avoiding war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They want to maintain their pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Why encroach upon others' pleasure? <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā mā gṛdhaḥ kasya svid dhanam [Īśo mantra 1]. Īśopaniṣad</span> says, "Don't encroach upon others' pleasure."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Because they have no spiritual idea or spiritual pleasure, they can never be satisfied. So they're always envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no coconut tree, mango tree, banana tree. Huh? These are all useless tree, simply for becoming fuel. That's all. They're also condemned. Yes. Sinful trees. There are pious trees and sinful trees. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (pause) We have to go straight? (pause) This park is bigger than that Golden Gate Park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says that "One who is always active within is very dear to Me." Does this mean we should struggle to keep our minds engaged all the time in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Active within? Active within?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> "Active within."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that, "active within"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> It is in the Third Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Active within." What is that "active within"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Thinking of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good. <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā.</span> Yes. We should be always active in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, within or without. That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Antar bahiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">apavitraḥ pavitro vā<br class="calibre2"/>sarvāvasthāṁ gato 'pi vā<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ smaret puṇḍarīkākṣaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa bāhya abhyantaram (śuci)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Bāhya means external, and <span class="Italic">abhyantaram</span> means internal. So we should be active, both, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, externally and internally. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,</span> externally hearing and chanting, and <span class="Italic">smaraṇam,</span> internally <span class="Italic">smaraṇam,</span> thinking-these are the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break] If somebody asks, "Give me one picture," and I ask my secretary-"There is no picture." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yogeśvara is going to give me a whole collection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So we can walk to the car through here. Will there come a time when people will become disgusted with the scientists and reject them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They'll more and more forget Kṛṣṇa. This is Kali-yuga. On account of these blind leaders. Don't you see that this rascal Darwin's theory, that is very much appreciated? Any movement which tries to get out God, very much appreciated, that is very much appreciated. That is scientific. "You forget God," that is scientific. And as soon as you speak of God, "You are primitive, old type." That's all. "You are conservative." That, another rascal, Allen Ginsberg, he was speaking, "Swamiji, you are very conservative." Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...discuss that the fact that when people die in different modes of nature, how they come back, and you say that (if) people die in the mode of passion, they come back in human life, if they die in the mode of ignorance, they come back in demonic species of life. So the people today seem to be... Is it that they'll all come back as animals in their next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> How does a person come back in... What merits a person coming back in human life? It seems like an elevated birth. How does mode of passion give one the opportunity of human life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally, people are mixed, <span class="Italic">rajas-tamas.</span> So human life, also, they're animals like. They cannot understand anything. Just like when we speak of "Don't eat meat," they become angry. So what is this human life? It is simply in the form of human life. They give example that "There are many animals; they eat flesh. Therefore why we shall not eat?" The other day, the man... I, "You are not animal." Then he was stopped. He thinks that he's human being, but he wants to eat like animal. So what kind of human being he is? Just see. He is proud to become human being, but he wants to behave like animal. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has taken all these people as <span class="Italic">paśu. Sei paśu baḍo durācāra.</span> He has not said that he's human being.</div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">nitāi nā bolilo mukhe, majilo saṁsāra-sukhe,<br class="calibre2"/>vidyā-kule ki koribe tāra</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Vidyā-kule ki koribe tāra. Sei paśu baḍo durācāra. Śva-viḍ-varāha uṣṭra.
