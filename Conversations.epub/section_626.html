<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...hoping to bring the buses here to take a photograph with you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> ...Mr. Candra Ahuja Tir(?). He has loaned us the Continental which we have been using to drive you in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You are medical practitioner? [break] Cooler, cooler nowadays? [break] Then other big, big telescope, how many miles it can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You can see millions of miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many million? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You can see light years away. Many, many, many millions of miles with the big ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can see four billion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Maybe not four billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is imperfect. The radius, what is called, radius?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Diameter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Diameter is four billion miles, universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> One universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One universe. This is the smallest. Four-headed Brahma. [break] ...all universes taken together, that is one-fourth energy. And three-fourth energy is spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Ekāṁśena sthito jagat [Bg. 10.42],</span> one part. [break] <span class="Italic">...asat koṭi-yojana</span>, one <span class="Italic">yojana</span> equal to eight mile. And one <span class="Italic">koti</span> means ten million. So fifty into eight, two hundred, into..., ten into ten million..., it comes. I have calculated four billion. How many millions make a billion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A thousand. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is situated in the middle from this circumference, two billion up and down. And the moon is situated above the sun, 1,600,000 miles. How they can go to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They think the moon is closer than the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may think, but we are thinking in this way. Who is right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We are right, the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...thinking is right because they could not go to the moon. They say they went, but actually they could not. Now they are disappointed. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...Prabhupāda? He had some question whether Lord Nityānanda ever took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. [break] ...went with the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> as <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> [break] ...philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Philosophy book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Philosophy book is waiting until...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, Hayagrīva is editing it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, now? <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We're going to do some of the chapters in installments in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> We're going to do Darwin as soon as possible, in a month or two. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...philosophy is the ultimate, Vedānta. Vedānta philosophy. And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> is the commentary on the Vedānta philosophy. [break] ...Darwin's theory. Wherefrom he begins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He begins in the ocean. He says that some fish-type animal climbed out of the ocean and began to breathe the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then wherefrom the ocean came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He doesn't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> In the beginning on the planet there was great turbulence and the oceans were stirring, and then there was some lightning charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom the lightning came? And wherefrom the ocean came? Where his philosophy is? It is a speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> It all began from a primeval explosion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then same question, wherefrom the explosion came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say that explosion began at time zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Time zero. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Time zero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Time began then, at time zero. And they say that if you ask the question, "What was before that?" that's not a logical, sensible question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say it's a question that should not even be asked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then you are rascal. You are beginning from zero. How you can begin from zero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Everything comes from nothing then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrī Govinda:</span> They say it all originates from a giant mass of primordial matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then same comes..., that "Wherefrom the matter comes?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They say it's an accident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another nonsense, another rascaldom. Where is the accident? Nothing is accident, everything is cause and effect. We say that in the beginning there was God or word of God. In <span class="Italic">Bible</span> they say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God was there and God's word was there. That is the beginning, our beginning. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1]. Aham evāsam agre.</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is our philosophy, "Everything begins from God." Now you can say, "Wherefrom God came?" But that is God. God existing, He is not caused by any other cause, He is the original cause. <span class="Italic">Anādir ādiḥ:</span> "He has no beginning, but He is the beginning of everything." This is conception of God. <span class="Italic">Anādir ādir govindaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That <span class="Italic">ādi</span> is Govinda, person, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> We find from the history. Brahmā is the beginning. He is <span class="Italic">deva,</span> one of the demigods. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām.</span> So He is the cause of Brahmā also. So this is our philosophy. We don't begin from zero or accident. This is not our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Darwin never tried to understand the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he admitted that he speculated. He is not a philosopher, he is a speculator. He has admitted that "It is my speculation. I think like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He started his speculation from the creation of life. He didn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere, speculation is not science nor philosophy. We don't admit. No hypothesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They call the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> speculation. They say the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> are speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, not speculation. <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad, īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1],</span> everything beginning from <span class="Italic">īśa,</span> the supreme controller... Where is speculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are written by man so they are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are less than a dog. It is written by man. That's all right. But you are less than a dog. You have no reason, no right. What is your philosophy? What is the value of your philosophy? It is speculation. We don't say, "It is written by man." <span class="Italic">Apauruṣeya.</span> They may say whatever they..., we don't say. If somebody says, "Your father name is that," and I know my father's name. "What you are? You are not authority to say what is my father's name. I know very well." So it is their suggestion like that, "Your father's name is this." We don't say that "My father name is..." Is that very good suggestion? You don't know anything of my family. How you say that "Your father name is this?" Is it not another rascaldom? You do not know anything about my family, and you say that "Your father's name is this." What is this logic? You cannot say what is my father's name. You do not know about my family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Darwin's whole theory rests on the fact, the speculation, that he can show bones. They take these bones and these evidences, archeological...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, it is not possible that he has seen all the bones. That is not possible. So taking it that he has studied by seeing the bones, but I can say very easily that it is not possible for a person like you to see all the bones. That is my challenge. How you can say that you have seen all the bones? You say, "Millions and millions of years ago..." You live for fifty years. How you have seen all the bones? That is imperfect. You are a limited person. How it is possible that you have seen all the bones? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say they haven't found all the bones, but what they've found is conclusive evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then you cannot do that. If you have seen all the bones, then you can conclude. You say, "Some of the missing." So how it is fact? You did not see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Just this year they found a skull that was millions of years older than any human skull they found before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But still, you cannot say that you have seen all the skulls. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They will say they have not even found one skull from the Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. No, Vedic culture do not keep skull, they burn it. Therefore there is no opportunity for you to see the Vedic culture. Then you become defective. Because you cannot see the skulls of Vedic culture. We burn it. So therefore your conclusion is defective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the only bones they find are the bones of the fifth, sixth, seventh-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, of the monkey-class men. (laughter) That's all. Therefore you conclude that the man comes from monkey. That is the conclu... Human being, Vedic culture, they burn it. So they have no opportunity to see the human being skull. The monkeys, they do not burn. So he has seen only the monkey skull, and his conclusion is, "Man is from monkey."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually they are simply interested in bones, but this is the activity of the dog. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, he finds, (laughter) like that. So it is dog's philosophy. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...history in the I.A., intermediate. So a big professor, Dr. Kalidasa Nath, he began to speak, "There was stone age, simply stone there was," in this way. And I immediately..., that "What nonsense you are speaking, stone? There was nothing?" According to the anthropology of Darwin... From the very beginning, when I was a student, I did not believe this Darwin's theory. [break] ...study one after another, chronologically, as Darwin says, skull, it is not possible at all. For any single man it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 8,400,000 species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Has he gone down the water? Then what is the...? simply speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Factual scientific study would mean to study all 8,400,000 species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is scientific study. But that is not possible. Therefore your theory is always imperfect because you cannot say that "I have studied all." You simply guess, "There is some gap, millions of years." So this is not study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say even there's a missing link, a part that they cannot explain. So they admit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's the most important part too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say they are rascals. And rascals will believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Once you said the missing link was your foot in their face. (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...logic also it is admitted that inductive logic is imperfect; deductive logic is perfect. [break] ...logic means <span class="Italic">śrota-panthā, paramparā, śruti,</span> Vedic language, <span class="Italic">śruti. Śruti pramāṇa. Pramāṇa</span> means evidence, and <span class="Italic">śruti</span> means <span class="Italic">Veda. Pratyakṣa, anumāna, śruti. Pratyakṣa</span> means direct, direct evidence, and <span class="Italic">anumāna,</span> hypothesis. That is Darwin's theory, something like that. And <span class="Italic">śruti,</span> Vedic. So out of these three kinds of evidences, <span class="Italic">śruti-pramāṇa</span> is accepted as supreme, neither <span class="Italic">anumāna</span> nor <span class="Italic">pratyakṣa. Pratyakṣa,</span> you are seeing the sky, but you cannot say the length and breadth. You cannot say. You are seeing daily. If you say, "I have got this telescope," so that is an imperfect. and how you can see with your eyes directly, direct sense perception? Hypothesis, <span class="Italic">anumāna,</span> guessing, that is also not perfect. And <span class="Italic">śruti,</span> we take <span class="Italic">śruti</span> from the perfect person, Kṛṣṇa. He says, <span class="Italic">aham evāsam agre:</span> "Before the creation I was there." We take simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa says that in the beginning of creation He sent forth generations of men among the demigods. So the bones that they have found of those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> I said the bones that they have found so far...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> Of the men that were living so many thousands of years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are not demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> No. But who are the bones... Where are those living entities now? Where they have gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can go to the higher planetary system and try to see there, bones of the demigods. Besides that, according to our <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> when Brahmā dies, then everything is finished. So you have no chance to see. Where is your chance? Because everything will be finished, you will be finished, everything finished, with the death of Brahma, so you cannot study Brahma's bones. Just like taste of potassium cyanide. As soon as you taste, you are finished. (laughter) So you cannot say what is the taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> But the bones of those people that they've found, where are their bodies now? Have they gone to some other...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you might have found in your country. But that is not final that you have seen all the bones. [break] Darwin has... He is now dead. Now, even nowadays they are finding new bones. So how he studies perfect? He is now dead and gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually they are finding bones now, they claim, that challenge his theory. They are much older than what he ever thought. So they have to change all the calculations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> Even their method for dating the bones is defective also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> They have a scientific, not scientific, but they have a process how they date the bones. It's called the carbon 14 dating process, and it's been proved defective. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...so many bones, they should draw the conclusion that the big problem is death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) That is impossible, sir. You lick up your bones, but you have to die. You have to lay down your bone now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If the Vedic culture was a superior culture, how come man gave up the Vedic culture to take to the materialistic life? one</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one has given up. You are taking up. No one has given up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But five thousands years ago...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Otherwise how you are getting if it was given up? How you are getting now? It was not given up. Who says it was given up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, America was formed on a materialistic society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America may say, but if it was given up, then how you are getting now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Now Americans are taking it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How it is given up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> They will say that it became dormant. Not that many people liked it anymore so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dormant. It is coming. It is coming. We have not lost it. It may be that a few people know it, but it is not lost. It is not that missing bone; it is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say like in Chicago they're so prosperous, but they don't worship Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Here in Chicago, there's so many big buildings and there's so much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So building, what you will do with building? You have to leave the building and go to hell. What you are doing for that? So long, fifty years, you can lick up the building. Then, after all, you will be thrown into the hell. Then what you are going to do about that? If you cannot stay in the building, then what is the use of constructing building? Suppose you construct one building here and the policeman..., "No, you cannot stay here." Still you construct building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say they live for sixty years, so enjoy it while they can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is foolishness. You are making, (imitates piledrivers sound) "Dung! Dung!" very solid, but you are not going to live. The "Dung! Dung!" but that's all. This is called foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think there was one great personality-I forget his name-he was going to live as long as how many millions of years that he had hairs in his head. What is that story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The story of the man who was on the beach...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. Romaharṣaṇa. Romaharṣaṇa Muni was standing on beach and was chanting. So Nārada Muni was passing: "Then why don't you make a cottage here?" He was: "Oh, how long I shall...?" That, his life, was: when one hair will fall, one Brahmā will die. (laughter) And in this way all the hairs, when they will fall-all the Brahmās will die-then he will die. And he was thinking, "How...?" Actually that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who was that, Romaharṣaṇa Muni?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Romaharṣaṇa. [break] ...basic principle of Vedic civlization. They did not... Vyāsadeva, such a learned scholar, he was sitting in a cottage. Lord Śiva, such a big powerful, and the whole material energy, Parvati, is his wife-he is sitting under a tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is always moving around, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vairāgya.</span> That is required. That is civilization. <span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna. Jñāna-vairāgya,</span> knowledge and renunciation, or detachment, this is the goal of human life. Because he is attached to this material world, he has to take birth after birth, birth after birth. So to save this botheration, one has to be detached. This is the basic principle of Vedic civilization, <span class="Italic">jñāna-vairāgya.</span> And detachment is possible when one is in full knowledge, <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> And this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process is detachment. <span class="Italic">Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> So it is a civilization of detachment, not attachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That detachment is a form of wealth for the renounced order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the gain of human life. <span class="Italic">Arthadam.</span> This is meaning. <span class="Italic">Artha</span> means meaning. <span class="Italic">Arthadam. Durlābhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma tad apy adhruvam arthadam.</span> This human life, form of life, is very, very rare. So one can say, "You will also die like cats and dog. How it is rare?" No, yes, <span class="Italic">adhruvam arthadam:</span> "Although it is temporary, it will not stay, but you can have meaning of life." <span class="Italic">Adhruvam arthadam.</span> Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The materialistic people say that... When they see someone in the detached position, they say, "He is impoverished." They are so confused that they conclude the opposite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impoverished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Impoverished means they are poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the poor? What you are rich? You are whole day working day and night, and we are not working, getting our <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> I am poverty-stricken, or you are poverty-stricken? You rascal, whole day you are working...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> For a dry biscuit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...like an ass, and we are getting, sitting, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and getting our food. So you are poverty-stricken or I am poverty-stricken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A poverty-stricken man has to work very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lakṣmī-nārāyaṇa:</span> But they will say, "Well..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will say... First of all you see. You try to understand that this rascal is working day and night twenty-four hours for getting his food, and we are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and getting our food. So he is poverty-stricken or I am poverty-stricken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That means we're the rich men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Rich man doesn't have to work, and everything comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is rich man. That is the explanation given by Marshall, a great economist. He says that unless one is obliged to work, nobody will work. That is his economic impetus. So the family affection gives impetus to work. He has to maintain the family. That is, he says, that is the beginning of economic development. Marshall theory. [break] <span class="Italic">...kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate.</span> When there is attachment on account of Kṛṣṇa, that is detachment. <span class="Italic">Yukta-vairāgyam ucyate.</span> He is attached to everything but not for his personal self. We are spending <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees for constructing a temple, but we are not interested to construct a house or a skyscraper building. We are not interested. That is detachment. [break] We give up. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhe-vastunaḥ:</span> "No, no, we don't touch money." Why? If the money can be utilized for constructing a nice temple for Kṛṣṇa, why we shall say, "We don't touch money"? Yes, give me as much money as you have got. Therefore you will find in India very, very big, big, costly temple, not skyscraper building. That is the sign. If any man had any money, he would spend it for Kṛṣṇa, not for his personal self. Personally he would be satisfied with a cottage. That is India's civilization. You will find in South India one temple is more than a fort, bigger. It is impossible to construct such temple nowadays. Still you will find in Vṛndāvana that broken Govindaji's temple. If you construct such temple, even crores and crores of rupees will not be sufficient. That was done by Mahārāja Mansingha, but you don't find any palace of Mansingha. He could have construct a palace there. No, he did not do. But for Govindaji, he spent so much money. There is no such thing, attachment, detachment. We must know that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, and we are servants of Kṛṣṇa. This knowledge is required. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And when you understand that everything is belonging to Kṛṣṇa, then the next sense is that why not everything be used for Kṛṣṇa? [break] ...theory is lost or not?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I'm going to send this tape and have them add that to the book. You defeated Darwin so quickly this morning it was wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can send. You have no chance to study. How you can theorize? (end)</div>
