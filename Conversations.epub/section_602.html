<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have given up the <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-sadācāra</span> for business selling. So you can be dangerous for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But we have also maintained the <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-sadācāra.</span> They didn't tell us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You do that. But they do not see whether you are maintaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But at the same time, when we were maintaining that, we had the same problems, is that, when we presented sociological applications of the philosophy, for instance, to arrange marriages in a reasonable way, that the women not be sent out on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> to prostitute themselves to sell books, but be trained up to be wives, or that the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> in the temple, someone would sit and talk with them and see how many of them want to be married and try and arrange some type of training for them, knowing that most of them are going to become married, rather than just have no training and one day find oneself married, out on the street with no occupation or training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you are not trained up. You are sometimes becoming astrologer, sometimes this, sometimes that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's true, because of my birth in this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how they can follow you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We're not asking them to follow us. We're asking you Prabhupāda, that these are some problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My request is that first of all you adopt yourself the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāra.</span> Then you try to teach others. Otherwise you have no right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But we have done that for five years, and no one here listened to us at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are anxious to listen... You... Let them not listen. You do your own duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We had no duty. They gave us nothing to do. They would not recognize our qualities, as we understand, even of, say Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, you can make statements on certain of these things so that when they hear them, their ignorance will be dispelled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we have to hear both of you. We have to hear both you... There will be regular court, and we shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Not court, simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That would be fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Before me. You are saying something. They may say something else. So brothers together, we sit down together, and bring this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> All right. But we have some, also, questions that don't require that. These are philosophical questions. For instance, in <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> Book there is a statement that King Ugrasena had four billion personal servants. Now you have asked that we go and spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness to the scientific community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone is servant. What is the question of four billion? Kṛṣṇa's servant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, Ugrasena, King Ugrasena, that when he was on the planet, he had four billion personal servants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. He is always the master. He... The Kṛṣṇa is the only master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Not Kṛṣṇa. No. King Ugrasena, Prabhupāda. Not Kṛṣṇa. King Ugrasena. The statement is that King Ugrasena had four billion personal servants. Now, we have gone and tried to spread to the scientific community. And if we say to them, "There was a king whose name was Ugrasena. He had four billion personal servants," they laugh and say, "What did they do for toilets? What did they do for food? Where did they live?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you want to preach this particular portion and no other portion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No. We want to... We want to know if the story has an allegorical meaning rather than a literal translation, or that King Ugrasena who was a man who lived five thousand years ago and had four billion bodyguards, or whether the stories within the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> apart from some of them being actual, are allegorical stories. Such as the story of Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma chopping off the the eighty-eight...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. You can give up that portion. You can take other portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We don't mean to give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We don't mean to give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We're saying how can we say to them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone, anyone... Why you are going to preach that portion to a professor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No. When they read your books, they pose that question to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They read it. They say to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> And unless we can answer that question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They ask to only you, but they never ask to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They have. Sometimes they ask me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Let them ask. But you can tell away that(?) but you don't repeat this thing. You can give up that portion. You read other portion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But then because so many things they have to accept on faith without knowing, it then weakens their faith as to what they should accept and why should they accept Kṛṣṇa, who they can't see any more than King Ugrasena's four billion bodyguards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't accept. Don't accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But we want them to accept. The point is, if we say to a scientific man, "There was four billion," and if our statement is wrong...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But our position is that if some portion we cannot understand, it is our incapability.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That is all right. But since we are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Unless we have got this faith we cannot use these <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> there are many such statements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, but we just want to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore many people, they do not accept <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span> So what can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We're just trying to understand it because we've never dealt with <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> before. We have been your disciples. But when we present this to the scientific community, because you have said that if one word is wrong, the whole philosophy is wrong, so they will say to us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them take it and throw out, don't read it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But then they discredit the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We don't like that when they discredit the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? They don't believe. What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, because we also want to know how did they have four billion personal servants just so that we'll be able to convince them and also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If a king has four billion servants, so it is not very astonishing. Why do you think that a king shall have only four servants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, there's only two billion people on the planet right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So where did they all go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say you don't believe, you don't take it. Why you are insisting on that point? If you don't believe, you don't take it. If you don't believe the whole book or the whole society, then who forbids you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We were hoping that there are some things which can be improved, because they have not been set up by you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You cannot improve. Whatever we are, we are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Why can we not improve it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no possibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then what is the use of action?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Action, whatever action we can do by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But we also have to make <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> society or farms or businesses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, when we shall do, we shall see to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But we are doing it. We are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We are doing it now, and that's the question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it in your own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We don't want to. We want to do everything Kṛṣṇa's way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop it. Stop it. I say stop it. You have come to me for my advice. I say you stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then, we say, what should we do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should do your business. That's all. Earn money and enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, I mean what should we do Kṛṣṇa consciously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give up Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I say. That is my advice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Why should we do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that I cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Isn't there a middle of the road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are finding so many faults, you give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No. We're not finding fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no other advance, alternative. No alternative. Either you accept or reject it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We accept, but we would like some instruction on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I have no such knowledge to convince you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, we accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Accept, or if you reject, reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We want to apply it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> We want to apply it to the world as it is now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no. You cannot. You are not authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, who is authorized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The authorized... You are not authorized. Who is authorized, that is not your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then what does it mean to become disciple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Disciple, if you don't like, give it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We do like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have already given up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If we didn't like it, we would not come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You have already given up. My disciples do not keep so many hair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Many of your disciples do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I don't accept that. You just this one circle, little. But those who are keeping big hairs, they are rejected from my disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> All right. That is clearing some things up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This is what we want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because then that is an unequivocal statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is, that you can, that anyone who is keeping hairs and not following the rules and regulations, they are rejected from second initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> What if they are keeping hair but they are following the rules and regulations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them follow. That's a good life. But from external features he must be a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> To get second initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Does that mean shaved head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when His students used to come without <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> so He refused to see his face. He refused to see his face. He said it is a crematory ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Why is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "why." If you accept it, accept. If you don't accept, leave us, leave us. There is no "why."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not following strictly. You cannot ask why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We could not ask why when we were following strictly either, Prabhupāda. So I'm sorry that it has to be this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our thing is that we have got some principles. If anyone cannot follow, then we don't accept him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Then what do you do with the rest of the world, except for the few people who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what I can do I am doing. Therefore you have no right to ask me. What is possible by me I am doing. And those who are able to follow, they are following. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But they cannot engage anyone else. How can you reach the intelligent class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is their business. That is not your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We are trying to be disciples, so we considered it our business because we are sincerely trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are bothering me? You do your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Because from you only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not accept you because you are keeping hairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I did not know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> You never told me that in Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I say, I'll repeat that anyone who is keeping long hairs, he is no more my disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the first condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Does that apply also for householder <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or is that simply for <span class="Italic">brahmacārī dharma?</span> Even you... I have pictures of you on the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> when you did not have shaved head, with a mustache when you were doing your business as a householder. So does that apply to householders, or only to <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> that a householder must also keep a shaved head or is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time I was not initiated. You were seeing my picture, mustaches, at that time I was not initiated. Since I became initiated, I have shaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, in India where one can do business...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can... Why you are bringing this question? You ask, "Why you had mustaches?" I say when I had mustaches, at that time, I was not initiated. That answer is given. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Can I ask one more question, Prabhupāda? What I would like to understand is why it is wrong to ask why? If I can just understand this, why it is wrong for us to ask you in a submissive way. We were humbly asking you these "whys," not because we are trying to be intimidating or we were trying to rebel, but because we have sincerely tried to understand as your disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you better ask my so many other disciples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They don't have any answers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no answer. I cannot attend so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We are not so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But these are the same questions which we have talked over with Revatīnandana Swami and Jayatīrtha. A great many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If my disciples, advanced students, cannot answer, then I am sorry. I cannot answer. I cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That we did not know. That we did not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now you know it. I have appointed so many GBCs because to help me. It is not possible to see everyone, individual. This is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But these are the same questions which they themselves are posing to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I have never met any other people who asked questions on the level that they are asking questions. I cannot answer many of their questions. I have studied all your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot. If you cannot, I cannot also. Because you have been taught by me, if you cannot, then it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We have also been taught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I have read your books, and I have heard you lecture. And so many things they are asking, I am, have no capacity to answer them. But you <span class="Italic">must</span> have the capacity because you know Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they want to ask you personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So that is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far I am not so able to answer. I admit my fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Oh, so then that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I understand. Okay? But they are saying, the general conception of you is that because you know Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can... You...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (interrupting) Excuse me. Because you know Kṛṣṇa, therefore you know everything about the material world and can answer all questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whatever I know I have explained in my books. Beyond that I have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If that is the case, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that does not diminish our respect for you in the least because we have always held...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what can I do? I say that whatever I have got experience, I am explaining in my books. I have explained. So it is not possible for me to answer every individual person. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We respect that. We understand. It is just that because they are saying these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got my advanced students. They can answer. If they are unable, answer, if you do not find answer from my books, then it is hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Ah! But your advanced students are saying if they give an answer that because they have been appointed by you, therefore their answer is perfectly correct, because, absolutely correct on all things in the relative world because, they have been appointed by you, and because you know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may... That's all right. If you don't believe them, you can finish business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But are they correct? That's what we want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That everything they say is the absolute truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what can I say? But I have no time to meet everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Is that correct, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I want to know very clearly that every word that anyone whom you have appointed says is completely correct on all things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they are authorized, it is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If they are authorized by you to be temple president...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Then when (name witheld) said to me that he wanted to have homosexual affair with me, I should have said, "Okay. Whatever you say." Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how to answer these questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That is what he said to me. And he was a <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> He is <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and he said to me, "I want to have sex with you." Does that mean that Kṛṣṇa was saying I should have sex with him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So you have to see whether it is according to our principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I'm asking you on a very practical... No. That is not what he said. He didn't say that. He said absolutely, and this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Then you should listen to everything he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I am. Because if I can judge then, if I can say, "Oh, at this point he is wrong," then that is what we are talking about, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That is the issue. If they are absolutely right all the time and they can make no error, they wield absolute power over our lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is (name witheld)? Where is (he)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He is across the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Has he said like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. I have witnesses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> But he's admitted his error.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's beside the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's all right. But that's not the point here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> The point is that Prabhupāda, that if you come before Prabhupāda for your own spiritual advancement, then it doesn't matter what other people are thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's not the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's not the crux of the matter at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The point here is not to criticize (him).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No. We did not come for that at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That wasn't the reason. The point is that anyone, (name witheld) or anybody else, he may be a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> but if he's doing all kinds of nonsense, how can we say that he has absolute authority? Because he was in charge of the place, etc., and he is also in an authoritative position, yet he breaks the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> His personal servant, when he came... His name is (name witheld). (He) instigated a homosexual affair with him. This boy came to surrender to Kṛṣṇa and surrendered to (him). But (he) told him to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> But Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Wait. I am not speaking with you. He said he did that and he did it in the name of his authority as a <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> So if you say, Prabhupāda, that everything that they say is absolutely true, then they will have absolute power and can do anything that they want, and anything that they say and any opinion they express is taken to be the same as yours, then it becomes implied that you agree with and condone such things, because they do them with absolute license. And we don't believe that to be true. So we think it is some kind of mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Everyone says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They do, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No, they don't. Śrīla Prabhupāda has said these things don't apply to you. Don't worry about them because you are not following the principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But they do say, and we are following and you don't know what we're doing, Satsvarūpa, because you haven't known me for two years. So you really don't know what I'm doing. You're not around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But our society is going nicely. It's not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In some respects it's going fine. But these are problems which can be dealt with amongst us, and they are affecting all of us. And for some people these are problems though they may not be for you. I think, as far as I know, your conduct has always been very honorable. But for some people who it's not and where these misconceptions apply, it's a real problem and we're trying to deal with it because it affects our lives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> The strength to deal with those problems comes from following <span class="Italic">sādhanācāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We are also attempting to follow <span class="Italic">sādhanācāra.</span> And if we are imperfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, if he has said so, that is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But is that then applying to everyone. Does someone who is in the adminis... (end)</div>
