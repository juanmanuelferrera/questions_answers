<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First business, how to get our books. (indistinct) For Russia export from India will be favorable. So government paper we are printing seven, eight rupees price. Make that addition, all the books. Ask them to take paper from the government, huge quantity, and all these books should be published immediately, 5,000 books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 5,000 copies each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if possible, minimum 1,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last time we were speaking, I was mentioning to you that in Russia they are particularly inclined towards an exchange program of books, where we give our books and they will give some useless books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct), why should we do this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned last time you will throw them away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For us there is no readable books in the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We cannot waste our time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, of course. But is there any, I mean, of course we would like to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But only some of the authorized books, just to take their parts(indistinct) and to refute, otherwise, we haven't got to take lesson from anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a fact. All rascal speculators, what value they have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Supposing there are many thousands of libraries in Russia and they are agreeable to placing say one of our books of each book in each of the libraries, but they are not willing to purchase all these books, but they are willing to give us some books in exchange, will we make this sacrifice? Because it will represent a loss of money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you can arrange for selling those (books) at any cost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can arrange to sell our books to them at any cost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, exchange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can sell, there is some set resale value. Then we can realize some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then it is alright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They'll have value. There will be some money. We can request them to send some samples of the books that they will return to us. Then we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out cost. Some shopkeepers, stores. Some return. If we can get our cost price of the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should get cost price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not should, but must as far as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I've heard that in Russia the people are so eager to read imported literature that any literature appears they immediately buy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a black market going on in Russia, particularly black market on books. Books are smuggled into the country and sold and they're very dearly read. People are very anxious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They must be because they are keeping in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These nasty countries, in the name of giving them material facility, they'll kill them, even they're independent. Such a horrible country. How people can tolerate loss of independence? It is very horrible. I am sitting here 24 hours, this is another thing, but if I understand that I cannot go out, I have to sit down here, oh it is horrible. It is a horrible condition. Simply this impression that I have to keep myself within this room, although I am keeping myself, I am not going, only for walk maybe. But if the impression is that I cannot go out from this room, then my life is lost. This is psychology. So, they are keeping their young men. They are not allowed to go out of the country, in Russia. Similarly in China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even more so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what kind of government it is? It is a horrible government. And they are hackney only in literature. These communist country, the people are forced to accept the government regulation. And that is all bad. I have seen in Moscow, generally the people are morose, their face not very happy. They are also Europeans, they want freedom to go here and there (indistinct) and to work. The taxi driver-first of all there is scarcity of taxi, you can not get taxi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Even in Moscow, big city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That Professor Kotofsky, I asked him, "Please arrange for a taxi." (indistinct) "Well, Swamiji, this is Moscow." So he came down to the gate-he was very virtuous-he showed me, "You go this way, actually there was 3 or 4 lane then you find a short lane, then you go this way, this way, then you get to your hotel. He showed me some short cut, personally. They... He could not call a taxi. And somewhere we went, we got a taxi, private taxi, and that man was begging for more than the fare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means the system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Can you not give me little more?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means the system is a failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then I could understand. And they have got that there is tourist bus, taking here and there, that bus is third class. Even less opulent than in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How many days were you there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Short. You were only in Moscow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is the rich city. People are fighting to get into that city, they only allow so many people to live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You cannot just decide to move to Moscow. You cannot do that. You must take permission from the government to live in Moscow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything..., and we could not get nice food. There was no nice rice, wheat, fruit, flour, nothing. Fruit means the strawberries. I don't remember we could get any other fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Perhaps you went at a bad season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everything is controlled. Whatever government will give you, they have to accept. And all the stores, it is just like, what is called? The old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Grocery store?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Antique, antique, antique shop. That means no purchaser. People have no p..., no bank. People have no money, simply bare necessities of life their government supplies. And bus transport, buses standing in one place, best time, and people are running after. Women, men, mostly they walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or bicycles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bicycle, I did not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I think they must all wear the same clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not study so much. Yes, there is no gorgeousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In China they all wear the same clothes. Whatever you saw in Russia, China is ten times more oppressive. It is much more oppressive. They say that Russia is a complete failure, because they are allowing so much looseness. The Chinese are accusing the Russians of being very loose and very capitalistic inclined. China is very dissatisfied that Russians have given up the principles of Marx and they have taken after the western ways. Preferring one group above another group.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Russia was afraid of another revolution. People were preparing. So much pressure, intolerance, after all they are Europeans, so there was a chance of revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Especially after Stalin. So many people were killed and sent to prison camps. That was the way that they enforced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stalin is calculated to be greatest criminal in the world. He has killed so many men. All rogues. We were taken through the neighborhood of all aristocratic men who were killed in the revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> While reading about China, one of the books I was reading also described Cambodia, Vietnam and Korea. And the recent histories of these countries are so horrible, that the... Mostly in that part of the world now they have become totally anti-American. They are very, very anti-American because of what the Ameri... The Americans have simply gone there and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Not Korea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> North Koreans don't love Americans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No, not north Koreans, South Koreans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now Korea is united.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, I've been reading, they hate the Americans in North Korea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Trivikrama has left Korea now, he went to... He's left. He's in Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He could not do anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I don't know, he has left there. He went for 3 weeks and left. Now he's in Japan. I don't know where. He's doing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he could not do anything, he can come back to America. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that it's good for him to come back to America. He's been away from America for 5 or 6 years now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let him come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He can preach in colleges. It would be a very purifying experience. Being by oneself for so long in that part of the world is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To remain alone is risky. (pause) Now China wants to control India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Also Russia. China would have attacked, they once attempted, American equipment. They are thinking, that because the officers are corrupt, the people are dissatisfied and if we go, they will welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Exactly correct. Oh yes, it's a perfect analysis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They believe that the... Of course it's a fact, the leaders are very corrupt, but the people want the change, that's what they believe. "And if we go, the people will work with us and overthrow this government and establish a true communistic government, a government for all the benefit the people." That's their idea. They feel that way about the whole world, the Chinese. They feel in America also-of course that's nonsense-but they think like that. That in America there is a huge working class and the working class are feeling oppressed. But that's nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think American working class are paid more than any country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The average income in the United States now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You know a man who lays bricks, a brick layer, in India he gets paid 10 rupees a day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Utmost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> And here he gets paid twelve dollars an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bricklayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, twelve dollars an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So one hundred dollars a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is impossible to engage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yeah, very expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Construction worker, just to build a simple building, they charge construction about nine dollars an hour, every man, minimum, unskilled man, nine dollars an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, how it will be possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were discussing this. The way to do it, is that you get some person... There are many persons all over the country who are knowledgeable, who can do the work, but who are friendly. Just like in many temples that I visited, they have people, professionals who are working, but they are young men and because they are friendly towards our society, they'll do the work for less money. I'm sure that there are people who can be found like that here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> American devotee, Asian, and Australian devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I think it can be done amongst our devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. We are not very anxious to get done immediately, we shall do slowly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So we are, me and Tamāla Kṛṣṇa, we have organized the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> here. The <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> should increase about ten times. Before they were doing three hundred dollars a day, now they should be doing at about one thousand three hundred dollars a day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Therefore I think if we have profit, fifty percent can go for books, and fifty percent can be banked. And when they have enough money, then we can build the temple. But it's the only question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, with what, whatever collection is there, fifty percent, go on. Why wait?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> And what about my collections in Japan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We also spent here for the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> 'Cause I will be getting nice collections this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I will bank it here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> It should come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The construction in Māyāpura...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> It's just that I don't have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have paid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From Rādhā-Dāmodara party?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were doing that, previous to the Māyāpura festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes are also promised (indistinct) you have to continue. There is no temple. Must be constructed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Do you think... Some of the devotees were expressing that maybe in the front would be better, then they could come in off the street. Otherwise they have to go around the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> If the building was built in the front, some people were thinking this might be a better spot because if there's no sun back here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> ...then it becomes very muddy there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the area here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Oh, it's bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bigger?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes. And they say these neighbors back here are the ones that do all the complaining. So some were expressing that this might be better, they could come in off the street. Also, many tourists come to Hawaii, and if we make it very nice, then they can, many tourist buses may come here to see the temple. So if it is near the gate then you'll come right out. But it's just that I have no knowledge how to build anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Myself, how to go about it. I don't have any experience or knowledge of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have no experience. I know, so that Australian boy who works constantly, there is one temple,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhāskara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Bhāskara, yeah he's in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can come and help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He'll be free pretty soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Someone has to organize for the construction though. That's the main thing, then later the inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Māyāpur they are completing the, um, that building? They had begun that long residential building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The one while we were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uhuḥ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I remember they were doing the first, ground floor, I think you told them to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are completing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the other side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That side also scheduled to begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And Bombay also has to be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So sufficient funds have to be sent for completing Bombay in 10 months' time and for those 2 buildings in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bombay, the slab is late, temple. Latest letter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. And the tower (indistinct). I think it will be finished earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any more news on the attempt of the government to take it back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government, I know it will be unable to take. They can not acquire temple, there is no such law. And even they acquire we shall say, alright take it. (indistinct) ...and the Hindus will... (indistinct) ...neglect, all right we will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A book should be written about the Bombay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that... One lady, Nirmala,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Dr. Singhal's wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she has already sent some article, why it is not published?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, whenever I see her she asks, "Why they don't publish?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and they inquire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we should start to make enquiry now throughout the world, how to push these books forward. Just as you are pointing out-sending books from India to Russia-in this way there may be so many arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Just find out what is the venues to push our books. As much as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I concentrate my time for this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, only. This will be your only business. All over the world, see how the books can be pushed. In their language or in English, now we have got several languages. You have seen the latest Portuguese edition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Spanish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spanish. You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give it to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's on the bottom shelf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last, last book, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew, very handsome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have done very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the idea. If books like this can be introduced, I'm certain that every single Spanish embassy around the world will take a book like this for their library. And there's plenty of them, there's many nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eventual standing order, in all the libraries. So they will take. And the get-up is so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Beautiful. Yeah, that book is nice, the color is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is printed in America also. American books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Printed in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> USA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> USA.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way if possible print in Russian language, in black market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's possible and they'll be eager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The young people are dissatisfied, young student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Small books print first of all, see. How the black market takes it, and then big books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is also all of the eastern European countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have got black market. There must be intermediate man who deals in black market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Get them. Let them make good profit. We want to put up, that's all. And let them take money, we don't mind. <span class="Italic">Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret.</span> When there is trickery, you become trickery. <span class="Italic">Śaṭhe śaṭhuṁ samācaret.</span> Kṛṣṇa's play, those who are plain, Kṛṣṇa is very kind and plain. Those who are tricky, "All right, I am also tricky." We shall adopt all the means of the materialistic persons, simply for Kṛṣṇa. [break] Just like Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rāsa</span> dance, any materialistic person at the dead of night will be glad to dance with young girls, what is the difference? [break] But because it was Kṛṣṇa's dancing, so this association of the woman and Kṛṣṇa is taken by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu as the first class worship. <span class="Italic">ramyā kācid upāsanā vraja-vadhū-vargeṇa yā kalpitā.</span> Kṛṣṇa should become a little tricky with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> "Oh, you have come in dead of night, what your husband, father would think, and there are so many (indistinct) and saintly (indistinct), please get out immediately." You have got that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Mm, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the gopīs were thinking "What this rascal says, say?" (chuckles) They are so sorry that, "We have come leaving everything and this rascal is giving us moral instruction." This is love, they can chastise Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...somehow or other, black market, white market, red market. Let them make... And as soon as there is taste, there will be very good demand. And this black marketeer will make profit and they'll do. This Chinese policy or the Russian policy will not stand. Simply we require to make ourselves strong. As soon as we become stronger than the communist movement, we shall finish it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Finish everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean attack them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I shall tell later. You become little strong. We cannot allow them. Because Kṛṣṇa's policy is, <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to take that policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Vṛndāvana, one day, on a walk you were saying that Kṛṣṇa's soldiers will walk all over the world and they will approach everyone and say, "Do you believe in Kṛṣṇa?" And if they say, "No," immediately, kill them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not kill them with weapon, but kill them by <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> They are already dead, so physically killing is for very big, big, strong man like Mao, or this Lenin, like that. Not common people, they have to be shown mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> More a question of revival, for the common people, more a question of revival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they allow us to forward our movement, then we are satisfied. And when there is hindrance, the person who is hindering, finished. But don't do it now, (chuckles) then you will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you think the time will come when we will...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Because Kṛṣṇa has two business, <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtam [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are for delivering all people. Anyone who will put hindrance, then we have to finish. Not small, big. That is going on all over the world, politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Cāṇakya Paṇḍita, he also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the way everywhere. [break] They will be automatically finished. Just like the Rāmakrishna Mission, who are advertising that they have got wonderful importance. They are now finished. They are simply making false propaganda in India. Actually, they have got fangs, what is called, fangs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The quality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Fangs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fangs, fangs. That is broken. So make... First of all try to push books, everywhere all over the world. They have got so many languages, like Russian or... Blackmarket. Chinese also. Blackmarket, they cannot check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, no, and you don't need permission either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And there's more profit too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In black market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah yes, if there is demand, then you will make good profit also. And there will be demand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They'll be big demand for your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very big, very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) They sent one translation of Tulasi dāsa's <span class="Italic">Rāma-caritra-mānasa.</span> It was sold, all, in a week. And therefore they have stopped now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> It is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They sent (indistinct), <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes I wonder that-of course we want our books to be translated by our own men-but in the absence of sufficient translators...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...that thing you see that er, our men means they know the philosophy. Otherwise they do not know, that is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Supposing we have-I'm just using this hypothetical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any, "our man" who knows Russian language, he should check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Professionals may translate, but one of our men may check?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, just like our books are being done in Germany now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Yeah, then you can have quite a few books translated. Because if we only depend on our men for the entire translating work, it will never get done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, then get professional man, but he may not create the havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, he must be checked by someone who knows. Whew, this is exciting. I'd love to see your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the most widely read blackmarket book in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that will create revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whew. These books are very revolutionary. You are very strong. You have put everything in a very clear-cut, strong words. You have attacked everyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, as fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) This is fact, it is not exaggeration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In your article in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> about Marx, you call him a nonsense, you call Marxism nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, what is his philosophy? (sic:) Dialectitude?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dialectic Materialism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, we have written one Dialectic Spiritualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Harikeśa's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harikeśa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he read it to us. He's preaching, I think in Eastern Europe sometimes. We got a report. Has he written you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I heard that, but is he being alright or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From the report it appears that he goes occasionally into some eastern European countries. Mostly he's concentrating in England, Germany and Scandinavias. He has a party and they are doing speaking engagements and distributing books. And sometimes he went in which countries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Budapest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is going to some communist European countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They make their vans with false bottoms and they hide the books underneath so at the border they do not see. Underneath the van is all your books. When they get in the country then they distribute the books to these centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sometimes he said when he's speaking, the translator will not say what he is saying because it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes he forgets-usually he speaks very carefully-guarded words. But once or twice he says, he starts speaking direct Krishna consciousness and the translator looks at him and won't translate it into the local language. Sometimes he forgets himself and starts speaking about Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the translator suddenly looks at him. Usually he covers everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has done a good job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He is a fit person, very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in this way... You are all intelligent, you can plan. The aim is how to distribute books. That is first consideration. [break] In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is very figuratively described that we have got this body and the different parts. Just like Arjuna is sitting on the chariot. There is chariot driver, there are horses, reins. There is field, and the arrow, and the bow. They have been figuratively. So this can be used for killing the enemies of our Kṛṣṇa Consciousness and then give up all this paraphernalia, chariot, we... Just like after fighting, only victory, then you kill them. And similarly this body is there, the mind is there, the senses are there. So utilize it for conquering over this material existence. And then give up this body and go back to home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Does the devotee, I mean just like you are always enthusing us to push on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sharpening your weapons. That is also described. By serving the spiritual master, you keep your weapon always sharpened. And then take help from Kṛṣṇa, the words of spiritual master sharpen weapon and <span class="Italic">yasya prasādad bhagavata...,</span> and the spiritual master is happy, then Kṛṣṇa immediately will help. He gives you strength. Suppose you got a sword, sharpened sword. But if you have no strength, what will you do with the sword? Kṛṣṇa will give you the strength, how to fight and kill the enemies. Everything is described. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu (said) <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">,</span> make your weapon sharpened by the instruction of the spiritual master and then Kṛṣṇa will give you strength, you'll be able to conquer. This figurative explanation I think last night I did. Here is a verse, <span class="Italic">acyuta bala, acyuta bala.</span> Is Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (calls out) Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are soldiers of Kṛṣṇa, servants of Arjuna. Simply you will have to act accordingly, then you will finish up enemies. They have no power, although their number is hundred times. Just like Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas. They have no power, <span class="Italic">yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ [Bg. </span>18.78]<span class="Italic">.</span> Keep Kṛṣṇa in your side, then everything will be successful. <span class="Italic">Tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtiḥ.</span></div>
