<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You lead them, Gargamuni. The other men can stand out here (?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Move in. Move in more. O.K. Some men can come through the other room and stand out here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Those <span class="Italic">prabhus</span> are going to have to go around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You lead them, Gargamuni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get this fan on. Fan and lights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fan and lights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Em.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> On behalf of all the <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span> and Rādhā Dāmodara, we'd like to offer you this <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know, if Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">virāḍ-rūpa,</span> so big mouth, so big belly, that, whatever you give, that is not sufficient. So here we are spreading Kṛṣṇa's mouth very widespread. Here is the plan for Māyāpura temple. This is the.... This is only residential quarter. Real temple is not yet constructed. It will occupy 350 acres of land. So you are the pillars of this construction work. We are doing all your construction work on your contribution. So go on preaching and distributing books. If we get the.... We are.... Books are.... As your pushing on the sale is very nice, then the customers are also there. These are American Express? No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Barclay's Bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now everyone is issuing these traveler's check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But these are issued differently. In American Express, they charge some money, but these are freely given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> Then why the American Express will remain if people will go there? Free service to the constituent, those who are customer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think even to those who are not the constituents also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> The public also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This happens to be our bank that we deal with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Barclay Bank is big bank, American bank.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This Ādi-keśava Swami, his grandfather is Mr. Barclay. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is grandfather's bank?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Great-uncle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Great-uncle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are Mr. Barclay also? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Different name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our.... They are accommodated in how many buses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Currently in six buses and six airports, because Tripurāri Mahārāja leads about twenty-five men distributing in different airports around the country, and then there's another hundred men who are working out of six buses. Now two more buses are being built to accommodate everyone. And then another ten men are working at our bus construction head office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, of course, you are not going to be absent for many, many days. You come and go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There won't be any difficulty, because every...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trained up. That is the.... Training, that is the real perfection. Our Tripurāri Mahārāja is there, and Viṣṇujana Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And Ādi-keśava Mahārāja is very expert, and Madhudviṣa Swami will be helping them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee's one qualification is <span class="Italic">dakṣa, dakṣa,</span> expert. Out of the twenty-six qualifications, a devotee is always very expert in dealing. It is not that because they have left anything material, they do not know how to deal with material things. Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī did it. Perhaps you know the story. Political. Although he had nothing to do with material things, when there was a political game (gain?) he tackled it very nicely when he was young man. But devotee, although not interested in material things, but for Kṛṣṇa's sake they deal with material things very expertly. That should be the qualification of a devotee, expert. Not that "I have nothing to do with these material things." No.</div>
<div class="Verse">prāpañcikatayā buddhyā<br class="calibre2"/>hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo<br class="calibre2"/>vairāgyaṁ phalgu kathyate</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The devotee's vision is: in everything there is Kṛṣṇa. That is a fact. Just like we are using this dictaphone and tape record. It is material things. Sometimes they accuse that "You are against material things. Why you are using these material advantages?" Do they not? You do not meet such men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But for us there is nothing material. We have no such vision as "material" and "spiritual." Material means when we forget Kṛṣṇa's right. That is material. Everything is Kṛṣṇa's. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is the proprietor; He is the enjoyer. So, <span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā, īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Everything Kṛṣṇa's. So when we forget Kṛṣṇa's right on everything, that is material. Otherwise there is nothing material; everything spiritual. Everything is generated by Kṛṣṇa's energies, and there are two energies, material energy and spiritual energy. So in the material energy, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is less or nil. And in spiritual energy, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is prominent and very acute. I think I give this example somewhere. Just like this nail, and just little below, there is skin. Both of them are my body, but in the skin there is sensation; in the nail there is no sensation. But both of them are coming from the same source, the body. Similarly, everything is Kṛṣṇa's. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ.</span> Everything is Bhagavān but appears like different to the different vision. Therefore we take everything.... <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Everything..., in everything there is Kṛṣṇa's relationship. So there is no question of giving it up. Why shall I give it up? This is Kṛṣṇa's property. Why shall I give it up, <span class="Italic">prāpañcikatayā buddhyā,</span> by mistaking it as material? <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> So these Māyāvādīs, they say the <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā:</span> "This material world is false, and Brahman is reality." And we don't say that. Everything is reality because it comes from reality. When it is not used for Kṛṣṇa, that is unreality. It is not properly being used. Otherwise there is no such thing as unreality, because it is coming from reality. So why shall I give it up, <span class="Italic">tyāga</span>? Neither <span class="Italic">tyāga,</span> neither <span class="Italic">bhoga.</span> Everything utilize for Kṛṣṇa. This is our way. Any question on this regard? I saw your wife also. She is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. She is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Practically all of these devotees are so much dedicated to book distribution that they are going out now nearly seven days a week, without stoppage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Utsāhān.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt<br class="calibre2"/>tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt<br class="calibre2"/>saṅga-tyāgāt sato vṛtteḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Upadeśāmṛta </i>3]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Italic">Utsāha</span> is the basic principle, <span class="Italic">utsāhān</span> and <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">,</span> association of <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> Simply <span class="Italic">utsāhān</span> and the association is not <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>-then it is material. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān</span> means association of <span class="Italic">sādhu. Sādhu</span> means devotee. <span class="Italic">Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Who is <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>? <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> One who has no other business than to serve Kṛṣṇa, he is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> So the association of such <span class="Italic">sādhu.... Sādhu, sato vṛtteḥ sādhu-saṅge.</span> Whatever a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> does, there is no fault. Everything is right. But still, because we are in this material world, we shall act in such a way that nobody can accuse us. <span class="Italic">Sato vṛtteḥ. Sādhu</span> is above all this <span class="Italic">vṛtti,</span> but still, you keep pace with the material world, otherwise your activities will be hampered. Therefore Rūpa Gosvāmī has said <span class="Italic">sato vṛtti:</span> "The dealings should be very honest." <span class="Italic">Sato vṛtteḥ sādhu saṅge, ṣaḍbhiḥ,</span> six items. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān,</span> enthusiasm; <span class="Italic">dhairyāt,</span> patience. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān dhairyāt niścayāt,</span> with confidence. So enthusiasm, patience, confidence. <span class="Italic">Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.</span> You have to act according to the prescribed way, and <span class="Italic">sato vṛtteḥ,</span> and dealings very honest, and <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything perfect. So where you all staying? In new quarters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we have been very fortunate. They have given us.... Just as you have this wing, they have given us the whole wing on the next floor above.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's very comfortably situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything, water supply, everything is there? In the beginning I thought that "Such a big building. Who will come and live here?" (laughter) It is that Matsyāvatāra. You know Matsyāvatāra? <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-mīna-śarīra, jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> That one <span class="Italic">muni,</span> he took water in his pot. He saw a fish. So after some time he saw the fish has grown, that it cannot be kept in that <span class="Italic">kamaṇḍalu.</span> Then he gave more space. Then after some, he saw, He has.... "It is filled up." Again more, again more. Then he threw it in the ocean, and again still big. (chuckles) That is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Pralaya-payodhi-jale dhṛtavān asi vedam **.</span> And who knows this song,</div>
<div class="Verse">pralaya-payodhi-jale dhṛtavān asi vedaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vihita-vahitra-caritram akhedam<br class="calibre2"/>keśava dhṛta-mīna-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare<span class="Italic"> **</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">Similarly Varāha-mūrti also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda? When I was very young, in the house I was living in.... My friend, his father was from Louisiana, where they have many alligators. This was in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Louisiana means near, around Florida.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Alligators, crocodiles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Crocodile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So one day his father brought him two little crocodiles as a pet back to New York, where we were living. So he was keeping them in the bathtub. But just as you described, they started to grow, and eventually they became so big that he had to keep them in the house, and then they were running. And anyone that would come in, they would run. (laughter) Finally they had...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very ferocious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had to give them to the zoo. New York Zoo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I understand they can be tamed also. Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Miami where I grew up, they used to have a crocodile fight. What they would do, they would feed the crocodiles until they were completely sleepy; then they would fight with them, so they couldn't move around so good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Sometimes they take their teeth out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what remains? The teeth is dangerous. Yes, how condemned life. And we had to pass through all these. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi.</span> Nine <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of forms in the water. Crocodile is one of these. Just see how accurate is Vedic information. Never says "ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span>" or "eight <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span>" Nine <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Now, if you don't believe, count. Go ahead. Count. How this knowledge is there? Nobody can go within the water to count how many forms are there, but how the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> gives the knowledge perfectly? <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi.</span> This is Vedic knowledge. Where you cannot reach and you refer to <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> you'll get the knowledge. That is <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> perfect knowledge. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu has given the example: stool is impure, rejectable. Everyone knows. <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says, "No, cow dung is pure." And you examine it; you'll find it is pure. That is Vedic knowledge. When you get information from the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> it is perfectly right. So it is easier to take knowledge from the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Then you'll become perfect in knowledge. There is no question of researching. That is not possible. What you'll research? How many animals are there, aquatics are there, in the water? It is beyond your experience. Is there any scientist who can go within the water and count how many aquatic forms are there? Nothing you can do. <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣā viṁśati.</span>(?)What information we have got? Even you cannot speak perfectly well about this universe. We are not able even to speak perfectly what is there in the moon planet. They are going, trying to go, and coming back. And still, they are claiming perfection as perfect as God. Just see how lunatic they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that the newly initiated <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> have to come now. Maybe we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So some meeting is not going to be held down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there's constantly <span class="Italic">kīrtanas</span> and discourses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lectures and <span class="Italic">kīrtanas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtanas.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu's soldier to fight with <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are our commander-in-chief, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself says, <span class="Italic">ekākī āmāra nāhi pāya bolo.</span> When He.... In <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> you have seen? In the first part you can find out this verse, <span class="Italic">ekākī āmāra nāhi pāya bolo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's a song like that also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says it may be in a song also, one of the Vaiṣṇava songs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The first part. Here, this is first part of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Look in the index.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Index. You can read it. So you are reading books also. Not selling but reading also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really they are soldiers because many of them have been very severely beaten by police authorities and others during the distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The men who are here now in this room, some of them have been put in jails.... (aside:) Watch out for that thing. Put in jails and beaten just for distributing these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no legal action?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's in the courts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Some places the police have a conspiracy against our devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is our fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> We have no fault except that we are successful. We are so successful, and they are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they don't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The people want, but the authorities don't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have found out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I.... The index is not there, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no index?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No index. First chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how you'll find it? Give me. Unless you have an index, list.... The purport of the verse is that even Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu-He is God himself, Kṛṣṇa Himself-He felt, alone, unable to do this task. He felt. So this is the position. You are cooperating; therefore I am getting the credit. Otherwise alone what could I do? <span class="Italic">Ekākī āmāra nāhi pāya bolo.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu Himself wanted our cooperation. He is God, Kṛṣṇa. And therefore cooperation is very important thing. Nobody should think that "I have got so great ability. I can do." No. It is simply by cooperation we can do very big thing. "United we stand; divided we fall." This is our.... So be strong in pushing on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and Kṛṣṇa will help. He is the strongest. Still, we must be combined together. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana. Saṅkīrtana</span> means many men combined together chanting. That is <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Otherwise <span class="Italic">kīrtana. Saṅkīrtana. Bahubhir militvā kīrtayeti saṅkīrtana.(?) Bahu. Bahu</span> means many, many combined together. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, combined together. All nations, all persons they should combine together. There is hope in our society, combination. There are Hindus; there are Muslims; there are Christians; there are black, white. Combine them. That looks very beautiful, just like combination of many flowers. There is black flower also. It looks nice, very nice. Each and every flower take alone; it is not beautiful, but when they are combined together, it looks very beautiful. It is attractive. And that is wanted. Because from the spiritual platform we are all working. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Spiritual platform, every one of us, we are servant of Kṛṣṇa. So where is the competition between one servant with another? There is.... Even there is competition, the center is Kṛṣṇa-"Who can serve more?" Therefore that competition is very welcome, because there is no personal interest. Everyone is trying how to serve Kṛṣṇa more. That is wanted. The competition is there in his real form and perverted form. In the real form Kṛṣṇa is the center, and the perverted form, I am the center. I compete with you to satisfy my senses more. What is called? Heliocentric or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Egocentric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Egocentric, yes. This is egocentric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It should be Kṛṣṇa-centric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then it is perfect. The competition must remain. The others, they say, "Why competition? Make it zero." That is imperfect. But competition to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, that is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I found the verse. It's in <span class="Italic">"Ohe Vaiṣṇava Ṭhākura."</span> <span class="Italic">Ekākī āmāra nāhi pāya bolo, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtane.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, not this verse. What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Meaning is, "I do not find the strength to carry on alone the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> of the holy name of Hari. Please bless me by giving me just one drop of faith with which one can attain the great treasure of the holy name of Kṛṣṇa."</div>
