<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is such proposition that He should exist, He should not exist. Then there must be some authority to give such order. That is answered in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says: <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10],</span> "Under My superintendence, nature is working." <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He also says that the species are not created independently. They say it is descended from, one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if there is no question of independence, then how, abruptly, he can begin from a certain species? You must explain wherefrom this species came into existence. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There are so many books on Darwin's theory. Goes... In the library, if one goes there are hundreds of volumes of books on Darwin's theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have accepted or protested?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mostly they accept and there are some who are also very critical, what they're, what he's saying is really (indistinct) But those are very few. Mostly, most books are supporting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Recently, there was an issue that some people wanted that the theory that God created the earth and the species to be taught in schools along with Darwin's theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the, it was defeated because the scientists said: "If we make such a statement in our schools, everyone will take us as fools."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? I could not follow. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The evolution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A group of, a group of people wanted that in school they should also teach that God created the earth and the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Not just say that it was created by chance, random biology. But scientists objected, said: "We cannot say that God created the earth because then everyone will take us as fools." And they defeated the measure. The scientists said "Everyone knows. The earth is just created by biological chemistry. If we say that God created the earth, everyone will think us as fools."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The biology, chemistry, why don't you create? The biology and chemistry has advanced so much. Why don't you create? What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. Why future? If it is already created, biology and chemistry, and you know the process, why don't you create it by chemistry, biology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's very wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is a little wet, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's all wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I do not wish to come here. There is no facility for walking. Everywhere wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Ahh. This is wet also. Let's go this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere wet. There is a little space to walk. Biology, chemistry is the origin of life. So the chemistry, biology's so much advanced. Why they cannot create life? When the crucial point is touched, they say: "We shall do it in future." Why future? If it is already done at present, why future? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is... Small ones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> These are some small earth, mound of earth taken out from the inside to make room for oxygen for the plants to breath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. These are stools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, these are not stools, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's a machine. They go around like this. And that makes a little earth taken out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahhh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say they'll be doing in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. Future, that is not science. Trust no future, however pleasant. This is the word. What is this? Everyone will say future. Trust no future, however pleasant. You may think it is very pleasurable. Why future? If you say that the biology, chemistry is the beginning of this life, so you are now so much advanced. Why don't you create? Then what is the meaning of your advancement? You're talking nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They always say they're right on the verge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They always say they're right on the verge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also the future, in a different way. You have to accept that you do not know still what is the truth. You are expecting in future. That, that is the proof that your knowledge is imperfect. Why future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because their present knowledge cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is, it is something like, giving post-dated check. I pay you one lakh of rupees, post-dated. Although I have no money,... What is the value of that check? Will anybody accept that check? "Oh, I have received the money." That is foolishness. Why future? You are talking of future, and you are talking of perfectness at present. What is this nonsense? You are claiming that your science is perfect, and, at the same time, when practical example wanted, you say; "I shall do it." The same example. I am saying I am millions, owner of millions of dollars. And you ask me: "Give me some payment." "Yes, I give you post-dated check." Will you accept? At present, if you give me five dollar, I see something tangible. And you're talking of big, big word, but you'll pay me in the future. So is it very sanguine proposal? And I am to accept it? So what kind of intelligent man I am also? You cannot produce even a grass by biological chemistry. You cannot do anything. Still you are claiming: "It is produced of chemistry, biology." What is this nonsense? Nobody questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Even it's produced by chemistry, there's laws...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There's laws to those chemical reactions. They never consider who makes the laws?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is this? As soon as there is law, it must be considered that somebody made the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's just a thief's mentality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> If a thief comes on something valuable, he does not think who owns this. He simply thinks how he'll steal it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is thief's business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are all thieves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how we, a sane man can trust a thief? A sane man cannot trust a thief. There are so many things. They could not produce even a grass, even a small plant in the biology, chemistry laboratory, and still they're claiming it is product of biology, chemistry. What is this nonsenses. What kind of scientists there are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Locana:</span> We couldn't even choose when we were born.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Locana:</span> We couldn't even choose being born here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Locana:</span> So where is the question of control?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is why, in the ultimate analysis, the geologists, mostly when they trace the origin of life, they say everything started from matter. Living matters came out from non-living matters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is coming now? It came in the past and not in the now, and not at present? Wherefrom an ant is coming from this dust. Is there any proof? Even an ant does not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In fact, there are several theories like that, about the origin of life. And they say starting from matter, all the living matters came from nonliving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Why it is not coming now, rascal? I kick on your face with boots. Why it is not coming now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> If it happened before, it should happen now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And it is so amazing that people believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmā:</span> The blind leading the blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> All rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍhāḥ.</span> Our simple formula is: Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's a rascal. Never mind what he is. We immediately reject him, a rascal. Our simple formula. And actually they're rascals. They're talking like rascals, childish, that life came from matter. Prove it. That future. What is this? I am very rich man. And as soon as I ask you: "Give me some money." "Oh, yes, I'll give you in future." What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sometimes when we ask someone to become a life member, they say: "Yes, sometime in future." We become very disappointed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall make vigorous propaganda against all this rascalism. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhāḥ.</span> Challenge them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Saying "In future", that is a bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bluff. That is a bluff. When that future will come? That they do not know. That is another bluff. And still, they're proud of advancement of knowledge. Still, they're talking of future. And what is your advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So long as the future is there they have a voice to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Future we cannot trust. Trust no future however pleasant. This is our philosophy. Everyone says that. Trust no future, however pleasant. You may talk that future is very bright, but we don't believe in that. Why future? If you are advanced, immediately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's old poetry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the past, you say, in the past the life came out of matter. Why you again say in the future? What is this theory? You have already committed that the life began from matter. That is past, "began." Then why you say now again "future?" Then where is the beginning? Eh? Why this contradiction? If life began from matter, that is past. That is in the past. Then why do you say again future? What is the answer? Is it not contradiction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yeah. That misses the whole point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is whole, wholesale nonsense, wholesale nonsense. You are expecting the fact in the future, still you say it began in the past. Just see the contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. (Someone hits golf ball.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Golfers:</span> Fore, fore!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So contradiction means childish. Contradiction is not scientist. Contradiction is childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They started from a point where...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They started from a point where there's no background. There's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No background. That is another thing. And still, they cannot prove it at present. They're expecting to prove it in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say: "It happened in the past, but we'll do it in the future."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But who did it in the past?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how, how he knows that it began in the past? If he cannot prove it in the present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They assume it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They assume it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Assume, everyone can assume. That is not science. Assuming, then, everyone can suggest something like. You can suggest something, I can suggest something. What is the proof? We can prove that life begins from life. Just like father begets a child. Father is living and the child is living. That we can prove. But where is your proof that the father is a stone and the son is a child? Where is your proof? We say that life begins from life. The original life is Kṛṣṇa. That we can prove. But you say that life begins from matter. Where is this evidence that a child is born out of stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There's a miss... They say there's a missing link.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A missing link? Then I kick on your face. You're missing this kick. Now learn it. Nonsense. Here is the missing point. Just learn it. Write vigorous articles to kick on the face of these rascals. All of you. You have got so much advanced laboratories, advanced knowledge. You do not... even you are defying the authority of God. You have become so great. And you cannot prove that life is coming out of matter. That you are leaving aside for future. And I have to believe such a rascal? Do you think it is nice? You are talking all nonsense, and I have to believe you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say they have almost proof that some acids, they make some acids and it's almost like an animal. Just about, not quite, but almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Asses, asses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Amino acids.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Asses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say if they isolate certain amino acids, it's almost like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're almost like components of protein.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They're almost like little animals, little cells. Not quite but almost. So they say that because that matter is almost like a little animal, therefore there must be just one little missing link, one chemical you can add, they're trying to isolate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That missing link is kicking you. That missing... Here, you say, you take this missing link.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are trying to make babies in a test tube.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In a few years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that test tube?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the laboratory, the chemical laboratory, biological laboratory, so they'll take the combinations of the male and the female....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the test tube? It is taken from the living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the test tube? Test tube is a place for combination. As it is combined in the womb. So that is not advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The womb's already doing it very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nicely. What is your credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They want to, they want to be very proud that they'll be able to do it outside the womb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that's all right. At least you are not able to do it now. But where is the credit because it is already being done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the nature's test tube.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They're just doing it in a more difficult and expensive way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When somebody does like that, people will give him Nobel prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata:</span> <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> A big animal is being praised by dogs, and hogs, camel, monkeys. So they're getting Nobel Prize from dogs, hogs, camels. They're not getting Nobel Prize from any sane man. That is stated. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ. Śva</span> means dog. <span class="Italic">Viḍ-varāha</span> means the stool-eater, hog. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāha uṣṭra. Uṣṭra</span> means camel. And <span class="Italic">kharaḥ</span> means ass. So they're being praised by these classes of animal. They're not human being. If anyone gives Nobel Prize to such rascals, that means the man, the committee, who is giving the Nobel Prize to him, they are composition of these animals, dogs, hogs, camel and ass. They are not human being. According to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> I think I have explained it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not... We don't accept them as human beings. We accept them as animals. So one animal is being praised by other animals. That's all. And that is no credit. That means if, at the present, if anyone gets Nobel Prize, that means he's fool number one. That is the... Because the other animals are praising. No human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But that is the ultimate aim for the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Scientists means they are rascals. They're talking nonsense. And because they are putting the matter in some jugglery of words, other fools are being misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That Nobel Prize, the Nobel, he's the one who discovered the dynamite which has caused so much destruction in the world. But he made a big fortune. So all that money, he's now pushing for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He created some misfortune, and he spent the money for creating further, more misfortunes. What can he do more? Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (Pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It says in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> that the demoniac, they do acts, horrible acts which are meant to destroy the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Ugra-karma. Kṣayāya jagato 'hitāḥ.</span> It is meant for destruction and inauspicity of the world. This is their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Locana:</span> If scientists really believed that they were just made out of matter, then there wouldn't be any question of one scientist's thinking he's a person better than another person cause there wouldn't be any individuality, if they believed everything was just atoms and matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Now here is a matter. Why leaves and twigs are not coming. Formerly it was coming. What is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Locana:</span> The spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same, it has grown green, and vegetation. Now the same wood is there. Why it is not coming now? Let scientists explain this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That simply shows how ignorant the understanding is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Therefore we say rascals, simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well they would say the chemical composition has been changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, give the chemicals. You are now advanced in knowing the chemicals. Inject the chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda: :</span>Knowledge means that you have to be able to demonstrate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. That... Otherwise what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda: :</span>Otherwise, its' just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācaraṇa.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">ācaraṇa. Āpani ācari bhakti karila pracāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They should be able to demonstrate it in a laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Science says that: "observation and experiment." That is science. You observe how things are going on. And you experiment. Then it is perfect. But you cannot make experiment, you simply observe, that, a child also can also observe, and he can speak something nonsense. Just like in our childhood, we were observing the gramophone box, that within the box there is some man who's singing. And electric fan. I was thinking: There must be some ghost. Yes. These kind of suggestion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>The... In the first time when learn about the difference between the living and the nonliving, this is one of the very popular questions when we start biology: What is the difference between living and the nonliving? So they answer there are several points to differentiate between the two. And they say the living can move and the nonliving cannot grow or cannot move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> And the living can reproduce like themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The nonliving is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>But they never talk about the soul, the nature of the soul, the consciousness existing within the living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No, because there is consciousness, therefore the living being can create. Because I am conscious, I am thinking of marrying, begetting children. Because I am conscious. And because there is no consciousness, therefore this wood cannot think that he'll beget. The original consciousness, in the Vedas<span class="Italic">,</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">eko bahu syām.</span> God says: "I'll become many," so because there is consciousness, therefore He's saying that: "I shall become many." Without consciousness, there is no question of by-products. (Pause) Now they are supplying water to these green trees. Why they do not supply to that wood, and get it green?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>'Cause from experience they know that it is not going to grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means nonsense, that there is something else. Because the same tree, now it is growing, watering, but when it will be dead, you pour water... The medicine is the same. Why it is not doing now, and why it was doing formerly? Then what is the thing that is lacking in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda: :</span>Similarly, if there's a dead body and they just add some chemicals, that doesn't necessarily mean it will come alive again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No. No. Chemicals are already there. If you say that the chemical is the cause of life, that chemicals are there. Because other lifes are coming. How do you say the chemical is wanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Don't they say that when death means chemicals are gone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...breakdown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The life, the life energy, the heart...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No, no. Life energy, what is the cause of that life energy? Chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda: :</span>Chemicals remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. So that chemical is already there. Life energy is there. Because from the body, thousands of microbes are coming out. They're living entities. So you cannot say that the life energy is lacking there. No, it is already there. How can you say that life energy not there? Otherwise, how other life is coming. Not only one, thousands. So how do you say the life energy's lacking there? What do you think, Karandhara Prabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara: :</span>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>The life energy's already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara: :</span>Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say the life energy's not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>But the life energy for the dead body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>For the dead body means, that is a particular dead body. It is not the life energy. That is individuality. The life-energy-producing chemicals are already there. But that particular individual living entity has left. Just like I live in a room. So I leave this room. You cannot find me. But there are many other living entities there. There are ants, there are spider, there are so many. So that does not mean because I have left that room, it is lacking the accommodations. The accommodation is there. Other living entities are living there. I have left. I am individual. I have left. Therefore the individual soul is proved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They do not know how that life energy comes or goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Life energy comes or... There is no question of coming and going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well coming into a body and leaving a body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means that is individual. That individual person is missing. He has left it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Generally they conclude that it's an electro-chemical energy in the heart and that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. That individual person has left. Other things are intact. Otherwise, how the living entities are coming out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They don't think that if it's simply a chemical, why cannot they just get a chemical that's a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We refute that. The chemicals are already there. Otherwise how living entities are coming out? We don't say that chemical is missing. Because the same theory: conservation of energy. The chemicals, the energy-producing, that is already there. It may be in different form, but the life-producing-energy is there. Otherwise how the other living entities are coming out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In a living, in a living entity in the living body, there are so many things, personality...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got personality, all the living entities coming out, the microbes. They have got their personality. If they're moving in this way, you stop. They'll move in this way.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"There is some block. Let me go this side." So there is personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But in the dead body, there's no personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means that individual person has left. That is the proof, that is the proof of individual soul. Just like there are so many plants of the same species. One is dead. That individual plant is dead, but other species are living. It is not extinct. How can you say the species is extinct? How you can say? Darwin's forefather might be extinct. But the monkeys are there. What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Six-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Six thirty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. We can walk little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But in the same living body, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are innumerable small living entities. Like the cells themselves. They are living also.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In my body, there are millions of living entities. In my intestines, there are so many worms. If they, if they become stronger, then whatever you eat, they eat it. You don't take any benefit out of it. Therefore those who are full with these hookworms, they eat very much, but they do not grow. They become lean and thin. But they are very much hungry because these living entities are eating, and he's feeling hungry. And he's eating, but he cannot take any benefit out of it. He's lean and thin. So already there are thousands and millions of living entities in my body. But they are individual, I am individual. I may be proprietor of this garden, but there are many millions of living entities living in this garden. Similarly I may be proprietor of this body, but many millions of living entities are living in my body. I know that. Otherwise, how hookworms coming out of my intestines? So you cannot say that the chemical is lacking. Chemical is not lacking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So when you take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> the living entities which are within our body, they're also taking <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are very benevolent. You take Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> for others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Welfare work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you can do without taking Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Because you have got stool and urine within your body, and there are many germs. They're eating that. You need not make a separate endeavor to feed them. (pause) The individual soul is never lost. That is our philosophy. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin.</span> He's simply changing different body under different circumstances. That's all. The soul, individual soul, is never lost. Neither he takes birth, neither he dies. He's simply changing the garments. This is perfect theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So when they think nicely, there's no reason why they don't accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are not nice men. They are rascals. They're not even gentlemen. A gentleman will have some shyness, some shame. But they're shameless. They cannot answer properly, still, shamelessly, they claim they're scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They're expert bluffers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're not even gentlemen. At least, I take them like that. They're talking that in the past, from matter, living force came, and when I ask them: "Why don't you produce?", "Oh, that we shall do in the future." Why? You have already experienced in the past, and you cannot do it, and you are leaving the matter for future. So they're shameless. Not even ordinary gentlemen. Shameless. That in talking all this nonsense. That is my charge. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. They're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shameless. Shameless men. We cannot say even gentlemen. A gentleman will be shameful, ashamed to speak something nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They do not think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are not human being. A human being thinks twice before saying anything. Animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> And all the innocent, they're all misled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is, that is our protest. That you remain a rascal at home. Why you are misleading others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're spoiling themselves, but, not only that, they want to spoil others also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their business. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> (pause) Kṛṣṇa so easily simplifies the matter. They'll not accept it. <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptir... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> In two lines, he solves the whole biological problems. In two lines. That is knowledge. Minimum words, maximum solution. That is knowledge. And talking nonsense and no meaning. Books, volumes of books, talking nonsense and there is no meaning. Is that knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Like the wolves, they bay: "Ohhh, ooow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The frogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The frogs, croaking, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ca ca canh, ca ca canh, ca ca canh, ca ca canh, ca ca canh... That's all. They're thinking: "Oh, we're talking very nicely." The result is the snake, they find out here is a (unclear). Pop. Finish. So this ca ca canh, scientists, means when death comes, oh, everything's finished. That's all. All their ca ca canh, scientific investigation, finished. And he becomes a dog, cat and something like that. That's all. Therefore <span class="Italic">mūḍhāḥ.</span> They do not know that "I have got this valuable life, human form of life, advanced intelligence. I'll have to take lesson from Kṛṣṇa, and make my life successful." They do not know that. Ca ca canh, ca ca canh, ca ca canh, ca ca canh. And then die, and become again. When he dies, there is no question of science and talking nonsense. That is under the grip of nature. "Yes, come on. Enter this body. Finished." Just like the rascal rogue. He's very much proud of his strength. And the police comes arrest: "Come on. Enter this custody. Finished." It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We should go back, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [Break] All these scientists, they discover so many things. Why they did not discover something that he would not die? He would not become old? Where is that discovery? They will say: "Yes, in future." One man is kicking on your face, and you are saying: "Yes, in future, when I shall become strong, I shall kick him." But you are, my dear sir, being kicked now. What you are doing now? "Yes, I'm getting strength by your kicking." So you all write very strongly, vehemently. Even it is little offensive, still these rascals should be taught good lesson. Yes. They're misleading. Godlessness. As soon as you say "God created", immediately they become arrogant. That is our protest. If they accept God, then we give them all credit. That's all right. Otherwise zero. We don't deprecate their intention of advancement in knowledge. But we simply protest against their defying the authority of God. That is our point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they hear <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> then their hearts will be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. Yesterday, somebody has thanked to our students that: "Oh, we are so obliged to you that you are supplying <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span>" Is it not, somebody has said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes yes. Tripurāri said that. Tripurāri.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh Tripurāri Yes. Somebody said like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Yes, two boys yesterday at the airport, they bought two sets of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Complete?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Six volumes. They held the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> and said: "Thank you very much." And then they put them in their lockers and they were waiting for their plane and they each had the First Canto...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Any sincere man will feel obliged of our, this propaganda movement. "By distributing these books, you are doing a great service to Kṛṣṇa." He wanted to say everyone: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> He comes, therefore. So anyone who is doing the same service, that: "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa," he is recognized by Kṛṣṇa very nicely. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the human society, nobody is dearer than him who is helping preaching work. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We are simply your puppets, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're giving us the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We are all set of puppets of Kṛṣṇa. I am also puppet. Puppet. This is disciplic succession. We, we have to become puppet. That's all. As I am puppet of my Guru Mahārāja, if you become my puppet, then that is success. Our success is there when we become puppet of the predecessor. <span class="Italic">Tāṅdera caraṇa sevi bhakta sane vāsa.</span> To live in the society of devotees and to become puppet of the predecessor <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> This is success. So we are trying to do that. Kṛṣṇa consciousness society and serve the predecessor. That's all. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (pause) People will come. People will appreciate our propaganda. It will take some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are appreciating more now than a couple of years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They're starting to understand the genuine philosophy. (pause) All glories to you Śrīla Prabhupāda. Like some <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now you distribute to all.</div>
