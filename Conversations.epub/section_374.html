<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will understand. Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is proved. We are going to Africa. We are going to Canada, Europe, America. Everyone chants Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is the language. When a young man and young woman loves one another, there is no question of language. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that "Suppose you are in a foreign country. You do not know the language. But when there is fire, you get friends without any language." You see? In the beginning of British rule, there were not very many English-knowing Indians so a clerk in his office was working. So monkey came and he scattered the office papers. So after the monkey was driven away, he was collecting the papers. In the meantime, his English boss came. "What is this, man?" So he could not say. He began to jump. You see. "Monkey, sir. Monkey, sir. (laughter) Monkey, sir." "All right. All right. That's all right." Simply to inform, without any language, you can jump, "Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa." And he will understand. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] (Bengali) Hare Kṛṣṇa and dance. Do this. [break] ...and for constructing four buildings like that. [break] Kṛṣṇa took part in politics. So what is His politics? What is His sociology? What is His culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Support the right minority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Support the right minority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of minority. Support the right person. Kṛṣṇa supported Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira in place of Duryodhana. So formerly it was monarchy. That is perfect politics. This democracy is useless. It has proved. One man, the king, he should be properly educated how to rule, what is the aim of ruling, how the people will be, I mean to say, culturally elevated, what is that culture. [break] There was a consulting board of learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and saintly persons. They would advise the monarch how to rule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This is... This is the land here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yeah, we're walking over it. We're going through... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Elizabeth, in England, she's got a..., what she calls a "think-tank" or a board of advisors who meet and advise her on different policies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Privy council.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Something like that. It's called a "think-tank". She's named it. It's presided over by Lord, Lord Goodman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The thing is, unless the people are Kṛṣṇa conscious, either this board or that board, that will not help. First of all, people should know what is the aim of life, what is culture, how the human activity should be directed. The people should know first of all this. Otherwise, changing from frying pan to the fire, it is useless. That is going on. That change, revolution, is going on. Just like the Russian people, they changed the Czarist government into communist government, revolution, but still, they're unhappy. They're trying to change by another revolution. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> as "chewing the chewed." Or the same simple philosophy: "This side of stool is better than that side." So he keeps the whole thing, stool. "This side, the dry side, is better and the moist side, wet side, is bad." This is no philosophy. It, it must not be stool. It must be gold. Then it is all right, this side or that side. That philosophy, that the dry side of stool is better than the wet side, this will not help. So first, first of all, human society must know what is the aim of life. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are part and parcel of God, Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu. We are suffering on account of our relationship with God. This is the cause of our suffering. Then we have to make plan how to revive our lost relationship with God. Then the... Everything is there in the Vedic literature. All directions are there. So we have to... Just like when we are in danger, we consult some learned man or physician or a lawyer, similarly we have to consult the Vedic culture, how perfect it is. This way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then everything is there. You haven't got to manufacture anything. And the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the gist idea of all Vedic culture. And our propaganda is to establish that gist idea of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So therefore I am asking. "What is the politics of Kṛṣṇa?" Kṛṣṇa's politics was to have a king of the world which..., Kṛṣṇa conscious, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is the Kṛṣṇa's politics. He wanted to replace. So the first politic is to replace these so-called leaders, demons. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Where is that land? This land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> We already walked over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You're talking. So I don't want to interrupt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But on the way ba... It's that land over there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where are... Where are those boys? That Svarūpānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They may have gone back to the temple now. This land... I'm sending... Because land, different land takes different time, so I'm sending both information out for this land here-It goes from this path, this, over to the other side of the barley, right to the river edge, twenty <span class="Italic">bighās-</span>or this one, ten <span class="Italic">bighās,</span> whichever is first. This is more fertile. For agriculture, this one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So which one, like you like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Whichever one is possible. As he says, "First come, first served."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. So you arrange. During stay, arrange something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Something available here also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> This is the old river bed, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...will help us. (Bengali) So you purchase on this side land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This land is for sale with this dhow (?) here. (end)</div>
