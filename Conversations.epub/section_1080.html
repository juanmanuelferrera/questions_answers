<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So explain the situation to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> What happened a couple of times before over here was that some devotees became very passionate, mistreated a few village people here, these laborers. At that time many of the village people, from the villages, they came and they were protesting and they made a big scene about it. One of them was Caraṇāravinda, who created a very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Caraṇāravinda is eccentric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> And then there was Advaitācārya also. So there was very delicate situation because these people... It may be a very little thing, you know, little thing, which does not need much propaganda or anything like that, but the village people made it very big and all the village people came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally they do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They do that. They start... Because they have no other engagement. A little thing to excite them, then they want to become excited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengal it is called <span class="Italic">tilake tāla. Tāla,</span> a palm fruit, it is big, and <span class="Italic">tila,</span> is the sesame. You know sesame seeds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Sesame.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sesame, yes. That is very small. So these seeds, sesame seed, is called <span class="Italic">tila. Tila lava,</span> and they make it <span class="Italic">tāla.</span> Instead of <span class="Italic">tila,</span> it becomes <span class="Italic">tāla,</span> and then big mess. <span class="Italic">Tilake tāla.</span> The fact was <span class="Italic">tila,</span> but they called it <span class="Italic">tāla.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So that was happening. Then the other thing is that these people, they are very innocent people and they are very superstitious also. So when they see foreigners, they immediately become a little afraid. And there is some kind of a complex that comes on them and it makes it very difficult for the foreigners to communicate with these people. This is what I have seen happening. It is very difficult to commu... Now this is what I have experienced since last two, three days also. When Tejas was trying to get this garden around here done, but the laborers could not get the message across. They were doing something else and then the blame was coming on me. I never instructed them at all for doing anything. I never took them away from the work at all. I was amazed and I was surprised to hear that I was accused of taking away the laborers from Tejas and put them on some other work which I had no concern at all. So this is what was troubling me today when I was thinking that "How is it that there was this misunderstanding which has caused anxiety in so many devotees?" So this communication gap is going to be a problem which has to be solved. And for that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this is the explanation of the situation? You...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So how to adjust these things now? Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> What I would suggest, Prabhupāda, is that I could stay here, and whatever work we have to do, we sit together in the morning or in the night and we decide, "Tomorrow we have to do so much. We need so much labor for vegetables. We need so much labor for this, this." We make up a whole schedule of work for the next day. And in the morning laborers come and Tejas, who has experience in agriculture, he can show how this has to be done, how that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he can speak Telegu also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. And I can be there to see that there is proper communication. And then after ten o'clock, because laborers start work early morning, so at ten o'clock, then I can go to Hyderabad and do official work for the day, see the government people and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you think? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is all right. Do it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> We should meet not late in the evening. In the afternoon so that the... If we need more laborers, they have to be informed previously. We can't inform them in the morning. We have to inform them the previous day. In the evening someone has to go to their village or whatever and tell them how many people we need because each day is going to be a little different. As soon as we get the water, we're going to need many, many laborers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. That's how it would be, if we could get permanent laborers. That's another thing I experienced, that when these village laborers come, they come at nine o'clock, nine-thirty, they work at their own speed and then, at five-thirty, they see the sun. I was amazed how they find the exact time but they do it by the sun's movements. Exactly at five-thirty they will stop their work and go. But I have seen our laborers who stay here on our land, they work from five-thirty in the morning and they work all day, all the way to the night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> There are some people here from the local village. They are working also nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> I think that Ānandamaya, he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is good idea. In the evening you sit together, make program and execute it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> In the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There's one more point that Tejas made. That's about the outside workers, he was saying, from Kerala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> We should also be careful because, about enmity also. Because I've lived in the villagers' houses for two years and I've seen in different cases where if an outsider is there, these Kerala people, they are also considered outsiders, these villagers, they regard them as being different. So they are actually even getting more requisites than the local people. We should try and encourage the local people in working. They may not in the beginning work so hard, but we should encourage them that this is their project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Local people will always be working because we will never have a staff to be enough for all our work. Like, we may have twenty, thirty families staying here, and I have seen that the people who are staying in these villages, they will not come and stay over here because they are staying just around here. They have their own house. They will come and work here, they will participate and everything but they won't come and stay here. They have their houses outside here. But the people from different villages, a little away, who have no home, who are helpless, they will come and stay and they will be very loyal. If we give them food and we give them clothing they will be very loyal to us. They will become like our full supporters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Naturally. Naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> There is two men here who are like that because they have no home. They were staying on the street and they were working on the construction. So I said, "Come here." And then we gave them food...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> That Mobhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Mebubshah. He's a Muslim but he's so loyal. He's the best man. And then Puru and Hanumān. These three people, they are very loyal and they are trustworthy. These people in the villages, they tend... Because they have their home there, so sometimes they want something for their home, so they will steal. And if some other village man steals, he will not stop them. He will say, "All right," because if he stops him, then in his village there will be trouble for him. See? So he will encourage his other villagers to steal. But these men, if they see some villagers stealing, they will stop them. This has happened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is natural. So how to deal with this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So we have both. We can get outsiders to come and stay here who we can give <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> make them chant, and give them <span class="Italic">mahā-prasādam.</span> They love it. In the morning. We used to give them a little <span class="Italic">mahā-prasādam</span> in the morning. They like it very much. By that, we gain their confidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We shall like that they will come here and stay and remain our twenty-four hours' son. That is very good also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Only thing is that in the beginning, because they do not know us very well, they will demand some salary. I told you previously that now I am paying them hundred rupees and 125 rupees for family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why 125? Hundred rupees sufficient. If they are eating and we are giving shelter, then a hundred rupees sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Hundred rupees... If they have a family, then his wife works also and his children who are grown up, they all work. Everyone works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they'll also work. So that you have to decide. Manage so that there is no misunderstanding. Simply management required. So you... The best thing is that you should sit together...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Without fail we have to meet every evening. There shouldn't be any... Without fail every evening we should meet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That will be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> There shouldn't be many interruptions. Otherwise then it becomes a botheration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> One question I have, Prabhupāda. Yesterday, day before yesterday, we were discussing the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if they bring one nice cook...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, well, this evening I was just over there, and I noticed some of the carpenters are cooking and I don't know who the other people are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They're not cooking for the feast. They're cooking their own thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, no, no. They were cutting up our vegetables which are going to be cooked and served to the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, right over there by the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No uninitiated person should cook. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> What about professional cooks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Professional cooks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Profes...? They are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, but they... Even though they are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they have this habit of smoking, and if we try to find a professional cook who doesn't smoke, it is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. As far as possible, our men should cook, a professional man who is in good habit, who has promised that they will not do this smoking. We have to manage somehow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> As far as our devotees' cooking, it's practically impossible. We have tried so hard. They just can't do it. Yesterday two of the boys tried to help, and the rice was not cooked because it was not done and he burned his leg. The water fell on his leg, and he couldn't handle the pots properly and he got... Now the poor boy, he is suffering. He's got a wounded leg, one of the German boys, the one with long hair. So our devotees, they are not... This boy, Bengali boy, Divid (?), he's good. He can do it but he needs at least four or five men to help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> He was a professional cook but he's not... He can't do it himself. He needs too much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He needs at least four people to help. It's a big cooking, so it's also very difficult for one man to do and nobody wants to help the cooking because it's so hot, the smoke goes in the eyes and it's very troublesome. So nobody wants to help in the cooking, devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not willing. They are not willing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They're not willing to help in the kitchen because it is very hot, very hard, the eyes get burned, things like that. So this one Bengali boy, he's a very good cook. He can do it very nicely but he wants help. And if no one helps, then he refuses to cook. And if you press him, then he runs away. Yesterday he tried to run away four times because we were trying to press him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, cooking alone, it is not possible. So that you have to do. Find out some men. Cooperate. Otherwise how it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, therefore I'm asking you about hired people, whether hired people are good. In my experience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if they are, if our men not available, then you must hire, hire people. But not these carpenters or like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No, we should get professional cooks who are really good, like this man who cooked today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this man is coming. He can bring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, he himself will come. But he will have the habit of smoking and I think we can at the most regulate his smoking. "If you want to smoke, you go somewhere far away and smoke and before you start cooking you must wash yourself, have a bath, and then do the cooking."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What can be done? <span class="Italic">Ne māmā che kānā māmā</span> (?) "If there is no uncle, one blind uncle is all right." So the matter is now clear. You do it and develop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There is one confusion in my mind, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Mahāṁśa said that the local villagers will not be inclined to come here and live because they are living just outside. But my impression was, from hearing you speak was, that everyone, whether they're living just outside or a long distance outside, they are suffering from material existence. They're having to struggle for existence. They're being taxed by the government. There's so many problems to maintain themself. And every living being in the material world is struggling to maintain himself. But if we offer them a house here and some work and we give them all food, clothing, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's our aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our aim. So you can engage some men to cut the hill for blocks and gradually develop house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> These Badapur (?), they are good men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like this room, yes. And as far as possible, induce them to come and live here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. Yes, that can be done. But family attachment... You see, these people, they have also family attachment, just like <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> So they are not so willing to... Because their whole family... The whole village is like one family. It's like one family. They are all related to each other. And they can stay. They stay. Many of them stay here overnight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally everyone wants to stay at his own place. "Home sweet home." "There is no place like home." That's a fact. That is psychology. They will like to stay there. But if they have got facility to live here with family they may come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I was thinking we can make their house just like our house. If they are living right on our border, we can go to their house, tell them how to make an altar and make them live like how we are living. Let them stay there but let them live a good Kṛṣṇa conscious life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll come gradually, not immediately. Immediately, the psychology is, they have got attachment for their house. It may be worse house, but still, their attachment... That is natural. Long, long ago, when I was child practically, I went with my father in the village. So one man from the village was serving us. So my father: "This boy is nice. So why not take him to Calcutta?" So one day he was absent. It was dropping and... So I went in the interior of the village and I saw that his house was broken, there was no roof, and rain was falling and he was sitting, covering with a cloth. Then I told him that "Why not come with us in Calcutta? We shall give you nice place, nice food." So his answer was, <span class="Italic">nā bābu kanceri jabo nā</span> (?): "Bābujī, I cannot go out of my home." That was his home. (laughter) This is my practical exp... He was sitting idly and it dropping and he could not come to serve. Still, that is his home, and he cannot leave home, that "<span class="Italic">Bābu kanceri jabo nā</span> (?). That is psychology. It may be very worse condition; still, nobody wants to give up "home sweet home." That is natural psychology. So you have to manage. You see then why they, these Delhi passenger clerks... This morning I was telling that son was asking mother, "Who is this man?" His father, and he had never seen. "You have seen father." No, rather, he had no chance to see father because when the father comes back from the office it is night, ten o'clock or more than that. That time the son is sleeping, and again he has to go early in the morning. That time also, son is sleeping. So he did not know. So one Sunday, when he's grown up, he is asking his mother, "Who is this man?" "So this man..." Not only in India, in everywhere. I have seen in New York from the other island? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Long Island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Long Island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Long Island. They are coming two hours in the ferry, three hours in the bus. They are going to the office. Eight hours there. Then five hours and eight hours, thirteen hours, again five hours. Then thirteen and..., eighteen hours. And for six hours they have got home. "Home sweet home."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I knew people coming from Poona to Bombay to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> All the way from Poona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The home attachment is so great. These Delhi passengers, they are coming, hanging, and there are so many accidents daily. And few hours he will live with wife. That is his home. And whole other, out of twenty-four hours, seventeen hours are outside, and maybe seven hours at home. But still, he'll come home. The home attachment is very big. Therefore we have to create attachment for this <span class="Italic">hari-saṅkīrtana.</span> If you create that attachment, then they will give up home attachment, try life, to live here. <span class="Italic">Athāsaktiḥ.</span> You have to train them in Kṛṣṇa consciousness in such a way. Then</div>
<div class="Verse">ādau śraddhā tataḥ sādhu-<br class="calibre2"/>saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā<br class="calibre2"/>tato 'nartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt<br class="calibre2"/>tato niṣṭhā rucis tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Cc. Madhya 23.14-15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Āsakti. Then they will be attached here. Spiritually if you enlighten them, then they'll be attached. They'll voluntarily say they are accepting here. The chanting, chanting, then... This is the beginning, that "You chant and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" Then <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Gradually the heart will be cleansed, and gradually they will be elevated to the platform of <span class="Italic">āsakti.</span> Then they will not want money, they will not want... Then they will live here, work, just you are doing. That stage, that requires little advancement. Therefore I say this <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> program must be continued. Then <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</span> As you make the heart cleansed, they become more and more advanced. And then this stage of <span class="Italic">āsakti,</span> that "This is... We shall live here." Just like we have given up our hearth and home and wife and children. We have given up that attachment. This attachment, practical... That is... You cannot expect immediately. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one gets better attachment, then they can give up this nasty attachment. Therefore we have to continue this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> This is the psychology. But there is very great prospect to develop this place, and you have got experience. If you can develop, it will be very nice example. Once successful here, we can introduce this program. And India will be easier because they are by nature inclined to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It will be easier. The <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> must be there. Otherwise why we have to take so much responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Last night it was very hard. Again no one was coming to the <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> These persons who are staying here in the garb of devotees, if they don't come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> No one would come. It was a great struggle. Again Jagadīśa and I and Mūrti, we were alone there and we had to go and get people and again they wouldn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> This Kṛṣṇan wouldn't come, and this other never comes. They should be made to leave. Otherwise they must follow the program. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> is so nice. All day we may be doing something. The only relief we get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, without <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Refreshes you completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you stop <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> then it is ordinary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> And these people are very enthusiastic for <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our men should be, those who are here, they must be very enthusiastic. And the <span class="Italic">pandal,</span> what is this play <span class="Italic">pandal?</span> This <span class="Italic">pandal?</span> It is very small.
