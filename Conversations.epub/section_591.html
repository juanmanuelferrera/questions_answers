<div class="Heading">Morning Walks<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 18-19, 1975, Honolulu</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Morning walk, June 18th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...their own food, it takes working eight hours for three months. So three months, if they work hard-hard means eight hours, not more than-then the whole year's provision is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. Simply they have to harvest, time, maybe two hours a day. Farming or being in the countryside also seems to be, in itself working in the countryside rather than in a factory, seems to be more conducive for thinking, even while they're working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is a fact. This factory working is most demonic. It is not required at all. For the interest of a few persons this device has been invented. Therefore the Communist movement is there. And the China has found the Communistic movement in Russia is defective because although it is Communistic, the whole idea of exploitation by the powerful is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, that is their argument actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And that is the fact. And Chinese Communism will be perfect if they take little instruction from us. We are also Communist, Kṛṣṇa Communist. We want that everyone should be happy. The Communistic philosophy is also like that. They want to see everyone happy. But they have made a materialistic center. That will not help. People are attracted to these bad habits of materialistic civilization. The most important is that sex and intoxication and meat-eating and gambling. So their attraction has to be changed. Otherwise, although these Chinese, they are pushing in the village, that village also will be a brothel. They must have some attraction. So where is that attraction? Just like the hippies. They do not like this civilization, but the attraction for the sex and intoxication they could not give up. So they remain the nasty again in a different way. The process should be <span class="Italic">mayy āsakta-manaḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span> That attraction. <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta.</span> "The attraction which you..., should be changed to Me." This yoga should be practiced. Then it will be all right. The same example: if you keep the dogs as dog, there is no possibility of making a peaceful dog society. That is not possible. You have to change their doggish quality. Then there will be peace. How you can expect peaceful society amongst the dogs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Actually the Chinese are attempting artificially to keep the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not know that where is the defect. Defect is that everyone has got some attraction. Somebody has attraction for his personal self. Somebody has got attraction for wife, children, family, then attraction for society. In this way they talk of many things. They have come to attraction of humanity. They are all nonsense. The attraction is for sense gratification under different names only. My attraction for family is not for their benefit. By my sense gratification the family members help me, therefore I am attracted. The wife gives me pleasure; therefore I like wife. The wife also likes husband because husband gives pleasure. Otherwise, there is no attraction. As soon as the husband and wife fails to give pleasure, divorce. The son goes out. The daughter goes out. So everyone is prone to some attraction. So if you keep them in the material attraction, then you can change the name; the disease will continue. That is the difficulty. You can change the name from this ism to that ism but every ism is material. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti.</span> That is also... "The <span class="Italic">mūḍhā,</span> these rascal, they do not know <span class="Italic">mām,</span> Me, Kṛṣṇa," <span class="Italic">param avyayam,</span> "inexhaustible pleasure." Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of all pleasure. In the Vṛndāvana there is sporting. There is association with young girls, father, mother. Everything is exactly like this. And in any circumstance they are happy. It is not that in Vṛndāvana Kṛṣṇa is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He cannot see the face of woman. It is not like that. (chuckles) But because it is spiritual, it is all-attractive. There are also the trees, animals, the river, the fruits, the flowers, the father, the mother, the beloved girls, beloved boys, sporting among the cowherd boys, going to the forest, the cows and calves, everything. So that attraction is required. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they are thinking, "Again attraction like this? So make it zero, no attraction. Become zero." So their philosophy is zero philosophy. That is also no information of the spiritual world, Buddha philosophy and Māyāvāda philosophy, <span class="Italic">śūnyavādī, nirviśeṣa,</span> without varieties or zero. Without varieties means zero. So two philosophers. But therefore they invent: "Anything is all right." They invent. After all, they want zeroism. [break] <span class="Italic">...pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ.</span> [break] ...one increases the attraction for Kṛṣṇa, they will never be happy. [break] ...simply changing attraction on the material platform under different names. That will be failure. [break] Dr. Wolfe is missing that evolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Dr. Wolfe? Is he missing the evolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was speaking biological?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, I think he was not understanding it so well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means his understanding, that biological, not ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, he's thinking biological evolution instead of transmigration of the soul. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ.</span> Anything evolving on the bodily concept of life, he remains an animal. That is the defect of the western philosophy. [break] ...philosophy, the dog's tail. He is always this way, material way. [break]</div>
<div class="Verse">(yasyātma) <span class="Italic">buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke<br class="calibre2"/>sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-idya-dhīḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij<br class="calibre2"/>janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB </span>10.84.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Go</span> means cow; <span class="Italic">kharaḥ</span> means ass. [break] ...also nowadays it has become a fashion to keep dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, and to put stool on the sidewalk. Wherever there is dogs, there is stool all over the sidewalk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the modern civilization. They are avoiding cow dung and associating dog stool. (laughs) This is modern... Cow dung is so beneficial. That they are avoiding. And they are associating dog stool. The dog mentality. The master and the servant, and the, er, dog, both of them watching. The master writes by signboard. What is that? "Keep away. Private property." And the animal also making, "Gow! Gow! Gow!" Both of them are dogs. He is making "Gow! Gow!" by signboard, and he is doing it as nature, but both of them are dogs. One is two-legged dog, another is four-legged dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Man keeps dog as an extension of his doggish mentality, as an extension of himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The dog... Sometimes the dog and the person, they look the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They look alike. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> It's often seen that an owner of a dog looks just like that particular dog. They look very much alike, and they have similar personalities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's a fact because the subtle body is doggish and he is going to be a dog next life. <span class="Italic">Tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ</span>. Because he is always thinking of his dog, always, therefore he is going to be a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> By association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Saṅgāt sañjayate kāmaḥ.</span> The desire becomes according to association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Everybody that's walked by today has had a dog. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, why you are laughing? [break] ...two without association of dog. They have developed that consciousness, dog consciousness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> ...thinking when the dog has to pass stool 'cause then they have to take him outside. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...the statistics, how many dogs are there in the United States?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, there are. There are more dogs than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Than human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I think there might be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There are many millions, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Maybe dogs and cats combined. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The people, they feed their dog and cat so much food that millions of human beings could be fed from the food. Because so much grains are required... They feed them meat, but so much grains are required to produce that food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> More money is spent on food for dogs in the United States than for babies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. [break] In the recent food crisis in the United States, 18% of the people started eating dog food because there's so much... They use such high quality beef and based on so many grains and everything. And they use grains themselves. Milk products. [break] They're even learning how to eat dog food. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...dogs in the beach, you cannot walk without seeing dog. More footprints of the dogs than human being. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> ...actually give dogs more rights also, in a sense. For instance, if you... [break] ...and a human being, every time you walked, if there was a human being yelling at everyone who walked by and was going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! You get away! Get away! Get away!" then soon the man would be arrested for being a nuisance or a threat to people. But a dog is allowed to do that. He can stay there and yell and yell at everybody... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car:) ...and Russian, they are different country. Chinese, Oriental; Russian, Occidental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. Like all Occidental countries or at least in the United States, there is the philosophy that, if you have sex, that your sexual energy will not be lost. In other words, their feeling is that one doesn't lose his health or strength from having too much sex or from using his sexual energy, whereas the Chinese, they are very... Everyone in the society for centuries and centuries have accepted that even for physical strength and, mental strength it's very important not to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indulge in sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> ...indulge in sex so that it's just a cultural thing that they actually try to control that just for health and mental power, whereas in the west the leaders and the people in general... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and because they indulge too much in sex, therefore they cannot understand. That is the proof they are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. [break] ...control themselves. The colonialists will go in and... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless they are taught about spiritual attraction, everyone will be finished. [break] ...very childhood they should be given spiritual education. [break] ...by repressive method you will never be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. Repression is also due to frustration. That they can't convince someone... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Russians are doing that by repression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. Then whenever their back is turned the people do something else. Or they will stab them in the... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do that? [break] Leaders?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. [break] Yes. So the only way that they can attract them is to just let them free in the school. But I said that... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen in the Hawaii University, all hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. In Hawaii it's very loose. For instance, even the high schools, they're mostly very loose. But when, after it gets too loose, then the students go so much into sense gratification that then there becomes... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...solution, they will not take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, because it would mean they would have... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> He speaks straight from his heart so you can... [break] ...that Yogi Bhajan's philosophy though. He wants everybody to come to the... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is responsible for the mistake of the followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes. So now he must have many leaflets printed up with this information about the prime minister's guru. But now it's out of date. It will be out of date. He will have to print new thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was distributing leaflet like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, literature inviting people, you know, about the conference. [break] Is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita widely available in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not very important thing. It has nothing to do with spiritual..., but moral instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> For <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, for everyone. You can get from India, Canakya Paṇḍita. It is called <span class="Italic">Cāṇakya-śloka,</span> "Verses composed by Canakya," <span class="Italic">Cāṇakya-śloka.</span> [break] ...western country, they have come to a stage in which by nature they are now seeking after some spiritual importance. And that is available in India. But these rascals, they are taking advantage of it and exploiting, this Guru Mahārāja, these yogis, these... But these people, western people, they are searching after this. So it is our duty especially to give them the right thing. They are searching after, and they are taking advantage of it and exploiting them. [break] ...is one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Yes, that's why they're not allowed in the United States. They're not accepted as... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has gone to India. [break] Yogic <span class="Italic">āsana</span> exercise is very popular. They think it is spiritual, exercising the body. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> This way is longer. You have more room to keep walking. That way you have to stop after awhile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...them something substantial. They are eager. This is the proper time. By nature the turn comes.

Go on with it. [break] Tomorrow we shall come for morning walk? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manasvī:</span> You'll have to leave the temple about 8:00, before eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> 7:30</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> There's time. There's time to take a walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You would have to take massage in the morning, so I don't there would be ample time.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> For breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">...khalu sarvataḥ syāt. Viṣaya</span> means sense enjoyment. Now, that boy and the girl, they're taking dogs. The dog is also male and female, and the man is male and female. So <span class="Italic">viṣaya</span> means sense enjoyment. The sex enjoyment is both; the dogs and the man, they will have. But the man can get Kṛṣṇa; the dog cannot get Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference. <span class="Italic">Viṣaya,</span> that sex enjoyment, is available both for the dogs and the man. But the man can achieve Kṛṣṇa; the dog cannot. That is special. <span class="Italic">Viṣaya khalu sarvataḥ syāt.</span> [break] ...of eating, sleeping, mating. That is available in every life. [break] ...another passage is there in <span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta, janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya:</span> "In every life, one can get father and mother." <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhajahun re bhāi</span>(?): "But Kṛṣṇa and guru cannot be had in every life." That is only in human life. Otherwise, as soon as there is birth, there is father and mother. Either you become human being or tiger or snake or bird, the father mother is there. But the spiritual father and Kṛṣṇa, that can be obtained in human life, not in every life.</div>
<div class="Verse">janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhajahun re bhāi.(?)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So we should take full advantage of the human life. That is civilization. And in sense gratification it is not civilization; it is animal life.

And as soon as you perform <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> the police will harass you. This is civilization. [break] ...nice place, there should be so many temples. People will come early in the morning, take bath in the sea, go to the temple, have some spiritual inspiration. That program is there. And running. The dog is running and the man is running. [break] This sense does not come that "The dog is running; I am also running. Where is the difference between him and me? She has got a female mate; I have got a female mate. Where is the difference? How I am civilized?" That, this sense, does not come. [break] ...thinking, "I have chained the dog, but I am not chained." But you are chained by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> invisible chain.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> From observation and experience, I think that there's a higher rate of sickness in the temples than outside the temples, than the normal population for some reason, and I was wondering what could be done to bring this down. Like I know every time I'm living in close quarters, for instance, here in the temple I get some type of flu. And I can think of what it might be, but I think that in many of the temples, from what I've experienced, there seems to be more sickness. I don't know whether it's...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manasvī is not sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manasvī:</span> No, there is not anything like flu or anything. Some of the devotees have like chronic diseases.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manasvī:</span> I have rheumatism, you know. That is from the beginning. Some people are like that. Honolulu temple is not so sick. Once it happened about three months before. At that time I was told it was all over happening. But no, generally Honolulu temple, there is not much sickness. (end)</div>
