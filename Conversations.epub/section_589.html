<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, we have jackfruit. Big fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They do not know how to eat it mostly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bring. I shall show you. (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> I have seen them selling sometime in private market, but I don't know if we can get it in the public market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I've never seen it in a public market.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They do... [break] ...sell it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can have some jackfruit tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> On the land, on the property. Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. [break] ...nutritive and very sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Very sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. When it is ripe, it is very sweet. And when it is not ripe, it is called "vegetable meat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "Tree goat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...prepare, it is better than meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...the seeds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, big, big seeds. That is also very digestive. If you make it powder, it acts like, what is called, pancreas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> I think you once told a story about an Englishman who wanted to taste jackfruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...tree, jam. It is berry, but blue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They call it java plum. It's a very... It's bitter fruit? Is it very bitter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not bitter. It is sour, little sour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They makes a blue stain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Many here, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very good. That is very good for diabetic patient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Should we plant one on the land too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break] It is called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Kalajam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kalajam,</span> yes. [break]... is good medicine for diabetes. [break] ...houses are all fire-proof, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's what they say, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> No, they're not fire-proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are concrete. There is no frame work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span>. There is no wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Then how is it they had a fire in one? They had a fire in one recently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Sometimes a fire starts in the kitchen or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kitchen, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Because there's gas. And the furniture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in the house. Wooden houses, they are just like match box. [break] ...Australia, they like cottage house. They don't like this skyscraper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yeah, they like brick house, many brick houses, spread out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Small, one storied. They are aristocratic. They do not go to the skyscraper, common man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They like the idea of one house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good idea. That is Indian idea. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...front of the hedges, all those hedges in the front? They produce this flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice. Very good. <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span> As soon as such fragrance, one should remember Kṛṣṇa: "This is Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Puṇyo gandhaḥ pṛthivyāṁ ca.</span> [break] Where is that scientist? Just like from the earth we are getting so many varieties of flavor and taste. The fruits are different taste, the flowers different fragrance, but wherefrom it is coming? From the earth. So why the scientists do not take all these things from the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> All they do is create smog. Kṛṣṇa creates fragrant flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, smog is also created by Kṛṣṇa. That's all right. I mean to say in the ground everything is there, the flavor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> So why they can't put it together?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why they cannot, by scientific, chemical or physical way, they cannot take the flavor from the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They do make synthetic scents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They come out synthetic, though, they do not smell the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Not as good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Actually they make perfumes from flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Flowers, yes. That is... But not you take some dirt and extract the flavor. Then I will know that you are scientist. (laughter) [break] ...the vast water, but they cannot make it sweet. That you will have to depend on God. The water is, actually is taken, and it is made sweet. So how they can deny the hand of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have some water distillation plants now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. He may distill one pound of water. That does not mean that... Why they are unnecessarily proud and denying the authority of God? How foolish they are. Therefore I don't like them, the most heinous type of atheist, not gentlemen. [break] Whenever they hold some conference they say, "Don't talk of God. Then you cannot come to the conference." Do they not? What is that principle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, yes, they do that. There was a conference on biology and evolution, and they made a rule at the beginning of the conference that "Whatever we discuss from now on is all right except that we will not discuss about God or anything, any divine factor of creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how much atheist they are. Shameless atheist. Other atheists, they have got some shame. But these people are shameless. Shameless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> "Because we cannot see God in our laboratory, therefore we will not discuss Him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why do you teach us? We do not see whatever you say. We do not, so why do you place upon us? If seeing is evidence, then we don't see what nonsense you are talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> We don't see their atoms. We don't see their sputniks flying and landing or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They want to put themselves in the place of the supreme authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that's all right. If that is your reason, that you don't see God, but we don't see that you are going to the moon planet. Why you make us believe that you are going to moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They might also say that we don't have the eyes to see the atoms and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then you take our formula. Why do you expect to see God with your eyes? That means they are shameless atheist. Other atheists, they have got little shame, but these people have no shame even.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They roam about freely. It's over there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jīvārthau mudā... Rādhā-kṛṣṇam ahar-niśam...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...problem is, at the present moment, they have exhausted all their intellect. Now they are finding out how to bluff the people and maintain themselves. That is their problem. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. The people have lost faith in the science because they have not produced anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the problem. Because they have cheated people for so many years and drawn high salaries, now they are finding out: "How to cheat these rascals and continue our business?" This is the problem. Because they have nothing to research. Everything, whatever, are finished. And all failure. Simply big, big words, that's all. Word jugglery, that's all. They could not do anything. What exactly they have done, something which is not done by God? They competition with God, so what they have done? What is their contribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Only negative; nothing positive. [break] ...easier to kill people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That much they have done, yes. [break] ...diverting the attention of the people from going to the moon planet, they are meeting in the sky. So what will benefit we shall derive by their meeting in the sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> They have scientists now that are proposing and they have grants on how to develop a city in outer space or on the moon. They already have it how they're going to send people, how they're going to get their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is another bluff. You see? And these rascals are believing them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> Especially they're making, trying to make people feel that their problems will be solved, that when it gets too bad they'll just be able to go to the moon. So there's no real problem even if you ruin the earth because you can always escape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that mean... What about their moon planet going? That is stopped?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> I don't think they're sending any more rockets to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, they're finished now. There's too much litter up there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> [break] ...a campaign that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will take place. Otherwise, how they will be killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They're calling it a limited nuclear war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are accumulated so much sinful load that must be killed. That is sure. [break] ...the massacre. That will take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The sinless people will survive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We. [break] There was an artificial famine in India and I particularly inquired from all devotees whether they have got any problem in this famine. They said, "No, we haven't got." I have taken the statistics. In 1942 the artificial famine created by government... So there were big earthquake in Bihar. At that time one of my godbrother, he was government auditor. So I inquired. In that earthquake only his house was saved. I have seen it many times. <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the only....</div>

<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām.</span> It is not meant for them, all these dangerous condition. Now the nuclear war means it will not continue very long. The first party who will drop the bomb on the other party, he will be victorious, and immediately the war will stop. They are simply arranging how to drop the atom bomb first. So one who will be able to drop the bomb first, he will be victorious. It doesn't require long time. Just like in Japan, as soon as the Americans dropped the atom bomb in Hiroshima, immediately they surrendered. This will be the result. Now the question is who will be able to drop the bomb first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpa:</span> The Japanese didn't have any atom bombs to send back, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It was in possession of Hitler. And your American stolen and kept it. Hitler wanted to use it, but, good sense, he did not like. He said that "I can do it immediately, but I will not do it." So three bombs they kept ready, and when Germany was in awkward condition these Americans, they stolen, and they used it in Japan. This was manufactured by the German.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Most of the American scientific knowledge for going to space, etc., is all gotten from the Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They stole the German scientists. And the Russians also, after the war, they took many German scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think the aeroplane was made by the Germans first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, the jet airplane, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they took it, the idea, from Sanskrit literature. Yes. They purchased the book from Benares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In India we have, and Hawaii, the firecrackers going up, the idea was from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The Germans also had the idea that this universe is encaged in some hard layers. And they were trying to bounce waves off of the edge of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Germans, they very much praised Indian culture. That my godbrother Soulier, when he came to India he said that "When Indian students come to our country, first of all we inquire how much he has got asset of his own culture. If we find that he has got some knowledge in his own culture, then we receive. Otherwise we reject." As soon as they found that somebody is made of London culture, then immediately they reject. There are many Sanskrit scholars in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> All of the good dictionaries are from Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Max Mueller was German.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A lot of the devotees have been wondering about book production if there is some war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> War? The war will be for a few days only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Then the presses can go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This war will not prolong. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this is not the big one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is big war, but it will be finished within short time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Drop their bombs, everything's finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> But the argument is that these bombs will create more disturbance than just the blowing up. They create what's called radio-active fallout.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that will do. But the war will stop because the party which will be able to drop the bomb first, he will be victorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They've got these fancy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then after effects, what will happen, that is another thing. But the war will not continue for ten years or five years, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Many Communist countries now, they are not making any more big cities. They are keeping the population very spread out so that after the war they will be able to take over. Because if one has a big city, then the people can be killed very easily in one bomb, finished.
