<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She had a very religious background.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women are generally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They're more religious, yes. My children... My son does not eat, I told you the other day, even tomatoes. He's going to States for a fellowship, and I don't know what he'll do there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you don't like to eat tomato, who is going to force? That is not... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Hindu, that is wrong nomenclature. There is no Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> It is a..., Hindu is a way of life. Even Muslims live the same way, even Christians live the same way. The <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is the real word. Just use it and then everyone says. I heard it in a letter to American consul about this matter. In there I mentioned <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> I have said <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> not Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> I have mentioned like that. Real (indistinct) is the Vedic religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the religion actually means the law given by God. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Religion is not manufactured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> has said, <span class="Italic">dharmāgnira sadācāra śruti smṛti (?)(indistinct).</span> What is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śruti</span> and <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> that is <span class="Italic">dharma. Sadācāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Basic principle is that it is made by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now there are books, how to carry out the order. And the ultimate understanding, how to become faithful to the (indistinct). Just like good citizen means faithful to the government. Unfortunately these rascals, they do not have any idea, the supreme controller, supreme government. They say anything automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vaiṣṇava is a good citizen of the government of God. That is Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And Kṛṣṇa teaches that <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Who will surrender unless he's a Vaiṣṇava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This morning you would like to take your breakfast after the program or after resting? Because I do not want to prepare the <span class="Italic">idli...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Later. All other <span class="Italic">dharmas</span> are cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān</span> means all other vocations, I would say. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means whatever vocation... Is one of the interpretations. "All vocations you leave and come to Me only and be My <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span>" That is... I would... <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is great. We are small. The small business is to serve the great. That is going on everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> means "You do work according to My dictate. That is My <span class="Italic">śaraṇam.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">śaraṇam,</span> not that you remain independent from <span class="Italic">śaraṇam.</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means you obey the infallible laws of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.</span> This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are thinking of psychological, sir. If you think of a particular thing, then you become merge in that. Practically your mind becomes so... That is how the researches are carried out by (indistinct). You become mad on that. You become mad on Kṛṣṇa. You get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is natural to serve God, to remain faithful to Him. This is natural. Artificially you are trying to be independent. This is the Māyāvāda... Still, they are trying to become God himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, after first I met you, some previous time, I made an extensive study of both the sides of Vaiṣṇavism as well as the (indistinct). I think they are falling short of the final (indistinct). Once they say that they are in Brahman, but there is Parabrahman also. That Brahman is nothing but a <span class="Italic">jyoti</span> of Parabrahman. That they forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And I think, sir, even Śaṅkarācārya has not meant that we must be short of that. He was also worshiping, was he not? He was worshiping Parabrahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has given a commentary on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In the beginning he says <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ,</span> "Nārāyaṇa is transcendental."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But these fellows are misinterpreting later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole world is full of demons. And they are demons. Who declare himself, "I am God," he's a demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Only one who has actually realized Parabrahman and the, become the real (indistinct) of Brahman, he has got a right to say Brahma... Unless he becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20].</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> Then he becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta.</span> Otherwise he cannot become. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūta</span> is the first stage. This they consider the final. I mean, that is my understanding. I don't know, I may be right or wrong. But I want to be corrected by you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūta... Jīva-bhūta,</span> everyone is thinking, "I am this body." That is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūta.</span> And when understands that "I'm not body, I'm within the body," that is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is <span class="Italic">ādya.</span> Perpetually Brahman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the beginning of spiritual knowledge. Therefore Kṛṣṇa begins from this point. "Why you are thinking that you are one of the family members? This is bodily concept."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Nobody is your relative, but the soul can never die. This is the body. Body has no value. Lot of mosquitoes, you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mosquito? Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I'm not covered (indistinct) my legs. There's a lot of mosquitoes in here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If there's biting, (laughs) here you don't get malaria but you get elephantitis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe elephantitis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because the elephantitis, that's very common in the (indistinct). The mosquitoes are infected by elephantitis and they infect you. These mosquitoes are (indistinct) ...carry malaria carry this elephantitis. All these villages on the coastline, right from Ratnagiri up to Dvārakā, whole coast is infected by elephantitis. Everywhere you go you see big, big leg. In fact it is right from Bhuvaneśvara. On Bhuvaneśvara sea water these mosquitoes breed even in (indistinct). I made a special study of malaria, so I have studied all the types of mosquito, and that particular mosquito on that coast is called (indistinct). Because they came right from Sundar Island. (swamps)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sundar island, Sundarban, Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sundarban has gone in Pakistan side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still in West Bengal. Sundarban is near Calcutta, about fifty miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All water-logged country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are big, big tigers, big, big snakes. That Bengal tiger is famous. That tiger, his tail sometimes ten feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bengal tigers are very ferocious. They are all man-eaters. Here in Gujarat, lions are only in Gujarat in India. Those lions walk about like dogs in the jungle. They don't attack any human being. Whole of India only that is the place where lions are found.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big lions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Big lion. They have counted, there are not more than 300 lions now in the jungle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? They were killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is in, just near (indistinct), that big jungle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Central India also there are lions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There are no lions anywhere, sir. Lions only in Africa and India in this place. Not even South America, anywhere. This Gujarat, this particular jungle, and Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Africa they have hunted down all the lions on safari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killing business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have killed them at random. There is a disease called sleeping sickness. This sleeping sickness is common in the wild game and wild animals and antelopes in Africa. That we found out. And from there a type of fly called tsetse fly, he bites them. Just like the flies bite those animals, then when you go in the jungle they bite you. When they bite you they transfer the germ from animal to you, and you get the sleeping sickness. Now the latest sleeping sickness medicine is dependable, I mean nobody can die. But to arrest this disease in Central Africa, they'll kill all the game. Still they have not been able to arrest this sleeping sickness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is only theory; therefore I don't believe that. Simply theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It's more common in the Congo, in northern Rhodesia, part of Rhodesia and Uganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they pour water... (end)</div>
