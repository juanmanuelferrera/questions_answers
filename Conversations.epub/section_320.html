<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody who was atheist, talk with Kīrtanānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Hṛdayānanda Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you were atheist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your view of atheist? What is your argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I don't know. I couldn't think of any good argument. They say that... No, it's not a good argument, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's all one, isn't it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Kīrtanānanda, his argument was, when he was an atheist, he said that actually the void is truth, and all categories or all varieties are illusion. So he said that we may think that actually spiritual variegatedness is transcendental, but that's actually also our illusion. That was his argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what did you reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I replied that if categories are illusion, then his talking is also illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So I wouldn't let him say anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, very good reply. "And you are also illusioned. Whatever nonsense you are talking, that is also illusion. Finish. Void, everything." Then what did he reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said... I just wouldn't let him say anything. Whenever he tried to talk, I just said, "That's illusion." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This reply we give to the Māyāvādīs. So we speak to the Māyāvādī guru, that "Whether you are in <span class="Italic">māyā?</span> Because everything is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> so whether you are also in <span class="Italic">māyā?</span>" So if he says, "Yes," then how he can become guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Professor Bharati said that. And when the students asked him, "Isn't everything in this world illusion?", he said, "Yes, everything is illusion, but I like it very much."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He likes it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That's what he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he is a rascal. That proves that he is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> After that debate, many, many people have bought <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then it is good triumph. Yes. (begins chanting <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...ponds like this, we remember immediately Bengal. Yes. In Bengal there are many, many ponds. (pause) What is called, this playing? What is this? Golf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Golf course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are coming for playing golfs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes, as soon as it's light, they'll be playing. They work hard all week so that they can play golf on Sunday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They think that a gentleman should play golf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the fashion of the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> A man is considered very rich if he can play golf every day. The rich men play every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very expensive, golf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, if you play golf, you don't have to work. People who are rich, they don't work. They just play golf all day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citraka:</span> ...newspapers, that now he is follower of Śaṅkarācārya in India. The queen of Greece. She's a follower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Queen of Greece. This cloth is very inconvenient... [break] ...illusion. Accepting this illusion, wherefrom the idea came? Just like in the tailor's window, there are nice beautiful women or men standing. That is illusion. Actually, that is neither man or woman. It is doll. But wherefrom the idea came of this illusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Unless there is a real man, a real woman, how the illusory man and woman is there, doll? Illusion means which is not fact. So the fact must be there; otherwise how the illusion, reflection, comes? Illusion is exemplified by the mirage, water in the desert. So the man is or the animal is running after water, but that is not water. This is illusion. But that does not mean there is no water. This is the conclusion. Unless there is real water, how... (aside) You can give around here. How this illusion of water is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Does that mean it is not possible to conceive of something that does not exist somewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the real fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Some of them say that Brahman creates illusion to forget that he is Brahman. They say that <span class="Italic">Brahman,</span> the one, creates illusion to forget that he's Brahman. That's his <span class="Italic">līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> Then you have to accept that Brahman is a person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say there is only one person. There's no varieties of persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But you have to accept the origin, the person. That is our philosophy. Then you accept our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Then they say, "Well it's not exactly a person, it's inconceivable."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you cannot say that He is not a person, because He is inconceivable. You cannot say whether He is person or not person, because you are illusioned, and inconceivable... But why you are thinking that because you cannot say perfectly, everyone cannot say perfectly? You are thinking like that. Just like we have got experience: one body cannot say something, but the other can say. Practical experience. Just like this child cannot say something but the father can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's their envious attitude. They are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not the question of envious. Because you are thinking that He is inconceivable, because you cannot say... But how can you say that another person cannot say? There are so many things I do not know. That does not mean that somebody else does not know. You may not know. Your experience is not mature. But how you can say, "Another person cannot have the experience"? So that is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, vedāhaṁ samatītāni, māṁ tu veda na kaścana:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26] "I know everything, but nobody knows Me." There is the answer. So nobody knows Kṛṣṇa. That's a fact. But Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself to the devotee. That is also said, <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">teṣām evānukampārtham<br class="calibre2"/>aham ajñāna-jaṁ tamaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>nāśayāmy ātma-bhāvastho<br class="calibre2"/>jñāna-dīpena bhāsvatā<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.11]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those who are devotees, to show them special favor, I remove the ignorance." So Māyāvādīs, <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are Māyāvādīs. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> does not allow them to see the cause of all causes, Kṛṣṇa. But if Kṛṣṇa reveals Himself, who can check it? Otherwise He is not Brahman.<span class="Italic"> </span>Brahman means the greatest. Brahman means the greatest, and He is Parabrahman. There are greatest demigods like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, but He's greater than them. He says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Brahmā and Śiva, they have come out from Kṛṣṇa, Viṣṇu. So Brahmā, Śiva may not know, but that does not mean Kṛṣṇa does not know. So we are receiving knowledge from Kṛṣṇa. We are not receiving. Or we are receiving knowledge from Kṛṣṇa's representative, who knows Kṛṣṇa. So that is our position. We are not as good as Kṛṣṇa, just the Māyāvādī rascals say. No. We are nothing. We have no value. But we accept what Kṛṣṇa says. That is our qualification. A child is ignorant, but if he speaks what he has learned from his father, that speaking is perfect. Similarly, we admit we are in illusion. But what we are speaking, because that is spoken by Kṛṣṇa, that is not illusion. That is not illusion. That is perfect. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It was raining very hard yesterday. Perhaps that's why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> All raining?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may be rain water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they fill it. Usually they fill it on Saturdays and Sundays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's too much for rain water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They practice fishing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fishing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Fly casting. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citraka:</span> ...open a temple in Greece?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I would like to open temples in every village, every city, what to speak of Greece. But we haven't got sufficient men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> This boy is from Greece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citraka:</span> I will translate the books later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then you can open. But alone... You can be assisted with some of our men. That's nice proposal. We want to open in every city, every village, village to village. So go this way or around the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> This isn't too bad. We can go this way. It's not too wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Citraka:</span> Sometimes you have said that the Greek mythology comes from the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly. In Greece I think some people know of our movement. Because in the airport as soon as some young men saw us, they chanted "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" Yes. Maybe they are Europeans, but I had practical experience. [break] which..., that Park Avenue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Wednesday they are having a meeting. Perhaps on Wednesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wednesday. So you have to attend? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, I don't have to attend. The lawyers attend. If I attend, it may ruin everything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...one is yogi. <span class="Italic">Karmī, jñānī,</span> yogi or <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> What is the difference between <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs,</span> yogis and <span class="Italic">bhakta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> wants to enjoy the gross senses, the <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> wants to enjoy the subtle mind, mental speculation, the yogi wants to manipulate the universe, mystic powers,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And a devotee has no material desires. (He wants) to serve Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And unless one is factually desireless, he cannot be happy. The <span class="Italic">karmī, jñānī,</span> yogi, they are all full of desires. Therefore they are unhappy. <span class="Italic">Karmīs</span> are the lowest of the unhappies, <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> are little advanced, yogis are little more advanced, and the perfection is the <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> devotees. <span class="Italic">Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ vā jagad-īśa kāmaye</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...siddhi-kāmī sakali aśānta. Bhukti</span> means <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> and <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> And <span class="Italic">siddhi, aṣṭa-siddhi,</span> magic power, mystic power. That is called <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> Those who are practicing yoga, if they are actually yogis, they can have <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-siddhi. Aṇimā, laghimā.</span> They can become smaller than the smallest, heavier than the heaviest. <span class="Italic">Mahimā, prāpti.</span> They can get anything they like. A yogi can get... Suppose if you want a pomegranate from Kabul, he will get immediately. Yes. That is yogi. As if he is snatching from the tree, yes. <span class="Italic">Prāpti-siddhi, īśitā.</span> They can force their influence upon anyone. <span class="Italic">Īśitā, vaśitā.</span> Yogis can hypnotize you. As he will say, you will act. As he will say, you will act. These yogis do that. They take something nonsense, "Now take gold," and you will think it is gold. Just like magician do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Hypnotist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hypnotist. They create heaps of money, the magician, I have seen it, all false.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Like in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Arjuna said like money created by magic word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. <span class="Italic">Prāpti-siddhi.</span> Now we are flying by aeroplane. A yogi can fly without any instrument. As Durvāsā Muni, he went even <span class="Italic">Vaikuṇṭha-loka.</span> Not <span class="Italic">Vaikuṇṭha-loka.</span> Within this planet, there is one planet where,<span class="Italic"> Śvetadvīpa,</span> Lord Viṣṇu lives. He went there and saw Lord Viṣṇu personally to request him to save him. He refused, "No, I cannot. You go to Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, beg pardon of him. If he pardons, then you will be saved." So to a devotee, innocent devotee, he had to fall down on his lotus feet, "Please save me." So what is the power of yogi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is the pure devotee more merciful than Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, yes. Because Viṣṇu could not excuse him, but as soon as he came to Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, fell down, and "You take all my assets of pious activities. You be saved immediately." That is <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava.</span> When he begged, humble, "Mahārāja Ambarīṣa, you save me, I am in danger." "Yes, you take all my pious activities' result. You be saved immediately." That is devotee. Viṣṇu refused, "No, I cannot give you protection." Therefore he is more merciful, although he was attacked, he was harassed. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna was merciful, "Let them enjoy. I don't want to kill them." Kṛṣṇa said, "You must kill. You must kill. Why you are deviating from your path? You must kill." Therefore he taught him <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> just to induce him to kill. But he was merciful, "No, they have done so much wrong to me, never mind. They are my relatives. I excuse. I don't want to fight." Yes. This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You see? Arjuna is more merciful than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa wanted to see them all killed because they were, I mean to say, offender to the devotee. Last time, Kṛṣṇa says, "Arjuna, you fight or not fight, it is already settled. They are not going back home. They will be killed here. If you like, you take the credit. That's all. It is already settled." Then Arjuna understood that "My Lord is so persistent. (laughter) Why shall I resist Him? All right, I will do what He says."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> You are more merciful than any of them, Prabhupāda. You have come to the western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Yes, Vaiṣṇava is, if one man is real Vaiṣṇava. Just like see Jesus Christ. It is said that he took everyone's sins and he was crucified. So how much merciful he is, just see. But these rascals have taken, that "Let us go on committing sinful activities, and Christ has taken contract. He will suffer. And we shall do this." Such rascals. You see. They say that "Our Christian religion is so good that even we commit sinful acts, Christ will suffer, we shall not suffer." Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I was reading yesterday in the <span class="Italic">Newsweek</span> that now the priests, they are dating with women and having sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must have because they have no spiritual knowledge. Anyone who is not spiritually advanced, he cannot avoid the sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You said yesterday, <span class="Italic">adānta-gobhiḥ</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Big, big yogis, they fell victim to sex. Viśvāmitra Muni, many other instances! Saubhari, Saubhari Muni. He was meditating within the water, and some fish just, what is called, licked up, his gender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Copulating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Copulating, yes. And he felt sex desire, that itching sensation. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham. Kaṇḍūyanam</span> means itching. It is actually itching. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says it is <span class="Italic">kaṇḍūyanam. Kaṇḍūyanam</span> means itching, the scratching, the itching. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Our scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Only one scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi puṁsas tapasaḥ śrutasya vā</span> [SB 1.5.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> Feeling all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. (indistinct) (pause) [break] Yes. I wanted to know the... So there are five kinds of air, material air, and the spirit soul is floating in the five kinds of air. I want to know these different functional activities of the five kinds of air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that also we admit. There are five kinds of air. <span class="Italic">Prāṇa, apāna,</span> like that. There are... By the yogis, by breathing exercise, they control the five kinds of air. So that also we admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, the scientists, they do not understand the five kinds of air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know so many things. What they will understand? Because they do not understand, therefore it has to be rejected. They are fools. What do they understand? Superfluous. Simply they see something outward. Just like they see the tree, but what do they understand about the seed? What do they understand? The tree is coming from the seed, but what do they understand about the seed? They see the tree, that's all. Like a child sees the tree and "Oh, it is a big tree." But intelligent man sees the seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They also see that the original seed the embryo is, remains dormant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. How it is made? That they do not know, how subtle things are being done... (aside) We can go this way. That is their ignorance. They do not know subtle things. Simply gross manifestation attracts their attention. That's all. <span class="Italic">Jaḍā-dṛṣṭi.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">jaḍā-dṛṣṭi,</span> material vision. No <span class="Italic">sukhā-dṛṣṭi.</span> Every, every field, they have no finer introspection. Simply gross. They deal with gross things. Just like the same example: Here is a tree, but it is a fact, this tree has grown from a small seed. So what do they know about the seed, how it is manufactured, how it has got the potency of bringing out such a big tree? Not only that, in that seed there will be millions of fruits, and each fruit there will be millions of seeds, and each seed contains again millions of trees. Where is your science? Where is that potency?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is a seed conscious, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. Everything is conscious. First of all, even gross manifestation we cannot understand, what to speak of consciousness. That is different thing. According to our philosophy, everything has got consciousness. Just like this tree has got consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The scientists also say that they have consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this tree's consciousness and my consciousness is different. My consciousness is developed. If you pinch on my body, my consciousness will be immediately protesting. But you cut, it will not protest. So consciousness is different. So there is nothing which has no consciousness, but it is a question of degree. It is a question of degree. The more the consciousness is covered, it is called material. The more the consciousness is developed, it is called spiritual. That is the difference between matter and spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, that verse in the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> that <span class="Italic">nityaḥ sarva-gataḥ sthāṇuḥ.</span> That verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that living beings are everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">sarva-ga. Acalo 'yaṁ sthāṇur sarva-gaḥ. Nitya. Nityaḥ sthāṇur acalo 'yam.</span> That is described. The seeds are everywhere. Just like they are trying to come out from this. You will find sometimes fracture, grass is coming. As soon as there is opportunity, they want to express the consciousness. Those who fall down... <span class="Italic">kṣīṇe puṇye punaḥ martya-lokaṁ viśanti.</span> They come with waters, rain water, and falls down on the ground and become grass. Then gradually, evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's terrible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ā-brahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino...</span> How subtle laws are working, what do they know the scientists? Therefore their so-called knowledge is <span class="Italic">māyayā apahṛta-jñānāḥ,</span> actual knowledge is taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And they are thinking, "I am very learned man, scholar." But actual knowledge is taken away. <span class="Italic">māyayā apahṛta-jñānāḥ.</span> Why? <span class="Italic">Āsuri-bhāva.</span> They won't accept God. Therefore they are all fools. In spite of all these degrees, they are all fools. Therefore they cannot explain everything very nicely. "In future we shall see."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are saying that "We are beginning to learn more and more..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means that you are fool. While you are in the process of learning, that means you are fool. Say directly that we are fool. That is gentlemanliness. You do not know; still, you pose, "I am, we are scholar, we are scientist. Give us Nobel Prize." You see. This is going on. We don't want Nobel Prize. We are giving the topmost knowledge. We don't hanker after Nobel Prize. But they give false knowledge and hanker after Nobel Prize. Just see. Their real aim is how to get the Nobel Prize by cheating. That is their real aim. How an educated man, learned man will cheat? So therefore my Guru Mahārāja used to say that "This modern human society, or always, it is a society of the cheaters and the cheated." Somebody is cheating and somebody's cheated, and they have combined together to make a so-called civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Prabhupāda, you know the scientist you quoted in <span class="Italic">Easy Journey?</span> You quoted an article from the newspaper in <span class="Italic">Easy Journey</span> about the two scientists who were studying anti-matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, about a year ago another scientist came forward, and he charged that those two scientists actually stole the knowledge from him. They were working with him, and they stole it to win Nobel Prize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are many scientists like that. Just like this Marconi, he stole the knowledge from Dr. Jagadisha Candra Bose. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I have heard this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jagadisha Candra... I was present. He said that "This man cheated me. I talked with him. Next morning he published the theory."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> About radio?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, newspaper. Because both of them were friends, scientists, they talked. And he took the clue, immediately published the theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Which theory was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Marconi wireless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Wireless, radio.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, radio. That was Jagadisha Candra Bose's discovery. But the government will not give the credit to the Indians. Because Jagadisha Candra Bose happened to be Indian. These Britishers they are so much envious. Therefore they will never admit that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken five thousand years ago. They bring all within the Christian period. That is their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> We went to a college and gave a class last week where the professor was saying that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is only two thousand years old, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They will never accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> One stupid guy was saying that there is some quotation in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> from Book of John.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is another rascaldom. <span class="Italic">Tava cārjuna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what about the heart transplant? The spirit soul is within the heart, but when the... in the medical science nowadays, the old heart can be replaced by a new one. So what happens with the spirit soul with the old one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that does not mean that new ones will increase their duration of life. That is our challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the personality is changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why changed? Suppose if I sit from this chair to this chair, why I am changed? I can change my seat. It does not mean that I am changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Change the heart also. The heart can change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The heart is seat, sitting place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the new heart had spirit soul from the new one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spirit soul, new or old there is. But if you can prove by changing the heart you can increase the duration of life, then you can catch the spirit soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That they're not able to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> None of them have lived very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot be. Because by <span class="Italic">karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> by superior arrangement, <span class="Italic">karmaṇā,</span> you have got this body. So you have to live within this body certain age. So if you change the body, new, that doesn't mean you prolong your life. That is not possible. It is the duration of life, that is considered. They are thinking by changing the heart they will increase the duration of life. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it is some sort of artificial transmigration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, like that. That transmigration taken... That is already explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just like a baby becomes a child, child becomes boy, boy becomes youth, like that. Transmigration it is going on continually. This is another type of transmigration. So it is a fact that by changing the heart the duration is not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, most of them, they have lived, a very short times. But still is it a fact that the soul is transplanted from one body to another body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That can be done, yes. Sometimes yogis, they can perform that better body, he transfers himself into that body. Just Śaṅkarācārya did, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> What they do, though, they wait till someone's dying or dead, and immediately after they die, they take the heart. From somebody who had the weak heart they transplant, change the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what...? There is no benefit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But that does not mean that the soul from the old heart, or the new heart is being changed into the new body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The soul has already left. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the soul is individual. As I told yesterday that dead body has got the ingredients to produce life. But that the man who has left his body, you cannot produce him. That is the proof of individuality. That is the proof of individuality. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I was saying that they transplant the heart... After the first man, his soul has already gone, then they take his heart and put it into the other man, who has a weak heart. So all it means is that the soul is going from one heart to another heart, not that the soul, that they are taking the soul with it when they put the heart in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is destined to live in that body for a certain years. So you may change whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The heart is just an instrument in the machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is a place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Now it's very clear. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is superior overlooking. That is Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">anumantā, upadraṣṭā. Upadraṣṭā anumantā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> One man, Dr. Wyberg from South Africa, he was the first successful heart transplant. So as soon as he got out of the hospital he started drinking and having sex life. (laughter) He was saying, "How wonderful science is. It can prolong my enjoyment." Then he died about a year later from too much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material life. As soon as they get some opportunity, they will have sex. That is the only hope. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Here the only happiness is sex. Otherwise they are working so hard like asses. Why? Only for that sex. The only aim is "I will enjoy sex at night." That's all. That is the only aim. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi.</span> It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham.</span> They are attracted with the most abominable thing, sex life. Yes. <span class="Italic">Tuccham. Tuccham</span> means very abominable, very insignificant thing. The position of the sex, the... How nasty it is! Just like crows, they enjoy in a nasty place. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Tad vāyasa-tīrtham. Vāyasa</span> means crows. The crows, as they enjoy...

That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> When a woman comes to serve you, you must know it is covered well.

That is first instruction. And if you are completely unable, all right, get yourself married. Otherwise there is no need of sex life. Why one should have sex life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then how to continue the species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you will continue? You finish it, this condemned world, where you are simply suffering. Why should you continue it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because that is the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, laws of nature if you want. If you want to be condemned, then laws of nature is there. Otherwise laws of nature is teaching you how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Just like police. Police business is to make you lawful. If you become lawful, there is no question of police. There is no question of police law. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">. Māyā</span> is kicking you one after another so that you may come to sense that "This life is not good." But we are so foolish that we say, "No, it is good." <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi.</span> "There is sex life. Oh, it is very good." This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You give the analogy in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that it's like pouring gas onto a fire you're trying to put out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said like putting gas on the fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So increase the fire. Yes. But because we have got this body, we have to utilize it to make the best use of a bad bargain. Therefore marriage is allowed, <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life is allowed, not for increasing sex life, but to finish it as soon as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But, Śrīla Prabhupāda, even in the very lower forms of life, there are some species, they reproduce without any sex? It's called asexual reproduction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Oh yes. These bugs, bedbugs, they produce by this blood. You kill...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We cannot check reproduction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how can you check? There are so many living entities. They have come to this material world to enjoy. So the reproduction must go on. Just like you cannot stop the jail. You come out, but another is ready to enter it. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So it is within this material platform that we develop the consciousness by which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was answered by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. One of His devotee, Vāsudeva Datta, he said, "Sir, You have come. You take all the living entities of this universe and release them from this life. And if You think that they are so sinful, they cannot be, then give their all sins to me. But You take them." So Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "Suppose if I take this universe, the all living entities, do you think the business will be finished? This universe is just like a mustard seed in the bag of mustard seeds." (laughs) So from the bag of mustard seeds, if you take one mustard seed, what is the loss there? So this cannot be stopped. So <span class="Italic">anantāya kalpate.</span> There are so many, unlimited number of living entities. So this will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> You said in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> that the material world is like a correction house for the living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So everybody should develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.
