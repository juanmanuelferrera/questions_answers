<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yes. And, uh, some, there's a few similarities in the religion, I think, because they have a fearful goddess like Mahā-kālī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Worship Mahā-kālī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Like Mahā-kālī, yes, very fearful, you know. She's, er, her head comes from two serpent's heads.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> No, not Mexico City. (indistinct) I have relatives in Mexico City. When I was there this summer I went to visit one other Hindu establishment that comes down from Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru Dāsa:</b> Where's the name "Maya" civilization come from?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> From that illness you had when you came to India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> When you were recovering from your stroke?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Which philosophy you are following?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Uh, Buddha philosophy, and uh, Vedānta and uh, Kṛṣṇa philosophy. I have a Tibetan teacher now, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He also teaches Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Uh, he teaches uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Buddha. Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So how you will adjust Kṛṣṇa philosophy and Buddha philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well it's just a different uh, approach. But I don't think there's any fundamental difference. I mean if you, if you, uh, have the ultimate consciousness in one, you have it in the other, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So there is difference. Buddha philosophy does not accept God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yeah. It's a atheistic approach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> It's a atheistic approach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No soul, no God. Our Kṛṣṇa philosophy is God, soul, and Vedānta philosophy, that is also God. So Buddha philosophy different from Vedānta philosophy and Kṛṣṇa philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The approach is different, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The approach is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Approach? The end is different. Now how you'll adjust Buddha philosophy and Kṛṣṇa philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> There's a few, uh, paradoxes I..., but uh, anyway, I asked the same key question to uh, to my, uh, Tibetan teacher, and, uh, because he was, he was putting down everybody else and calling everybody else except his philosophy heretics. So then I asked him, I said, "Now this experience that all those different people say that they have achieved, you know," I says, uh, "is it substantially different or not?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Achieved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Achieved. You know-attained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Achieved. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> And uh, then he started to say, "Well if they believe in an external God,'' or something like that, "then it is heretical.'' I says, "But nevertheless,'' I says, "Uh, like in the writings of, say, Meister Eckhart or the different mystics, they all seem to describe their experience in pretty much similar terms." So I said, I asked him, "Does this mean that the experience is different or not?'' So then he argued, he finally says.... Well, he didn't say it directly, but what he said is that if, if you want to get the experience of touching something to find out what hot is, he says you may have different motive. Like some people may do it because it's pretty, some out of curiosity or different motive. In other words, he admitted that the experience finally was the same, even though the approach was different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If the approach is different, suppose in the approach is to fire, the approach may be different, but heat or light is there. So why do they approach fire? But if you are approaching something else, how the same experience is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Say we approach fire, then approach may be a different way, but the goal, it is fire, you will experience heat and light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, approaching means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if the approach is different, then how you will experience heat and light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yes, but what are we approaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> What are we approaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That you have to explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The Absolute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We say approaching Kṛṣṇa, the Absolute. We have got Kṛṣṇa's form, we have Kṛṣṇa's name, we have personal address, His pastime. Just like you know me, I know you, means I have got form, you have got form, I know your qualities, you know my qualities; therefore we know each other. But if the approach is void, then how the approach is the same? There must be something tangible; then the approach is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, I know your philosophy, cause I was very intimately involved with it, but I still believe that if, uh, your uh, you may have a different style, and you may call it Kṛṣṇa consciousness or you may call it <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa,</i> but I think that ultimately it's, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I can, I can explain Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but you cannot explain <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>. That is the difficulty. I can explain my position but you cannot explain your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> How is it that I cannot explain my position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then explain what do you mean by <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well it's the ultimate state of consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where is <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i> when you do not know the meaning of <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>? <i class="calibre3">Nirvāṇa</i> means finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Uh, yes. I think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Nirvāṇa</i> means everything finished, void.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Etymologically it means "no wind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> "No wind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No wind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The root of the word, I believe, means "no wind." There's no wind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. You can derive many meanings, but <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i> means, just like flame is there, extinguished, finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> That's not the way I understand <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> That's not the way I understand <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But this is the meaning, dictionary meaning, <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>. <i class="calibre3">Nirvāṇa</i> means there is flame and you extinguish. This is <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> You want some more vegetables and <i class="calibre3">purīs?</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Give him. More, more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Not more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> If it is an extinguishing, it's only an extinguishing of desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> If there's an extinguishing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If desire is extinguished, then what you are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> But it's not extinguishing of desire; it's transforming of desire. Like this is one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is not extinguishing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Right. But in the sense it is, uh, the uh, flame of, uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That we say. You don't extinguish desire but we purify desire. That is our... But that is not the void, <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa</i> means finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, the way, uh, the way it's interpreted, you know, by the people that practice it, is that, uh, you don't extinguish your desires either but they're transformed into the Buddha principles. They say this is the meaning of Mahayana Buddhism, is that you, uh, learn to identify the desire passions with the Buddha principles, and so they become transformed so that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Transformed to what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, for instance lust is supposed to be transformed into compassion, and the other uh, the other passion desires are transformed to something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then it is not <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>. It is real condition. Then that is our principle. That is not <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>. Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, this is what I mean by <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You mean, but you the word <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>. Suppose I take out your eyes. This is one thing. And I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Gopāla wants to see you. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Suppose I take out your eyes. That is <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa.</i> But if there is some disease, I cure it, that is (indistinct). Suppose cataract, cataract operation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, um, whatever the origin, so the word may be etymologically, the way it's used by the people that I'm studying with and the way I understand the meaning of the word is a little different than meaning just uh, sheer nothingness. Sheer nothingness is supposed to be a misunderstanding of what <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i> means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now you have to understand as it is in the dictionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well, as it is used by people. You have to understand it as, as it's used, you know, in uh, by, by the people who are using this word to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa</i> means, I have already explained, this is the people take, those who know Sanskrit, <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i> means extinguished. Now, you may have different meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Right. Words change meaning as time goes on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Words, I mean their root may be one thing, but then as time goes on the, uh, word doesn't remain, uh, the same as used by uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway, you can give your own meaning. What do you mean by <i class="calibre3">nirvāṇa</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> <i class="calibre3">Nirvāṇa</i> is identifying your, uh, ah, passion desires with the innate Buddha principles, in this system.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Symptoms of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> In this system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> System? What is that system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The, uh, Mahayana Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh. So what is that practically?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The practical result?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> The practical result is, uh.... I don't see it as being far different from Kṛṣṇa consciousness, though the approach may be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What Kṛṣṇa consciousness is stress is always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, <i class="calibre3">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.65]<i class="calibre3">.</i> It is directly always thinking of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> So that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> To offer obeisances to Kṛṣṇa, to worship Kṛṣṇa, to become devotee of Kṛṣṇa, this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you should talk from the platform of Buddha. We know the secrecy. Our, our understanding of Buddha, that he is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. But the Buddhists, they do not believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> No, they've rejected the <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. But we say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> But I'm not trying to, uh, to set up, to argue sect against sect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's not the question. It's a question of philosophy. Here we just say, we know, just like we, we are devotee of Lord Buddha, <i class="calibre3">keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare</i>. We glorify Lord Buddha because we know what is Buddha, <i class="calibre3">sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam.</i> So we know perfectly that he is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, but those who are cheated by Buddha, from their point of view I want to know what is their perspective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Now how, how, how, why would Buddha want to cheat people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, cheated because they did not believe in God. So, but he is God, he is God; therefore he says, "What I say, you believe.'' That means he is cheating them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> He didn't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Buddha didn't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then why do you, why do you study Buddha philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Well he said, "You study Buddha philosophy to arrive at principles of truth,'' but what Buddha said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. Buddha philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> What Buddha said was, he says, "Don't accept anything because I tell it to you. Don't accept anything because it's been believed for a long time by many people in many different places.'' He says, "Only believe that which you find true for yourself, and that is for your own good and for the good of others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But these are teachings of Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Huh, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> But he's pointing at how to arrive at principles of truth. This, this is, uh, more uh, of an independent approach. He's not uh, I don't think he was trying to cheat anybody but he was trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not that. Cheating this sense, sometimes just so you, I cheat my child. The father is not cheater, but sometimes it is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Cheating, yeah, tells him that forest leaves are made out of gold to keep the child from crying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. So the father's cheating is not cheating, but from external point of view it is cheating. You want something, I give something. That is cheating. But that cheating is good for you. When father cheats the child, it is good for the child, but it is cheating. Therefore cheating is not always bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yes. A great Buddhist saint once said the same thing. He says that "All the scriptures and everything, it means just this, is that it's pretending that forest..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Good, good lessons for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> "...leaves are made out of gold to keep children from crying,'' meaning that you have to arrive at truth from your own self, your own understanding. Nobody can, you know, no blind following, as you yourself say. I remember correctly that you used to preach and say, uh, that uh, you shouldn't accept anything blindly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That, in the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> it is said, <i class="calibre3">sammohāya sura-dviṣām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.3.24]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Lord Buddha appeared for cheating or bewildering the atheistic person. They do not believe in the (indistinct). They did not, did not believe in God, but God is there. Lord Buddha himself is God. Just like if I say I don't want (indistinct), but you come in a different place. So (indistinct) is there, but I am thinking it is not (indistinct). Similarly, God is there-Buddha-but they are thinking that they don't believe in God. This is cheating. God is there. They are worshiping Lord Buddha exactly as we worship Kṛṣṇa. Then is it not the same? Then how do they say they don't believe in God? They are made to believe in God in a different way. That is cheating, and it is good for them. That is written in <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sammohāya sura-dviṣām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.3.24]<i class="calibre3">.</i> [break] They're Australian.

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> ...communication, the only way of talking to the spiritual master to communicate is verbal talking, the only way in which one can communicate with his spiritual master?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Hm. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> ...which I've always been afraid to ask, because I don't know if it's proper, but you being the external manifestation of Supersoul, if we are having questions, doubts, when, in your absence, if we are receiving indications, is there any possible way that someone who is so conditioned can have any understanding of proper action in your absence? In other words, if I am in your absence and I am in great doubt, and I am praying to Supersoul to please save me somehow, if I receive some action which I must do or some course of action becomes obvious, should I trust that, considering that you're communicating with me, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That depends on purity. If one has become pure, without any material desire, then that is possible. But if there is some material desire, we cannot expect direct communication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> So I have much material desire.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> So the nature of the communication with the spiritual master in our state is only through...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Spiritual master... Kṛṣṇa is also spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But Kṛṣṇa sends spiritual master, His representative, as you can appreciate, externally, directly. Otherwise, Kṛṣṇa is already spiritual master. He could give you instruction from the very beginning. But why He is sending His representative? What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> We're not able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Ah, because unless we are completely purified, Kṛṣṇa will, does not talk directly. Therefore you have to understand Kṛṣṇa through the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> So when we are having doubts, the only possible way, no matter what the indications are, are simply follow your instructions in all circumstances.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. <i class="calibre3">Caitya-guru.</i> One has to take the order of Kṛṣṇa through the media, via media of spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> So all of my activities, unless they are directly following your order, are more or less a concoction of my mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. [break] ...office, you cannot contact the proprietor directly. There are subordinate officers. Through them you have to take the proprietor's help. The office master is there. You have to satisfy the office master. You cannot directly approach the proprietor. If you satisfy the office master, then your promotion and other things is all right. But if you want to... I have got practical experience. One of my friend, he was working in office. So the proprietor was there and many other employees were there. So that my friend, he suggested something to the proprietor, and the proprietor immediately dismissed him: "Oh, this man want to suggest me. Dismiss immediately. Give him his pay he will require.'' In that I have got practical experience. He later on became so sorry. Now it is the process. So this is practical. We should not try to approach directly Kṛṣṇa. That is not the right way. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <i class="calibre3">gopī-bhartuḥ pada-kamalayor dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ:</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80] "I am the servant of the servant of.''

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b> Associating with you is so wonderful, and yet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just like here in Vṛndāvana, I was here, as I am sitting here. I was sitting here in this very place. That was (indistinct). And when I was hungry I could take my food there, same place. So that is one thing. Just like there are many persons, but because my spiritual master wanted, so I, at seventy years old, when I thought, "Now I shall go,'' I went, to serve the order of my spiritual master. Otherwise I am sitting here in Vṛndāvana. I am old man, I was chanting. Therefore, because that is my first business.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> To carry his order. That is purification. If you create your own atmosphere, then you become impure. If you simply carry out the order of your spiritual master, then you will be benefited. If you do your own business, that is not good. You can not do anything which is not ordered by your spiritual master. Of course, everyone should have sense. It is not that we are dull, stone. Unless it is moved, it cannot... You have got moving power. But the basic issue should be to carry out the orders of his spiritual master. That is your president. Otherwise you are not.</div>
