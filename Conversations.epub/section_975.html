<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is so rich(?) man. He cannot get nice food even, the primary necessity. Getting jaundice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The main reason why he doesn't.... I think he got jaundice because, he admitted, is that he had Ravi Shankar's brother cooking for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He had Kumar Shankar, the brother of Ravi Shankar, cooking for him. So this man is a demon; therefore he is becoming sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are all drunkards, all third-class men, fourth-class men, low-class men. In India, this <span class="Italic">naṭas,</span> they are third class, fourth class. <span class="Italic">Naṭas</span> means the artist class, singer, dancers. They are meant for the fourth-class, fifth-class men. It was never taken by the.... They are called, and they will expertly sing, dance, in some festival. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, vaiśyas,</span> they were not doing. Still in India there is a class, very expert in dancing, singing, low class. Their hereditary business is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So you have given everything. You have given all the structure. We have to present it rightly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even, say, hundred years ago, that Girish Chandra Ghosh, he wanted to introduce theatrical performances, imitating the European theatrical performances, man and woman taking part. So he wanted to invite woman artist. Not a single woman joined. Who will go to public stage to dance, respectable girl? They'll never. That is hundred years. I am speaking, say, about forty years ago. In one of our Dayanika(?) men, the girl was to be married, and it is the custom in India-the bridegroom's party comes to see the girl, whether she is right. Similarly, the girl's party goes to see the.... So they came to see one of my friend's daughter, and the daughter is very beautiful, rich man's daughter. So one of the bridegroom's party questioned, "You know how to dance?" That was the question to the girl: "You have learned something about dancing and singing?" So she was my friend's daughter, my, that friend, Mukunda Mati. His elder brother was there. He became very angry, that "This rascal is asking our daughter whether she knows dancing and singing." She took it as.... He took it as insult, that "Respectable family, daughter should learn how to dance, how to sing?" So immediately he protested, "No, no, no, she does not know how to dance, how to sing. She's not meant for that purpose. We like, of course, a young girl dancing and singing, but we cannot teach our family members. We spend for that outside. You cannot expect our Mullik's family daughter dancing and singing. No. He is well, good(?)." Actually that is.... Dancing? Singing? What is this nonsense? For a respectable family? It is meant for the low-class professional. Pay them, they will dance. Or go to some prostitute. She will dance. So he said that "We have got some taste for dancing, but not that our family members should do that. We pay for that outside." So this art.... And among the theatrical, Girish Chandra Ghosh could not get a single response from any respectable family. Then he had to seek some young girl from the prostitute class. They became later on famous artists, Kusumakali Dāsī, this Dāsī.... Nowadays it has become a fashion that aristocratic family should join this cinema and spoil their character. Otherwise it was meant for the.... No respectable man.... You find the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> description, especially for the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> the professional who would come. They'll take their reward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This class is very influential today. This cinema artist, performer. Whenever there's a Presidential race...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like George. What is his value? He's artist, that's all. From educational point of view, from things other view, he does not know anything. But he has got some money on account of his artistic play on it(?), and he's big man, that's all. Somehow or other get money, you become a big man. There is no question of culture or anything. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> The money will be the criterion-no family, culture, education. These things will not be taken into account. If you have got money, then you are big man. Never mind what you are. Therefore people are after money. Who is going to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>? If you become a perfect <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who will care for you? Nobody is interested to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> "Why we shall become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>? Starve? For starvation?" Nowadays the colleges, they're not interested in art, philosophy, English literature. No, they.... Nobody.... They go for technical, how they will get more money. They do not want. Some of the doctor, professor, they came to request us to give our student. They are not getting student. And after few years they'll be all dismissed. Who will pay them? Hayagriva told me. He's not getting any job. There is another, Mr., Dr. Henderson. He's also not getting any job. He's selling insurance. And Bon Mahārāja, his institute is suffering from the very beginning till now, simply begging, begging and paying, paying the professor. No student. First of all he started Vaiṣṇava philosophy, so doctorate, Ph.D. So especially in India, who is going to take Ph.D. in Vaiṣṇava philosophy and starve? So this is failure. It is already failure, but he is persistent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Therefore people are very surprised we are not starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why we shall starve?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We are not starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are, rather, inviting, "Come here. Live comfortably. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Then what is the difference between Kṛṣṇa's state and ordinary state? When I see so many young boys are taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> I become so happy that they are having <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and good chance for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. They are living in the best house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Even the churches, they are not feeding people like this. They have so much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know whose money, how to spend it. Bokāloka. In the evening I took that watermelon juice? That created havoc whole night. I think so. So for breakfast you can prepare that soup, the little. Just put vegetable soup.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nothing else? No fruits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can keep, if I like I can take. But vegetable soup.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What time would you like breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Half past seven, eight. We are publishing one book, <span class="Italic">Dialectic Spiritualism.</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Harikeśa Mahārāja's book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, no. Another one Prabhupāda's spoke, the philosophy book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh, the philosophy book will be called <span class="Italic">Dialectic Spiritualism</span>? Ah, very good title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">A Vedic View of Western Philosophy.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Very good title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. If one actually interested in real philosophy, they must come to spiritualism. <span class="Italic">Ātma-tattvam.</span> That is <span class="Italic">ātma-tattvam. Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.</span> So long they do not come to this platform of understanding <span class="Italic">ātma-tattva,</span> whatever rascal they are doing, simply defeat, that's all. <span class="Italic">Parābhava.</span> Simply frustration and defeat. This very word, <span class="Italic">parābhava,</span> means defeat. <span class="Italic">Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jātaḥ.</span> Why he's defeated? <span class="Italic">Abodha-jātaḥ.</span> Because by birth he's a rascal. <span class="Italic">Abodha-jātaḥ.</span> And this will continue <span class="Italic">yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam.</span> So long he's not enlightened to inquire about spirit and the science of spirit, he'll remain in that, that, what is called, defeat position or conquered position. So we have to now increase our scope. Everything we have got. And if you don't come to this platform, <span class="Italic">ātma-tattva,</span> then your all attempt will be defeat. You are already defeated, frustrated, simply struggling, that's all. Either take the capitalist or communist, who has conquered? Everyone is defeated. One party may be proud that "We have been victorious." What victory you have got? What is the victory? Not that the communist countries, they are all happy. This is not the fact. Then where is your victory? Simply beating the drum that they have got victory, victory? "We have gone to moon planet. We have gone to Mars." Cheating innocent public. Is that victory? The girls are working that side? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, they won't come for another half hour yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They can come earlier if you like. They can come any time you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...No, I have no objection. What is that? They'll work that side; I'll sit down here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They should come now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our program is solid, but if we have to argue with animals, that is a different thing. Otherwise any human being, they will accept. But the modern civilization means to keep the people in general in animal platform, that's all, and cheat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Most of the people who..., they are becoming attracted to this communist philosophy. They have no idea how to practically apply it. All they are saying is "It is an opportunity to take from the rich and give me to enjoy." But they are not seeing any scope of community cooperation. This is all impractical. They are saying, "I will get money from my boss. I will take his wealth and distribute." They are simply materialists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "That also distribute for me. More share for me." (laughs) Now there is drought; there is no rain. What the capitalists or communists can do in this connection? If they are able to present any program how to counteract? Then where is your progress? When there is some calamity, you both of you simply (indistinct). That's all. You cannot do anything. Then where is your progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The reason why the Russians were buying wheat from America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...was because they had no rain. All their crops failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Not only that, people aren't inclined to work very hard. The farmers are not very enthusiastic to work very hard, because they work very hard, but they have to give all the fruit away. So because they are <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they want the fruit. The state is taking the fruit; therefore they don't want to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they shall work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They have no incentive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I'll work and you'll enjoy." Why shall they work? That is natural tendency. This can be possible only for Kṛṣṇa. "I'll work; Kṛṣṇa will enjoy." That's all. That is only possible in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's a fact. Therefore it's the only practical communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I shall fight, give my all best, and Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied." So that.... Arjuna for his personal, he did not..., decline, but when he saw that "Kṛṣṇa wants it? All right." That is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prema.</span> "Never mind I shall be aggrieved by killing my kinsmen, but Kṛṣṇa will be satisfied. That's all right." This is Kṛṣṇa philosophy. We cannot find this philosophy in the material world that "I shall work, and so many will be satisfied." That is not possible. "If I work, I must be satisfied." So these communists, they will work according to.... Everyone will show that "I have no capacity." So the production will reduce. And they'll have to beg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They've had to introduce capitalistic type incentives in many of the communist countries in order to induce the people to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not capitalistic. This is Kṛṣṇa conscious. They'll have to learn how to love Kṛṣṇa, and for Kṛṣṇa, they are prepared to do anything. That is philosophy. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is first class, Vaiṣṇava. <span class="Italic">Yenātmā suprasīdati.</span> Who knows this verse? Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsām paro dharmo [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> First Canto. "The first-class occupation is that which brings love of God. When uninterested, unmotivated, it brings satisfaction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Who will understand this philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsām paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"The supreme occupation, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> for all humanity is that by which men can attain to loving devotional service unto the transcendent Lord. Such devotional service must be unmotivated and uninterrupted in order to completely satisfy the self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the communist teaching that "You love Lenin," and the capitalist teaching that "You love Washington," so nobody's satisfied. Unless the love comes to Kṛṣṇa, there is no question of satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's no reciprocation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, there must be defect because the love is reposed in some defective or imperfect personality. It may be Lenin or it may be Washington. It doesn't matter. He's imperfect. Love is there. Otherwise why so many people are working? But because it is misplaced, they are not satisfied. Therefore it is stated, <span class="Italic">yato bhaktir adhokṣaje. Adhokṣaje,</span> this word, is used. God.... They may say that "Where is God?" And therefore the word is <span class="Italic">adhokṣaje:</span> "beyond your sense perception." Everything is within sense perception. So therefore this very word is used, that "You cannot see, you cannot perceive, but still, you have to love Him." <span class="Italic">Adhokṣaje.</span> They say, therefore, that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is some ideal, imagination, Kṛṣṇa. They think.... They say, I have an imaginary form of Kṛṣṇa, a stone, and "Unnecessarily they are wasting their time, loving Kṛṣṇa." What is their theory? You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Some people think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are some. They are not all. Even they criticize that "You cannot see Kṛṣṇa." So similar argument can be, "You do not see Lenin. Why you are worshiping?" That's it. "Is Lenin present before you? So why you are worshiping?" You'll see. You have got, in Moscow got, every street corner a big picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're trying to replace everybody's desire to worship some greater authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, but if you or somebody argues, "Where is Lenin? You are.... Why you are worshiping? You cannot see Lenin..." Because they say, "Where is your Kṛṣṇa? You are worshiping a statue," so we can say the same thing, "Where is your Lenin? The statue, it is?" In the airport station, street crossing and everywhere there is picture. And they go to worship Lenin's tomb every day. Many other fools also go there, tourists, that Red Square. They tried in India for Jawaharlal Nehru's tomb, for Gandhi's tomb. So in the beginning there was little crowd. Now nobody goes. But Vṛndāvana, Govindaji's temple, Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple? Without invitation-crowd. This is culture. (loud chanting begins in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Marx, he has written only little book, and you have written so many books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he know, he'll write? What does he know that he will write? He can bluff people for.... That's all. Here is Vyasadeva, <span class="Italic">vidvān.</span> So</div>
<div class="Verse">anarthopaśamam sākṣād<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>lokasyājānato vidvāṁś<br class="calibre2"/>cakre sātvata-saṁhitām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.7.6]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">You have found? Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyasadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here is <span class="Italic">vidvān,</span> and there is a rascal. He does not know how people will be helped. Where you got these beads?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchased?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Someone gave them as gift, <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Hawaii there are so many <span class="Italic">tulasīs</span> dry wood. We can make those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In our preaching this is good point, that we do not alienate the communists and stress on the differences between us and them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> That can come later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they see practically that "We are theorizing while they're practically doing." So expand this farming project, self-help and peaceful life for spiritual culture. I saw that Philadelphia farm is better organized than all others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, in Pennsylvania they have the best farm. It is the best farm. When they bought it, it already had all this equipment and best flat farmland, whereas New Vrindaban, they have such a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hilly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Hilly, and the place was originally not very nice. Everything is built from scratch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The management in New Vrindaban is a lot more difficult as well, because they've tried to avoid machinery, so the whole concept of farming without any complicated machinery...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have got so many machine. In New Vrindaban there are so many machinery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not so much tractors and things though. They've been trying to concentrate with just oxen and things like that, so it's taken a while to develop the whole concept, whereas in Pennsylvania they're using so many machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not producing various things(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In our Vancouver farm, because we had machinery, we were able to put more land under cultivation in the first year than they had in New Vrindaban after so many years. They were very efficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Thing is, we should not become dependent on machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This unemployment is to their discredit. In the <span class="Italic">karmis'</span> society the unemployment is a great discredit, now people sitting idle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be great catastrophe. The unemployment will increase, and people will be very dissatisfied with the.... Especially the black. They will create havoc. This is artificial. They are increasing the production of tire tube and lid. So who will purchase? Nobody lives in the tire tube. Therefore unemployment. So therefore reduce production. You cannot go on increasing. You very much trade this tire tube and so many artificial.... It is very artificial civilization. If you produce.... [break] Here so far milk and food grains are concerned, whatever sumptuously you want to eat, eat. Balance you can keep stock. The milk can be converted into ghee, then keep stock, and the grains can be stocked. Whenever you like, you just grind the grains and have to eat, halava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's very ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got excess, you can distribute free <span class="Italic">prasadam.</span> "Come on." You make friends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You gave one argument before about this meat-eating. You say, "If you want to eat meat, that is all right. Why you don't wait until the animal dies naturally?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> "He's going to die one day. So you wait. Now, in the meantime, you can eat cats and dogs."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> While waiting for the cows to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, cats and dogs they are eating. Yes. Hong Kong. they are eating. Who said that one gentleman came to Hong Kong hotel? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One of the devotees in America. Some man came with his pet dog. So in America they tie up the dogs outside the restaurant, so he did that and he went in. And then he pointed, he showed the doorman his dog, meaning that he was liable to look after him. So after he'd eaten his meal he went out and his dog was gone. So after some inquiry they found out that when he showed the doorman the dog, he misunderstood and thought that he wanted to eat it, that he was bringing his lunch with him, so he took the dog and killed it and served him. He ate his dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> A local policeman said that in England there are more laws protecting the dogs than there are protecting the children. If you beat your children, then no problem. If you beat your dog, immediately they'll come arrest you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I've seen in India, they are bringing foreign dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Even that one <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> in Vṛndāvana, he has got French dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That poodles. He's rascal. And such a fool, "<span class="Italic">Jagat-guru.</span>" So you go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
