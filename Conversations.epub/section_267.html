<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply for Kṛṣṇa, there is simply to understand Kṛṣṇa. Anything else-waste of time. But in Kṛṣṇa's connection there are varieties. Does it mean, although the dictaphone is there, still I shall write in my hand? Kṛṣṇa consciousness cannot touch this. We don't follow this nonsense philosophy. Unnecessary <span class="Italic">vairāgya. Śuṣka-vairāgya,</span> dry knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Śuṣka-vairāgya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śuṣka, śuṣka</span> means dry. Oh, it is material, I shall not touch. I shall not touch. Just like that rascal, Ramakrishna, if anyone wanted to give him some money (gesture). (laughter) How, he does not touch money. These rascals, why shall I not touch? Come on, you have got money, George Harrison, spend. Yes, come on, I shall take it, for Kṛṣṇa. We haven't come to this house for living very comfortably and enjoying. No, we have come here for Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This point is revolutionary in spiritual circles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is Kṛṣṇa's property. It is not my property, neither George's property. This is mistake. Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. So it must be utilized for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Simply they don't know <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They don't know <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, therefore they don't understand us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Therefore I say, all... Immediately, how you are all rascals. We have got a test. Test tube. As soon as one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is rascal, he is miscreant, he is lowest of the mankind, he has no knowledge. These, these are groups, they belong to. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ.</span> He maintains that he is very big man, Nixon, but we know that he is a rascal number one. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You can understand immediately what is what. By this test:</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">[break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...you said if he's coming from God, then what difference does it make?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see that you are a fool (but) God is not fool. That is the difference. But God is (indistinct), He'll not speak foolish. Because he is above all this foolishness but you are within the foolishness. That is the difference. Try to answer them like that. You are within the status of foolishness, <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and God is above <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> If God is also within the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> as the rascal Māyāvādīs say, then what is the use of God? We are everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> They just accumulate knowledge just for knowledge sake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not just for knowledge because they do not get any knowledge. They have no knowledge. What is the knowledge? They talk all nonsense. What is the knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> His argument was "Well there's no point in talking about this matter. All of us accept this." He's saying: all big authorities, they accept this point of view, that this was recently written literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they don't know who are authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You manufacture your own authorities. You do not know. That is your misfortune. You do not know who is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They all smoke cigarettes and they think they're authorities. They're nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I met another old authority on Sanskrit and he is sitting behind his desk and his whole body is shaking: "No, I'm not interested in the spiritual side of these <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> I'm just interested in the Sanskrit." He's dying you know, and still he's like that. That's their authority. You can't save them but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adhyaki, adhyaki(?),</span> therefore <span class="Italic">adhyaki(?).</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What's that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> External. <span class="Italic">Adhyaki(?).</span> (indistinct) ...one is interested in the body not in the soul. So he is a fool. This, this sculptor, he is simply interested in the outward body, he has no knowledge of the soul. And he wants to become a very famous man, remaining in the category of asses. Because one who is in the bodily concept of life, he is an ass. <span class="Italic">Go-khara, khara</span> means ass. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">. Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who is in the bodily concept of life he is no better than animal. The cats and dogs, they are also in the bodily concept of life. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So he has not advanced beyond these cats and dogs because he is in the same conception, that I am this body. A dog cannot understand that you are not this body. So similarly, if the human being cannot understand that he is not this body, what is the difference between him and the dog? So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">sa eva go-kharaḥ: [SB </span>10.84.13] he's no better than the cows and the asses. That's all. And actually it is a fact. The first instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, they cannot take it, and they're scholars. That is the most regrettable situation that these fools and rascals under the bodily concept of life, they are become authorities. Actually they are asses. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I used to observe when I was going to the university that all my professors, their intellectual business was just a profession like digging ditches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. For earning money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> For their pleasure they're going home to drink beer and eat steak. That's all they're really interested in. They're just working to make money. I could see it and I didn't want to follow their footsteps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> he cleans in the road for money. They are going as professor but the category is the same. You don't make any distinction between that sweeper and this professor. Or a hog and cat and dog. The hog is also working hard, whole day and night for stool, eating. So this man is also working like that. Beyond that he has no other knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The scientists, they have a term. Psychologists, they call it the <span class="Italic">idiot savant.</span> The <span class="Italic">idiot savant</span> means he's an idiot but he has one particular talent and because of that talent he can get along. Just like sometimes you find an idiot, he can look at a column of figures and he can compute the sum in his head very easily but he can't even understand how to tie his shoes. And I think these scholars are like that, they're actually idiots but they have one talent for Sanskrit or for history and because of that they can get along. They can support their body but otherwise they have no qualifications.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdra.</span> Unless he gets that post, he'll starve. He has got some talent in some particular subject but he must get some service. By serving others, he'll be able to utilize his talent and get some money, then he'll eat. This is <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> business. Dog's business. Just like a dog unless he has got a nice master, his position is very precarious. A street dog. Nobody will care neither it is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You point out in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that they go to school and learn to become Ph.D., then they have to knock on the door for a job and no one will open the door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No vacancy, sir. So just like dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But they have a way to force them to work. The politicians force the scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If they don't print books, if they don't write a book every now and then and print it, get it published, they lose their tenure, their position as a professor. They must produce one book, then another book, then another book. If they don't, finished. In this way they are working all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Marwaris in India, they don't educate their son. Just like Birla. They say, "We can purchase these rascals, why we should waste our time. (laughter) So-called technicians, so-called expert computer, these are... We can purchase, why we shall waste our time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's the same thing I learned in Germany. First I wanted to get my own press and I studied the situation very carefully and I saw it was ridiculous for us to do that, it's so much hard work. It's much easier to collect the money in the street by giving the magazine and then paying someone. They work very hard and do it. Everything is like that. They have so many people that can do everything. The one thing that people can't do is distribute Kṛṣṇa consciousness and for that Kṛṣṇa's giving so much money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore <span class="Italic">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovidaḥ.</span> That verse. Only for this purpose one should endeavor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa (indistinct) paying for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness-you can have money-that you have to cultivate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah, when Mr. Birla is getting old then he has to come to us, if he has any sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No they say, they simply give primary education (indistinct) they can read, that's all. And (indistinct). They don't send because everyone knows that sending boys to the school means spoil them. That's all. I have seen intelligent boys, they go to school and he is spoiled. Yes, spoiled. He learns how to smoke, how to have sex, how to talk nonsense, how to use knife, how to fight, these things. At least at the present moment. Yes. Simply slaughterhouse, this so-called school is called slaughterhouse. Yes, slaughterhouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It was when I went to school-I was a nice little boy-in school I failed out, only (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you must take as intelligent. That so..., time was wasted. Our, this <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> should be taken care of very nicely. So nice preachers may come out. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa,</span> nice <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I'm still thinking about the other morning, we were talking about how everything is actually spirit. Everything is composed of spiritual atoms actually, souls. We were talking about the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vedic version, <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma,</span> everything is Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> When we speak about the transmigration of the soul, we speak about 8,400,000 species. Does that include the inanimate objects as well, within those 8,400,000?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthāvara, sthāvara,</span> they are called <span class="Italic">sthāvara,</span> immovable. He means hills, mountains, stones. They are called <span class="Italic">sthāvara. Sthāvara,</span> which cannot move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So actually we don't really...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati.</span> Two million types of <span class="Italic">sthāvara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So we don't actually discriminate between the tree, and say, the atom, as a living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span> Little by little it's becoming clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthāvara, sthāvara</span> means one cannot move, standing. <span class="Italic">Sthāvara-jaṅgama.</span> There are two kinds of living entities. One moving, one not moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But the atom is always in motion. The atoms and molecules are always constantly moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That movement is different. That is not independent movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is that to say that a stone has a living entity in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Actually what we discussed is that every, even the elements, the atoms, everything is made of nothing but spirit souls in fallen conditions. Because everything comes from <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> which is nothing but spirit souls, and <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti...</span> Therefore soul never changes. So this manifestation is from <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> Therefore, it is made of souls. It is nothing else but spirit souls. Yesterday, a few days ago we discussed that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is simply covered by another energy which is called material energy. And that is <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> means that is not actual, not factual. The example is given, just like the sun is covered by the cloud. The cloud is nothing but another creation of sun. But when the cloud comes, sun is invisible. Similarly this condition, forgetfulness, is my creation and when I am covered by this forgetfulness I become stones and atoms, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it says that the soul is immovable. In the Second Chapter there is a verse that says the soul is immovable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What does that mean exactly? Are we not moving? In that verse it says immovable and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sthāṇu,</span> means fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You mean its nature is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unchangeable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Unchangeable. Not that we are not moving. We are moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Might be that word was not properly used. <span class="Italic">Sthāṇu,</span> the word is <span class="Italic">sthāṇu.</span> If you have got Sanskrit, you know what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">sthāṇu.</span> And <span class="Italic">acalo 'yam, acalo 'yam,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The point of all those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means <span class="Italic">acalo 'yam</span> also, so <span class="Italic">acalo 'yam. Acalo 'yam</span> means that does not move. <span class="Italic">Sthāṇur acalo 'yam,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is given. You can see. Now there is no time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's time for class. (end)</div>
