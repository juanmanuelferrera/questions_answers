<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His father could not. His father could not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> My father couldn't know Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaduvara:</span> Hiraṇyakaśipu. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prahlāda's father, he could not see. But Prahlāda sees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think greatest <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> was Prahlāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I read it, this in this,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So it does not matter whether one is baby or one is a big man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It's just a joke (indistinct) because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, all-powerful God can be anything. God can assume form, God can remain formless. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...by (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vallabhācārya himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is recorded in the court. There was a court case, and it was found that Gopālajī belongs to the Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who, who was pressing the court case?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was amongst themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To see who should get the right to worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Delhi there is a lawyer. He told me. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It would be really wonderful if Sumatiben would decide to support our temple because the entire Gujarati community of Bombay follows her direction. They really do, especially in these matters. And she is known to be the chairman of... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to Patel) You are <span class="Italic">śānta-bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Am I?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śānta, dāsya, sākhya, vātsalya,</span> and <span class="Italic">mādhurya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mādhurya-bhakta</span> is the best. Like <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> But that is very difficult to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, best, it is just one's conception, you see? Otherwise, all are best. All are best. But <span class="Italic">śānta-bhaktas</span> do not take Kṛṣṇa very intimately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) You are... You take me below the belt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">śānta-bhakta</span> means the <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> who appreciates the greatness of the Supreme, but does not take Kṛṣṇa as very intimate. That is <span class="Italic">śānta-bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can, ah, can you imagine God without taking Him very intimately? These are two, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Just like... Intimately... Just like I can give this example, that you have got a great regard for me, but not as intimately as my other disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ah, that is possible. Because I am, I have not put on the order clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This example is, I think, proper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have sacrificed their life for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have got regard for me, but you cannot sacrifice your life for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are trying to tempt me, sir, but I don't think it will be for that. I will not be turned away. I've got my duty to do toward my family. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is, this is the stage of <span class="Italic">śānta-bhakta.</span> I am explaining <span class="Italic">śānta-bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I can understand you. You... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is according to <span class="Italic">śāstra, śānta.</span> There are the different types of mellows, variety mellows. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">śānta, dāsya, sākhya...</span> I do not say that you become my disciple. I don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am your disciple in all respects. I should not put on your, these clothes and come and do all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not our program. That is not our program. We do not ask anyone to change his cloth, never. I never ask them to change his cloth, or change his position. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. We, we always... We always consider a guru in the form of God. God comes to you in the form of a guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That we also accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that is the way I was... I mean, I love you, treat you as such and worship you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And if you think it is any other form, I have no objection, whatever <span class="Italic">bhāva</span> you may call it. What is the matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am speaking on the principle of <span class="Italic">śāstra. śānta-bhakta, dāsya-bhakta, sākhya-bhakta, vātsalya-bhakta, mādhurya-bhakta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, I can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not that <span class="Italic">mādhurya-bhakta</span> is greater than the <span class="Italic">dāsya-bhakta.</span> The example has been given: just like sound. Sound is generated from the ether, sky. You are scientific man. You will understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that sound is existing in all other five elements, four elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sound is not only in the ether, but sound is on the air. The sound is in the fire, the sound is also in the water, and sound is also on the land. So the basic principle of <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa</span> is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All of them. But according to the position, it is more developed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see? In the earth, this sound is very... Just like you take any earthly object, metal. The sound is very strong there. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like water. There is sound. But that sound and metallic sound are different. Sound is there, but the sound of the water and sound of the metal-in the metal the sound is more prominent than in the water. But the sound is there. Similarly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Love is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, love is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But there is more close love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. More developed. Yes. In the <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa,</span> simply this appreciation of the greatness of the Absolute. That is <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Once upon a time the scientists of the world had considered this religion, belief in God to be bosh. Now the scientists have started thinking, and thinking very rightly that there is nothing else but God as you have said. That is the greatest thing that they are doing today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that I am explaining. The sound is there. God consciousness is there, sound as the God consciousness, but in different phases the development is there differently. That is the principle. Everyone has got God consciousness. There is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We come to you, sir, to serve your disciples in the best way we can do because to serve a disciple is to serve God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then, that means it is being developed. That <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa</span> is being developed to <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sometimes disciples don't like our service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are children. They are children. You see, they are coming from foreign countries. They are being trained up. There may be some deficiencies, but this is the scientific progress. When from <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa,</span> one develops <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa,</span> wants to give some service, there is further development. Then further service, not as ordinary service, but as intimate friend. Then, as paternal, then conjugal. These are the different developments. The principle is there, <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa,</span> but they are manifested in different stages of development.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So that, the seed has grown into a small...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...jungle, or whatever you want to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then when it is sprouted, then active service. That is <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is, in the very, I mean, very, the early preaching of all our Vaiṣṇava families...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...that all <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> must be treated very well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> they are on the <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa,</span> as you are. Yes, <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa,</span> appreciating the greatness of the Supreme Absolute Truth. That is <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span> Brahman, Paramātmā. The Brahman feature of the Lord, all-pervading... <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> That appreciation, that is <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span> Paramātmā. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> This is also <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. So this realization of the Absolute Truth is called <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa.</span> And when it is further developed, then <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, these boys must develop friendship with me, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) I am in a way joking sometimes to them and they take me very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Don't take serious. Treat him as your father, or grandfather. He's our great well-wisher, and he's a <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa</span> devotee. Now, I shall request you one thing. The... During <span class="Italic">ārātrika</span> time, hundreds of children come to us. I give little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> You have seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very interested in dance and... Now, I wish that they may be given sumptuous food and dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, dress, I also thought of that. Some of them are very badly dressed, poor people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if they come, "All right, come here. Just take your bath, be cleansed, <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> and a nice dress" and giving them some food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every day they can put on their nice clothes for the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because their father, mother, neither they do know how to take care of the children, but they come to us. We should take care of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is just like those Christian missions, we must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think, I think we must do that. Then we will be able to propagate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not with that purpose. Here is a poor child. He comes automatically to dance. So we should take care of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, I have thought of it long ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We must collect some funds and buy some ready-made clothes, keep them ready and present them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So from <span class="Italic">śānta-rasa</span> we can begin this <span class="Italic">dāsya-rasa.</span> Yes. Instead of taking care of them, you please kindly take up these poor children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, you see, my wife used to take care of more than hundred children in the schools, giving them fees, giving them notes, pencils and clothing and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A little more, little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She was doing it, but I am not she. She was a multi-millionaire's daughter; I am a poor man's son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are not poor man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She had that painting from her young days of her father as a billionaire. But I am a extremely poor man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are the husband of a millionaire's daughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She's dead now. She has got no... She had a grip on me when she was living. I am now a vagabond in her absence. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not the question of you or she. I am just pointing out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no. I will try. I have taken your, this thing to my heart. I will try to collect some fund and get some clothing, those ready-made ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one day a tailors may be brought and take their measurement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But ready-made is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or ready-made. Ready made. So in the evening they should come, they should take bath, be cleansed, and give dress. Next day when they come, change the dress. Let them be habituated. They are coming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In cleanliness, you give them impression of cleanliness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...voluntarily, to dance, to take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So why you should not take care of them? This is my point. We don't make distinction whether they are coming from Christian or Hindu or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no, no, man is a man. I mean those Christians think that we are Hindus and they are Christian. We don't think because in Hinduism or in actually Vedic religion everyone is created one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am in fact, When I go near...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our, our, our <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is <span class="Italic">sarve sukhino bhavantu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhina...</span> Everyone be happy. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We want to see everyone to be happy. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I, but, this is naturally me, if I see, of course... Then naturally... The great Jesus Christ, great <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> of God. (some other men talk in background) But Christians, they have, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. These, they may be low grade. They may be inferior, but if we are superior, we must act as superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Your religion is extremely catholic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our catholic Kṛṣṇa consciousness-Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu. Sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ yāḥ:</span> [Bg. 14.4] "Any form of life, that is, I am the seed-giving father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And how lovingly they come to take little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> I was thinking that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was noticing, myself, the same thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How lovingly they offer me obeisances, touch my feet, and a little fruit or little, whatever I give, they are satisfied. So they are so friendly because they are innocent. They do not know what is this Hindu, Christian. So we must take care of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Some of those childrens are Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind Christian, Hindu, Muslim. A Christian or a..., if we offer them nice food and nice dress, nobody will deny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But these Hindus became Christians because they were offered nice food and dress by Christian missionaries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our point is not that, just to bring them and proselytize them to Hinduism. No. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> take dress, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance. That's all. I never said to all these European and American disciples that "You become a Hindu." I never said. Ask them. I never said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Neither we would have agreed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I ask them to be? I asked them, "Just become lover of God. That's all. If you can love God through your religion, that's all right. You do that." I said that. I never said that "You become Hindu." Then I would not have been able to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think that they must understand, sir, that Hinduism is a way of life and not a religion. Religion is a Vedic religion, which is common to Christianity. I would say that Jesus Christ has taught the Vedic religion to the Middle East and to the heathens and he was crucified because the heathens were not able to understand him properly. That is what my, I mean, convictions, strong conviction is that Jesus had actually preached Hinduism, I mean Vedic religion there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And all religions are in fact Vedic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was educated of his spiritual life in India. Twelve years here. Twelve years he was. And he lived in Jagannātha temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yesterday I found out a very good article. I have preserved it for you. I have forgot to bring it. I'll bring it in the afternoon from Journal, how where he stayed and how he was in India in Himalayas. Some man has made a research. Some Russian scholar has made a research for forty years, in various places and found out from various libraries the all, the old records.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was once a historian report that after crucification he did not die. He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was in <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came in India and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Lived somewhere in Kashmir. That is what I have in article. He lived for a very long time after crucifixion. In crucifixion he went in great <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> and when the cross was brought down, he came out of <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> after three days. That is the resurrection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And then he was brought back by his disciples to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is quite possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is a big community called Issans(?) and Issans are somewhere in between Tigris and that Doab(?), you know, Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. From there he migrated to the Palestine area and preached those fellows all the philosophy that he learned in India. That is... That man has said. So I consider Christianity is a part of..., one of the <span class="Italic">pañca,</span> of Hindu... of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Christianity is Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vaiṣṇavism? Absolutely Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who... Mohammedan is also Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mohammedanism is not Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Caitanya Mahāprabhu had talk with the Pāṭhānas. He proved that "Your religion is Vaiṣṇavism."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Christianity is Vaiṣṇavism 100%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> there is. I have already explained that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, Christianity is 100% Vaiṣṇavism. I have studied Christianity very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not hundred percent, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> More or less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because I have studied the whole of Bible, whole of New Testament and Genesis and everything, very well, just as I have studied the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads.</span> And I have come to realize that Jesus has taught Vedic religion in total, and Christ was nothing but a great saint of ancient Vedic religion. That is my conjecture, my conviction. They (indistinct) may think anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His commandments proved that. He said, "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā,</span> first principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, <span class="Italic">abhayaṁ sattva.</span> First thing is <span class="Italic">abhaya. Abhaya-dāna,</span> when you give, it is the greatest <span class="Italic">dāna.</span> That is the first principle of all the religions, and that is the religion Christ taught there. The Middle East people and the Europeans had no what we call <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> Those people are very backwards, towards India's backside. Because of the climatic conditions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, from the First Commandment it appears that they were not very enlightened because why does he say "Thou shall not kill"? That means they were killers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They were killing. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were killers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Otherwise, they would not have said, "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the first commandment is there, "Thou shall not kill"? They were fighting and killing amongst themselves. Not very advanced nation. And he was horrified when he saw that the Jews were killing animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the temple.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is professional... It is not very. So everyone takes bribe and everyone is interested in money than anything. That is not very great fault. You see. When you are in the material world, you require money. That is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They were not able to understand that he is going to raise another temple. Another temple, that is how the Jews, were against him. I think... That is what my conjection, no? Another temple means another creed of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is "against" or "for," this so-called "against" or "for," it has no meaning. Just like children fight, sometimes against, sometimes for. So it has no meaning. Unless one is raised in the spiritual consciousness, this so-called goodness and badness has no meaning. <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta kara</span> says, <span class="Italic">dvaite bhadrābhadra sakali samāna:</span> "In the material atmosphere, the so-called goodness and so-called badness, they're all the same, simply a different type of mental concoction. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If nothing but God exists, then bad thing is also God and good thing is also God. That that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore God realization is real good thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Real good thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not this, "This is good, this is bad." That is relative world. You'll find everywhere something good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Good and bad are the <span class="Italic">bhukti-yoga citta</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then you make <span class="Italic">citta-bhukti nirodha</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">yoga,</span> and that <span class="Italic">nirodha,</span> yoga, again that vacuum should not be allowed to be formed, but it should be filled with the, with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are becoming ex-community?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am... No. That is not... There is only one community and that is also many people. All of us one. The animal communities are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is also another community. If you take simply humanity, that is another community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then all communities are including...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should neglect the animal community?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Extremely scholastic they have become afterwards. Even though they have not gone to the school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Jīva Gosvāmī. Jīva Gosvāmī, there is no comparison of learned scholarship with him throughout the whole world. He's such a <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> Even great, great <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> said that "There will be no more such learned philosopher, neither there was, like Jīva Gosvāmī."

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in our <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya-vaiṣṇava-sampradāya</span> there are so many learned scholars. Just like my Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But a Sanskrit... I tell you, the Bengalis are the great scholars all round, in all respects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And we are your followers, Gujaratis. In fact, in India, next to Bengal comes Gujarati in scholarship. And Maharashtra first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, your Gokule said, "What Bengal thinks today, others will think tomorrow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. Even in <span class="Italic">Mara-mari</span> (?) also, you think only... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually, this independence movement was started from Bengal. Partition of Bengal and the movement started, Surendranath Bannerjee. Gandhi admitted, "Father of nation is Surendranath Bannerjee." Yes. And later on, actually, if you don't take other, the independence came through a Bengali, Subash Chandra Bose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not even... Philosophy also. Gaurapāda,(?) the grandson of Śaṅkarapāda. Gaurapāda, Gaurapāda was, he's Govindapāda and Govindapāda is Śaṅkarācārya. So that also you will see that some Śaṅkara's greatest sire was a Bengali gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now taking too much, too much taking in political part. Aurobindo, Aurobindo, he was a politician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Great politician. He was a humanist also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but he left. "This is no good." I must take to yoga practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No man can become like an Aurobindo again. Very great man. A politician, a saint, and what not.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Aurobindo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rushi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> A modern <span class="Italic">rushi.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Rushi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">ṛṣi,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You call it <span class="Italic">"ṛṣi"</span> and we call it <span class="Italic">"rushi.</span>" that is the difference in pronunciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like the Oriyas. they call "Krushna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Krushna," yes. They cannot even say Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot say, "Kṛṣṇa;" they say, "Krushna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We call, "Kreshna." We call "Kreshna," you call, "Kṛṣṇa," they call, "Krushna." These are different... We call, <span class="Italic">"rushi."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bhāva-grāhi janārdana.</span> But Kṛṣṇa can understand who is asking for Him. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All languages He understands. All languages are from <span class="Italic">oṁ,</span> and <span class="Italic">oṁ</span> is God. So all languages are God. Look at my arguments. Am I right or wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are wrong? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">oṁkāra sarva-vedeṣu:"</span> I am <span class="Italic">oṁkāra sarva-vedeṣu.</span>" [break] ...mental concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Is a body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who has got this material body, he is not well. He may be possessing very stout and strong body, but he's not well. Because death is there. So well or no well, you have to meet death. So where is, where is the use of your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is this death? If you say, "You meet death," then you are a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, no, no. I am speaking... I am answering your "well" and "not well." That's it. When there is death, then what is the use of calling "well" and "not well"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "Well" and "not well," that's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my point. If you can avoid death, disease, old age, then you are well. You cannot avoid all these things. You must become old man, you must die, you must be diseased; where is the meaning of this well? It is simply concoction. [break] Where is happiness? Where is well-being? That they do not know. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. That they do not know. Just like a man lying on sick bed, and some friends come, "How are you?" "Yes, today I am well." What is this "well"? You are lying on the sick bed, hospital, and you are speaking, "Yes, I am well." (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> There is no "well." So long you are subjected to birth, death, old age and disease, there is no question of "well." When you can avoid these things, then you are well. [break] ...but our independence. What is that independence? No rice, no <span class="Italic">geha.</span> What is this independence? [break] (Hindi) "godless civilization" <span class="Italic">saba boka mare hai, bās.</span> [break] ...take shelter of Kṛṣṇa, everything is false. You cannot escape. (Hindi) The death is there. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">].</span> So at the end everything will be taken away by Kṛṣṇa in the form of death. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham.</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Everyone, especially the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they think that they will live forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the most wonderful thing. Because everyone is dying, but the man who is not yet dead, he thinks that he'll live forever. This is the most wonderful thing. <span class="Italic">Ahanyāhanya lokāni gacchanti yama-mandiram, śeṣaḥ sthitam icchanti kim āścaryam atha param</span> (?). He does not think that "I'll have to die. So what I am doing?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, may I ask one question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You said this population is increasing. According to Hindu theory, we say that human life is very difficult and you get this human birth after great <span class="Italic">karmas</span> and good deeds and all that. So this population is increasing and we are putting the birth control; and then the population of beasts and others that, the wild beasts, that is decreasing, although almost it has decreased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have no birth control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, just see. And then you see the population of these, for instance, chickens, pigs, and those, they have increased. So the population of human being that is increasing, is it due to these wild animals and other they have done good deeds, so they are coming up as a human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing is, I am asking you, why you are bothering about the increase of population? First, that is my question. The animals, they do not bother. You are so advanced in knowledge. Why you are bothering? First of all answer this question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, but that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The animals, they have got less intelligence. They never bother themselves, "The population is increasing." And you are advanced animal. Why you are so much bothered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are less intelligent than the animals. That is my argument. They are lower animals. They are begetting at one time one dozen children. They are not bothering. Why you are bothering? That means that you are less than the animals. Because you have got so much anxiety, "Why population increasing?" But they are not bothering. So you are less than animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, my question is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my answer. Why you are bothering the population increasing? Why you are bothering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because they think that the resources...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Some, there is some... There is some reason. But they have no such thing. So therefore they are advanced. They have no such anxiety. You are less than animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that's right Swamiji, but what my question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... First answer is this, that you are bothered for increased population, but the animals are not. Therefore they are more advanced than you. They know that there is no botheration. Because in the Vedic injunction it is said, <span class="Italic">eko yo bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Now, there are millions of elephants in Africa. Who is feeding them? Who is feeding them? They eat at one time one mound. Where the food is coming from? Why you are bothered? You'll take only one <span class="Italic">chaṭāka.</span> That means you are godless. You do not know who is supplying your food. You are less than animal. That is my answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, my question is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is answer. You are very much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi) Human being, they are all coming as.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Human being, that is a chance given to you to become human being, to understand God. And if you do not place yourself as human being, you must suffer. Just like (Hindi). <span class="Italic">Ācchā</span> post. If you do not behave rightly, you are degraded. You are going to animal become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, but,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this is the nature's law. This is the nature's law, that some way or other, by evolutionary process, you come to the human being form, but if you remain as animal, then you go to animal again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So animal <span class="Italic">me āpne bolte hai</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">He.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> So if population increase...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same example. Suppose by promotion, you come to a very nice post, but if you do not behave well, then you are degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that I agree, Swamiji, <span class="Italic">ke admi yo he, karenge</span> (?), they will go back as human beings. But (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, <span class="Italic">bhāla</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, why, why don't you understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> Chance is given to you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...there is human form of life. If you do not know, then you remain animal. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca samānam etad paśubhiḥ narāṇām:</span> "Eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse, and defense-this is there in the animals." And if you remain in that jurisdiction only-eating, sleeping and sexual intercourse and defense-you are animal, no more than animal. Why you are thinking that you are more than animal? You are animal. This is the śāstric injunction. You are no better than animal because your business is eating, sleeping, sexual intercourse and defense. Whole world is busy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And then, Swamiji, this birth control, that means going against the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are more than animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no, that just means going against the will of the God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because God wants to bring them as human...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is a chance. Suppose if somebody's given chance to take opportunity and if you kill, that's a great sin. You cannot do that. You are obstructing his natural progress. Is that birth control (Hindi) European countries <span class="Italic">mai</span> (?), he hasn't got soul, lump of matter, (Hindi) [break] As soon as you forget the duty of human life, then you are nothing but animal. This is the verdict of Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> that if you do not properly behave as human being, you are no better than animal. <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa hīna,</span> (Hindi) ...will give him an animal body. This is nature's work. Yes, again come, again come (Hindi) But he does not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But Swamiji, sexual intercourse after marriage is against law of Manu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is also... There is law. You cannot have sexual intercourse with wife as you like, no. That is also illicit sex. Then... When the woman is in menstrual period, after five days, you can have once. As soon as she is pregnant, no more sexual intercourse. This is human being. Not that like animal. Animals also, they have got restrictions. You see? The lions, they have sexual intercourse once in life. Once in life. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī.</span> You see? So as soon as you violate the laws, then you are animal. Because law is meant for man. Just like "Keep to the right" and "left" in the road. It is meant for human being, not for the dogs. Dog, if he keeps right or left, it is not under law. But if you keep your car instead of left to the right, then you are criminal. (pause) So which way we have to go?... Human life begins when he understands what is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> That is human life, beginning. <span class="Italic">Aushikha</span> (?) (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Jaiye aur</span> Hindu religion <span class="Italic">hai,</span> Muslim religion <span class="Italic">hai,</span> Christian religion <span class="Italic">hai,</span> Buddhist religion <span class="Italic">hai,</span> Jewish religion <span class="Italic">hai.</span> The religion must be there. But when we give up this religious process, then there is no more human life; it is animal life. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So by that, there's a emblem of the theosophical colony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see. Oh, yes, yes. [break] One old lady... You know, in the villages there is fair, or market. So in the morning she saw that so many hundreds of men have assembled. So one lady of that village, she thought that "They have become my guests." So she began to cry and was asking his son, her son, "Oh, how I can accommodate so many people? How can I receive them as guests?" So the son said, "My dear mother, don't be agitated. In the evening you come." So in the evening when she come, there was nobody. There was nobody, because a marketplace. So this botheration is just like the old lady. After seeing so many men, she is agitated. And in the evening there is none. So it requires intelligence, that "They are coming and going. Why I should be bothered about that? Let me do my duty as human being." That is required. (Hindi:) <span class="Italic">Ek sat me dekhila.</span> [break] ...unlimited number of living entities. <span class="Italic">Ananta. Ananta</span> means you cannot count. Within your body, within your stool, there are millions of living entities. They are provided, maintained, by your stool, by your urine. So why do you bother? If your stool and urine can provide so many living entities, why you bother yourself? (Hindi) You do your duty as human being. <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa hīna paśubhiḥ sa...</span> Don't become animal. That is required. (Hindi) [break] ...the essence of knowledge. People are diverted in so many ways. Human duty is... (Hindi) [break] That is human duty. Be surrendered to God. That is your duty. Then everything will come automatically. Everything will come. And without knowledge, how you can take care? That is not possible.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Sar:</span> All these movements at one time, sometimes <span class="Italic">Ārya-samāja</span> movement was very strong, sometimes another's. They come and go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this Kṛṣṇa movement is always strong. There are millions of Kṛṣṇa temples in India, and the <span class="Italic">Ārya-samājīs</span> tried to check people going to the temple, but they, they have gone away, and the temple is existing and millions of people still going to see the temple. In Jagannātha temple, in Vṛndāvana, thousands and thousands of men, still coming. All the South Indian temples.</div>
