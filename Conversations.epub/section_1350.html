<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's sort of encouraging to see you taking milk. That's encouraging. That's something which you said if you could take, you would get stronger, so I'm encouraged by that. I think that a great deal of patience is ultimately required. We have to expect that actual strength and muscles will take a little time to come. (background conversation) (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, that will go away. (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are taking urine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you didn't pass any urine the first time. Do you want to try again? We can cleanse you now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) (Bengali conversation with Bon Mahārāja)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a certificate arrived from the Soviet Union.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> It's in Russian language or in English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, some of it, I think, is in Russian. I have the translation. It says, the top wording here, this says that "Books in the service of peace and progress. A diploma for the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Bombay, given by the First Moscow International Book Fair Exhibitions and Fairs, General Directorate of International Book Exhibitions and Fairs, USSR." (Bengali conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All Russian universities ordered Prabhupāda's books. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> (Bengali) (Bengali conversation with Prabhupāda) That's <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Tenth Canto. That is up to which chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Twelve chapters. This is up to chapter twelve. And now thirteenth chapter is also completed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> In and out, both are superexcellent. Inside, in Mahārāja's translation, and outside, your publication, printing, makeup, everything superexcellent. That is first attraction, when you take the book in your hand you feel that is something very nicely done. I don't think in India we can have this type of printing. You get them printed now in Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They're printed in Tennessee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Tennessee. And the pictures are printed separately, then the pictures are sent to the publisher in pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Last time they told me in New York... Your press was in New York, and they were shifting it to Los Angeles. About two hundred <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> were working there and they told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it's in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Los Angeles. Well, it is all Mahāprabhu's will, and Prabhupāda is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Los Angeles is <span class="Italic">godown...</span> (Bengali) Howrah Station. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have a picture of it, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I have a picture of that BBT <span class="Italic">godown.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Show him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's about two blocks long and about one block high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Everything is done in a very big way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> 'Cause Prabhupāda's a big (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) (Bengali conversation with Bon Mahārāja)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's a picture of that book <span class="Italic">godown</span> in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> What's the length of the building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the length of that building, Jayādvaita? Twenty thousand square feet in area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> In area. Well, in your country, in USA, everything is very big. Nothing is done in a small way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the Los Angeles temple. These are the Deities, Śrī-Śrī-Rukmiṇī-Dvārakādhīśa. And we have a very nice doll exhibition there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> What is that exhibition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Doll, diorama. These are some of the exhibitions. This devotee here, Bharadvāja dāsa, he's the creator of this doll exhibition. This is our temple in New York now, this building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> You have purchased it? There was a talk of taking that twelve-story theological seminary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is also thirteen stories, but it's a different building. It's in Manhattan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Which street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty-fifth Street. This is our temple in London. We have actually three temples there now. This one is in Hertfordshire, called Bhaktivedanta Manor, and then we have one near the British Museum in Bury Place, which is that five-story building. And then we just purchased a restaurant and reading room just off of Oxford St., on Soho St. This is in France. It's a chateau which we have purchased, very nice, with a farm. Very beautiful place. And these are the Deities, Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya, in Fiji. This temple was just opened in Fiji. Kṛṣṇa-Kāliya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bon Mahārāja:</span> Kāliya-damana. That is in Fiji. (Bengali with Prabhupāda)</div>
