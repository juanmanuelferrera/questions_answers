<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Because it went on so long, we didn't stop. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Utilize His mercy. Then your life is perfect. He is ready to help you, from within and from without. Kṛṣṇa is so kind. The kindness, the mercifulness of Kṛṣṇa, nobody can repay. In every birth, He is with me, canvassing: "Why you are acting whimsically? Just turn towards Me." Therefore He's going along with the living entity in every kind of body, either as demigod's body or hog's body, still, Kṛṣṇa is there. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭhaḥ</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> (pause) Give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They said it would be coming any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They're bringing some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any other paper? No, it is a very impressive picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> It's wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they have given, "A Rival for Nelson." So this movement is a rival... Days were there in British Empire that Nelson was a hero. Now Kṛṣṇa is going to be hero in this country. (laughter) It is a good admission, "A Rival for Nelson." Actually, He should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Now no one even remembers Nelson.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I never heard of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Nelson, he fought the Spanish battle, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He died, but became victorious. Yes. I think during Queen, last Elizabeth's time, or something...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes. The last words: "England expects that every man this day will do his duty." And all that. He was a hero because he died young, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. I do not know. But Nelson, Lord Nelson, was famous man, soldier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Now the pigeons are sitting on his head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I have just come from Morocco. I've been with the King of Morocco, who is... It's very strange because he is an absolute ruler, and when an ordinary man is an absolute ruler, it's rather dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If the man is really Kṛṣṇa's representative, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Is he a pious man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, he prays five times a day. He's a Moslem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That king should be a representative of God. That is ideal king. But if he thinks that "This kingdom is my property, and let me enjoy for my sense enjoyment," then it is all gone. If he thinks himself as representative of God... Just like we think. Therefore we are after our disciples: "Do this, do that, do that, do that." We want to see that my disciples also become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Similarly, it is the king's duty to see that every citizen becomes God conscious. Then he is representative of God. That is the first duty. The division must be there, and the, it is the duty of the king to see that everyone is discharging according to his responsibility. That is king's duty. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is acting exactly like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> The <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> is acting exactly like <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> A <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> is... Like that. It is the duty of a king to see that nobody's unemployed, everyone is engaged in his own occupational duty. That is the... And they must feel security of life, property, anxiety. That is perfect king. Here, at the present moment, nobody is confident whether he'll live after an hour or... You see. Anyone can take your property and life, at any moment. There is no protection. There is no protection. And so far anxiety, there is no length and breadth. People are always full of anxieties. Unemployment. These things should not be there. No unemployment, no anxiety, no feelings of insecurity. And that is good government. Nowadays there are police force. But what is the use of this police force? You go on the street, somebody stabs you, what police can do? If somebody takes away your money from your personal pocket, what the police can do? They'll take some note.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That's right. If ...one boy who stole from us, I told the police. We told them exactly where he was, at the airport, Manchester. "He's going on flight such and such to America tomorrow." Plenty of time to apprehend him. They didn't do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They came... Oh, they sent one inspector to take notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Many notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless, all... And taxation. No security and ninety-nine per cent taxation. Just see the fun. They are very much accurate to take taxation. And there is no guarantee of security. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Has it ever been perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Has it ever been on earth in the material world perfect with...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> It has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five thousand years ago, it was all perfect. The whole world, this planet, was being ruled by one king. And they were all happy. That is in the history. Five thousand years ago. Maybe less, in three thousand years ago the history was different. The difficulty is that as soon as one is lost of his culture, he becomes an animal. <span class="Italic">Dharmeṇa hīnāḥ paśubhiḥ samānāḥ.</span> That is the difference between human being and animal. Human being must be with culture. Animal cannot be cultured. So a human being without culture, he's no better than animal. That culture is lost. They have missed the aim of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They think they have culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this culture? A human being is killing so many animals, innocent animals, is that culture? They are less than animals. Who kills? The tiger kills, ferocious. A human being killing innocent animals... In Christian religion, therefore: "Thou shall not kill." But they are killing only. Where is the culture? Killing culture. That is not culture. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> It must be so. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How a human being can kill another human being or another animal unnecessarily? And if you kill, there is law, life for life. But they have made laws for human beings. When an animal is killed, he's not criminal. But in the God laws you cannot avoid that. If you have killed an ant, you must be shot. That is God's law. You can avoid man-made law, but you cannot avoid God-made law. That you cannot do. You must be responsible. If you kill an ant even without knowledge, you are responsible. Such subtle laws are there. So we must know our responsibility. Without knowledge, if we kill, we are responsible. And with knowledge, there is no question. Where is that culture? They advertise, "Live and let live." What is that? Do they do that? Actually? They want to live at the expense of others. Why not let live others? Where is that culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Now there is a famous cinema being shown called "Live and Let Die."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good culture. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Favorite. Everyone likes it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Let others die; you live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And yet, Arjuna had to fight in the war, didn't he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he still had to... But it didn't matter him killing if it was Kṛṣṇa's responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Fighting or killing, when it is done for, under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa, that is a different thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a soldier fights on behalf of the king, and the more he kills, he gets medal. The same soldier, as soon as kills one man, he's hanged. He cannot say, the soldier, that "In the battlefield I killed hundreds and hundreds men and I was rewarded. Now I have killed only one man, I am being hanged? What is this?" Why? He's hanged. Because he killed on his own account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> There's the thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in the battlefield he killed on the state's account. He was rewarded. So there is difference between killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there is real, righteous fight, for good cause, that fighting is all right. Just like the state gives punishment one person, "This man should be hanged. Kill him." So who is blaming the state, "Oh, the state is killing this man?" That is right. It is good for him. In <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> there is good background. So similarly, everything is good when it is done for the good. And God is good. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious move... And everything is bad when it is done for <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That's all. So these wars are declared not for Kṛṣṇa's sake; by the politicians' whims. So they must be responsible for this war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Like the Vietnam, you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any, any war. They create whimsical... Anything you do whimsically, you are responsible. Anything you do. Why fighting? Anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. It's funny that that John F. Kennedy, he started that Vietnam war, and he was shot down later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He started that war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the position now? Nixon? He's going to be impeached? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Practically, he is, without...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's cornered now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. He's lost all respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prestige. Still if he sticks to his position, that is his foolishness. He should have resigned. If, if... Upright man: "All right, you do not like me. I resign." Then whole thing would have been quashed off. But he's a foolish man. He's sticking to his position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasādam</span> will be here in a few minutes. Our position, I guess, is just to make it an easy choice for people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> To come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But choice means, a child cannot be given for choice. He must be forced. Right child is a rascal. So you cannot give him choice. He must do it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Or like, like our festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> To make it easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice. It is, what is called, nonviolent. We ask everyone, "Come and join." You saw our procession yesterday?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> No, I didn't. I wasn't there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see. Many thousand people joined us. From two o'clock up to eight o'clock. Six hours. At last, the police had to ask them to go away. Is it not? Who told me that? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> I didn't know. I know they were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were not leaving Trafalgar Square. So it is a very nice movement, very serious movement. You are known to so many big, big men. Try to induce them to understand this serious movement. If leading takes something seriously, others follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. At the present moment, the world situation is not very good. And it will deteriorate more and more if they do not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness or God consciousness. When I speak "Kṛṣṇa," that means God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your idea of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> It seems... I, I mean I, I don't know. I've thought of it, of course, many times as every intelligent person has, but it's, my idea of God is on the consciousness of the whole world, of all that we could possibly envisage, its consciousness is, that's God, and we're the little bits of it. But would you tell me...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Complete in everything. That is the conception of God. Complete in power, complete in knowledge, complete in beauty, complete in opulence... Everything complete. That is the conception of God. Everything complete. There is no scarcity. Everything complete, unlimited. So what is your idea of this material creation? Material means so much land, so much water, so much air, so much fire. So who created these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Well, God created it, and it seems to be the aspect of God that we are attached to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> (laughs) But I'd rather you told me, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> This material world is like an aspect of God that we are attached to, but the God behind we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our foolishness, that we do not know that behind this material cosmic manifestation, there is God. That information we get from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> That means this cosmic manifestation is creation of God. The vast water is created by God. The vast land is created by God. Everything is created by God. Do you believe that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. So if everything is created by God, then, when you create something, is it your property or God's property?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Oh, God's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes. But it feels like it when one creates it. One's surprised and didn't know what it was going to be like and cannot claim it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God supplies the ingredients. That just like you are working on stone. So who has supplied the stone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, this I can understand because it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then you are working on the stone with your intelligence, but who has supplied you the intelligence? You are working with your hand, but who has supplied you the hand? In this way, if we consider that everything belongs to God; therefore the result must be given to God. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Sometimes one gets in the way. Sometimes one, when one's own wishes intrude, one can spoil what's being made by trying to put one's own ideas at the wrong time. But at other times, even with somebody who's as bad at it as me, the, something else does come through, doesn't it? The, the, what should be there if one senses and stands back and lets it come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Sometimes it is not successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> When we try artificially to impose our idea on something, say, a sculpture, sometimes we make a mistake and it comes out not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That mistake you are responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because at the present moment, as I told you, we are acting according to our whims. So if there is mistake, I am responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> In, in,... Sometimes they call inspiration... They say, "Oh, I've been inspired," and they create something beautiful by, automatically almost. What is that inspiration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That inspiration means you created an idea, that "I want to do like that," and because you are persistent to act, so God helps you, "All right, you act." That is inspiration. But you are responsible. God gives you... You are persistent, that "I must have it." "All right, do it." That is inspiration. We should not do that. Unless it is desired by God, we should not act anything. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam, ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam... Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> You should not have any (indistinct) for your satisfaction. Then it is all God's responsibility. <span class="Italic">Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What if there's some desire to make something beautiful to give to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> If one wants to be ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Kṛṣṇa will accept not from any ordinary man, unless you are devotee. If you think that "I shall do something for Kṛṣṇa without having any relationship with Kṛṣṇa," how Kṛṣṇa will accept it? Kṛṣṇa accepts only from the devotee. He does not accept anything from anyone else. He's not in want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, exactly. (laughs mildly)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not in want. He's complete in Himself. But when a devotee gives Him love and faith, He accepts: "All right. Thank you." That is another thing. Otherwise, He doesn't require anything from him. What beautiful thing you can give to Kṛṣṇa? He can create thousand times beautiful thing than you... What power you have got? Why should you desire like that? But if you are devotee, either it is beautiful or ugly, it doesn't matter. If you give to Kṛṣṇa in good faith, He'll accept it. It doesn't matter. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He doesn't require anything. But <span class="Italic">bhaktyā,</span> in devotion and love, if anyone offers even a little leaf, a little flower, <span class="Italic">tad aham aśnāmi,</span> "I accept." He says. A little flower and little leaf, what benefit you'll do to Kṛṣṇa, unlimited? But He says, "Still, I accept because it is offered in faith and devotion." So that is a different thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's funny, too. When David went to see the Queen one day, he took fifteen of our small rubies. They're not worth much compared to her crown jewels...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> But he told her that they were like... She said, "Well, what shall I do with them?" And he said, "Well, they are... Consider them, Your Majesty, like flowers offered to you by one of your subjects." And she became very pleased to see it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What, what is the value of those jewels to her? But if some citizen offers in good faith and love, she accepts. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Is it right thinking to think that one, although one can't give anything... Kṛṣṇa, of course, has everything. Should one not praise Him? Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You should praise Him, certainly. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Because what I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> (People enter room, pause, moving tables, etc.) Take <span class="Italic">prasādam. Prasādaṁ prāpti-mātreṇa bhoktavyam.</span> (<span class="Italic">"Prasādam</span> should be eaten as soon as one obtains it.") Take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You must be hungry after all that hard work. (Eating, etc.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">halavā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, it's bananas and cream. Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The cream in England is excellent. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if the monarch becomes ideal, it will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> There is still a feeling... In all other countries, everyone thinks, "I can become the leader. I can become president." "I can become prime minister." But in this country, everyone still must think, "I cannot become the king. I cannot become the queen." The king is something higher.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I'm making also the new coins for this country, and they were thinking of leaving off the words "Fin def," which means in Latin "Defender of the faith." And I refused to do it if they left that off the coin. Because it's the most important. It means she's, it acknowledges that she is the, although it's only a tradition, but she's the defender of the faith of the people. And they were going... They said, "Oh, this is just now archaism." But I got them to keep it in. (pause) What I was going to ask was to praise, I feel, and I may be wrong... I was going to ask you. When I make a piece of sculpture of... The other day, I made two dancing figures. They were just a boy and a girl dancing. But I felt that this was praising God because these were as God, I tried to make them, as God had made them, and in joy and simple, but happy. And is this, is this presumptuous, or is this right, to try to praise the creation by making sculpture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Because one sometimes feels that one isn't, doesn't know enough about it to do this, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or better than that is to praise the Creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This sculpting is such a nice art. You're very fortunate to have such a skill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can... (Prabhupāda is eating) Horrible. ...carve so many pastimes of God, Kṛṣṇa's. In India, the sculptor used to do like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Everywhere, all over the world, art's business was to make scenes of..., spiritual scenes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> There's no great art that isn't religious in the world, that isn't to do about God. Because art about man is already debased, isn't it. Yes, must be. But I feel that if one even me, even people like me, the ordinary people making ordinary things, if they're, if it is praising nature... Because nature's an aspect of God, isn't it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And a pure one. Not, not spoiled. Anyway, that's what I tell myself. (laughs) What I mean is, if one makes a bird, if it has the feeling that because Kṛṣṇa breathed life into it and made it, and if one can reproduce this and get the spirit of it, that's praising...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also indirect praising. But you can praise Him directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think part of the trouble with our modern age is that no one has any information about God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They can't praise Him directly because they don't know what He looks like or what He does. (Prabhupāda is still eating.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this, behind the <span class="Italic">halavā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Behind it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Something is coming out, white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Oh, they probably put cream in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Very good. Thank you. Lovely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how do you like our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> How do I like...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I, I like it, I admire it very much. I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I don't know very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know, you, you, in one day or one minute, how can you know? But our basic principles of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yeah. I've been... I was more or less brought up... My mother told me when I was very small that the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was the most important book in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> So I've always known that it was true, but one, one's knowledge is very shallow. It's always felt true, is what I mean. Because an arti..., you know, a sculptor goes more by feeling than by thinking, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes in your, by your convenience you can come to our temple and see how they are executing devotional...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Hm. Also one can tell a little bit about your teaching by the people one knows who were taught. I know Sam and I know George, and they've changed. George has grown much more, much more than the others. But I knew them when they were very young, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And George now has gained enormously in spiritual steps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a very intelligent boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Oh yes. But he now is wise as well as just clever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And so, from this I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Śyāmasundara has tried his utmost to convince him about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He said, "Other religions... [break] ...come for a short time." (Breaks in tape)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him little, some more <span class="Italic">purīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> No, I'm all right, really. I'm doing very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...and something to wash hands in. (door closes)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's bringing. You can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> David has said that he would like to spend some time, a day or something, making also your form into stone. Is that...? Or into some metal. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, what I am? I am insignificant. I have no objection. Our, some of our artists may paint this picture. I liked it very much. (Probably speaking of picture of Ratha cart in the Guardian newspaper)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It's a very good photo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> It was taken in such a way so that the cart looks like it is almost as tall as Nelson's Column. Fish-eye lens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Very clever person who has thought up this idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No other publication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I didn't see the newspapers today. I saw two or three, but on Sunday the reporters do not work. So if they were reporters coming, they came outside of their work hours. Some... I heard on television last night, though, there was a half hour program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Wasn't it? You saw?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yeah. On the news they had a long sequence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> No, Ranchor said it was very first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Every statement was very positive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What was that word he used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Glorifying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They glorified the whole parade on television. They didn't make fun of it or like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody should make fun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> It wasn't just an objective report, but they said it was good, it was nice, and had good appeal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, everyone appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> The last thing they said on the program was, "Perhaps this will give us something to think about for a long time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> It must.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No one could deny. They had never seen such a colorful parade, so full of festivity. (Someone walks up to Prabhupāda.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I could have gone there. All right. (Sound of washing hands in bowl.) Yes. So I am very glad that you have come and you have taken <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Thank you, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we had very good talks also. I'm very glad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I'm hoping George will come tomorrow. He has indicated he would come Tuesday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is basin. You can wash your hands. Wash the dishes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Even at night the sun is shining still. Or rather, the day is night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here. There is basin. You can wash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I am eating more here. (laughter) Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span>. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I could not eat, in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Apparently, it's not causing any trouble either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means I must have improved. Otherwise, how I am eating? I could not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No hunger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No hunger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> India is so hot. It's so hot there you don't want to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Bothersome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It was a nice talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Sublime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The subject matter is sublime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This boy that you were talking to this afternoon is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now everything is finished. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Now he must stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's going around to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Would you like to wash your hands, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got. Now you can distribute amongst yourselves. They have been...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This is a nice book, <span class="Italic">Upadeśāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, it's very nice. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> If one tries to praise the Creator by, directly, with his ability, what, how does he know what to...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many standard prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> By his work, I mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. To glorify God means the glorify the nature also. Just like here is a poem in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁ...</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-<br class="calibre2"/>koṭisv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam<br class="calibre2"/>tad brahma niṣkalam anantam aśeṣa-bhūtaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.40]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Now, the whole creation is there. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavataḥ [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> On account of the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, which is called <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti...</span> Just like on account of the sunshine, the whole universe is existing. So similarly, there is a shine, bodily shining, what is called <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti.</span> So when the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is there, then innumerable universes are created. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavataḥ [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the effulgence, <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> is there, innumerable universes are created. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi. Jagad-aṇḍa</span> means universe. <span class="Italic">Koṭi,</span> innumerable. <span class="Italic">Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭisv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> And in each universe is created with innumerable number of planets. And each planet has got different atmosphere. Now the whole universe is described. <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **. Yasya prabhā.</span> The beginning: "Whose effulgence has created." That means simultaneously you praise His creation; at the same time, you get the universal knowledge how many universes are there, how they are situated, what is the atmosphere, everything. You get a glimpse of idea at the same time. <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> This is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So we see in the creation of God, it also traces back to the Creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Creation means the Creator. Just like when I see the picture of so many sculptor. So who has done it? I come to David. To appreciate the creation means you have to come to the point, appreciating the Creator. Otherwise, it is not finished. Or your knowledge is imperfect still. So these scientists, they are simply trying to study the creation. They have no knowledge about the Creator. That is the defect. Neither do they try, neither they can understand. They are so foolish and poor fund of knowledge. They should try to understand the Creator also. Then the knowledge is perfect. Just like the scientists, they are theorizing that life began from matter, chemicals. But wherefrom the chemicals came? That is insufficient knowledge. They say, "Chemicals existed." Now, we have no such experience... Just like we ate some <span class="Italic">purīs. Purīs</span> had to be created. Not that existed. It is existing, but when I require, I have to create it. The crude example. The chemicals, wherefrom the chemicals came? That is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> In this way you have to study. Simply to study the creation, that is imperfect knowledge. When you come to the Creator, then it is perfect. Just like if you see simply his sculptures, so many things, that is not perfect knowledge. Why this book is "David Wynne"? Now, you go to the creator. And ...the all appreciation is there, credit is given there. That is perfect. Otherwise, you see, so many stones are there, figures are there. But when you study that "This is the creation of such and such artist, sculptor, and he's such and such," then that is perfect. Study him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Just like by my knowing David, it's very easy to understand his sculpture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> But someone who's just seeing his sculpture, they don't know what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They don't know what he's like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is not perfect knowledge. Perfect knowledge is when you understand the creator. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> I think yes. I'm not sure that the analogy..., I think that the greatest... Well, it is true because with the greatest sculpture, one does get to the full understanding, but if one really understands the universe, well, one would see God, I suppose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to penetrate. You have to understand who has created this universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes. Yes. But if a great artist was no longer alive, people would still appreciate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but the God is not like that, no longer alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> No, but that's what I mean. The analogy falls down there, doesn't it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> But you're saying that it's better to first penetrate and understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Then understand the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Before understanding, trying to understand God by His universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> And science almost denies the existence of God in order to exist, doesn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a rascal. These rascals say like that. Anyone who denies the existence of God, he is rascal number one. Immediately. And anyone, he may be a great scientist or philosopher, let him come. If he says that "I don't believe in God," then I shall prove that "You are rascal number one." That I shall prove.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We'll bring you some scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So many scientists, psychologists, philosophers came to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> But the greatest scientists have..., are the humblest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real knowledge, when one becomes humbler: "Oh, God is so great." That is real scientist. I think Professor Einstein, he admitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> Yes, he said that "I want to know how God created the universe. Everything else is details."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that means he's still thinking, "My knowledge is imperfect because I do not know about God." That is real scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Just studying one small part of God's creation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...is, is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see how nicely God has created this flower. How nice artist he is, how he has put the color exactly to the same point. So there is no hand? This is foolishness. It is going on. There is hand of God, but how His hand is working we do not know. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Vedas: parāsya śaktir vividhaiva śrūyate [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> He has got so subtle power that it is working, but we are seeing that it is automatically being done. But He's working. He's working. Just like we work. To paint one flower, we require a brush, color and so many things. Similarly He also requires. But His requirement are supplied so quickly that we see, "It is being automatically done." That is the... Because He's so perfect and unlimited that His working capacity we cannot follow. These are explained in the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> that God has no leg, but He can go so fast that nobody can compete with Him. These are the statements the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> that He goes so fast that nobody can compete with Him, nobody can go with Him. That is God's energy. So when it is said, "God has no leg," that means He has no this imperfect leg. He has go..., He has got so perfect leg that nobody can walk with Him. This is the idea. Not that God has no leg. He has got leg, but not this rascal leg. After walking three miles, that's all, finished. (laughter) Not like that. Not like that. <span class="Italic">Paśyaty acakṣuḥ.</span> He sees, but he has no eyes. These are the statements in the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> He has no eyes... Just like we have got eyes, but we cannot see beyond this wall. But He can see everyone's heart, what he is thinking, what he is doing, everything. You cannot hide anything from His seeing. <span class="Italic">Paśyati.</span> That is, that is His seeing. <span class="Italic">Paśyaty acakṣuḥ.</span> As soon as we hear something "seeing," immediately understand the relative term that one must have eyes to see. Then when the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says <span class="Italic">acakṣuḥ,</span> immediately warns that "Don't think God has got eyes like you." Because as soon as we think of eyes, we think of our eyes. We cannot think that there can be eyes which can penetrate everywhere. We cannot think of that. And therefore they become impersonalists. Because we rascals, when we think of God's personality, we think of our personality. "So we are imperfect. Therefore, how God can be person? He must be just opposite." Imperfect knowledge. They cannot think, these impersonalists, that God is person but all His bodily construction is perfect, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ. Īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That Him they cannot think. That means poor fund of knowledge. The impersonalist cannot think that having eyes, how one can see everything all at a time, past, present and future. But that is impossible by us because we have got imperfect eyes. Therefore they conclude, "No eyes. He must be without eyes." Imperfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So if God is a person with eyes, legs, He stays in one place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again, the same... You are comparing with yourself. Because your person can stay in one place only. That means you are simply comparing the Personality of Godhead with your personality. That you have to forget. He, He stays everywhere. <span class="Italic">Goloka eva nivasaty akhilātma-bhūtaḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore we have to consult the authoritative Vedic literature. This answer is there, that <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty,</span> "He is living in Goloka Vṛndāvana; still, He is everywhere." You cannot think of. You are in this apartment. You are not in your office. But Kṛṣṇa, although He's in Goloka Vṛndāvana, He's everywhere, in everyone's heart. He's seeing everything. That you cannot imagine, how it is possible. That means you want to compare with your, this foolish, imperfect personality with God's personality. That is our defect. He's distinct from our personality, but He's a person. Yes. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> He's also a person like us, He's also living entity like us. But what is the difference? He's the maintainer; we are maintained. How many persons you can maintain? A family of two children and one wife, you are embarrassed. And He's maintaining everyone. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti...</span> Innumerable living entities, He's supplying food everyone. He's supplying food the ants within the hole of your room there are thousands of ants. You are not supplying food. How they are getting food? Similarly, you go to the African jungle. There are thousands and millions of elephants. They eat one at a, oh, huge quantity. He's giving food. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> In the air, within the water, there are so many living entities. In the air there are so many living entities. On the land there are so many living entities. Everywhere. How He's feeding? That is the distinction between God's personality and our personality. We are embarrassed to maintain a family of four, five members, and He is maintaining the whole family of living entities. Not only one planet, there are innumerable planets. And not only innumerable planets, the one universe, then innumerable universes. And these, all these taken together, this is one-fourth creation of God. So three-fourth creation is of the spiritual world. Just imagine how big it is. All of them being maintained by that one. This is the difference. (Someone comes in). Come on. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> This is the distinction. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Haribol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can, at any time, visit our temple. You can understand, try to understand the conception of God. We shall try to explain. But we can, at least, so far our knowledge is concerned, we have got a clear conception of God, what is meant by God. Therefore we do not accept the so-called dogs as God. No. So many people come: "I am God. I am God." We kick on their face. We don't accept. We don't accept such cheap gods. God is one, and He's all-powerful. That is our conception. We all servants of God. If anyone says that "I am servant of God," he's welcome. He's my master. The servant of God is my master. And if anyone claims to become God, I kick on his face. This is our principle. Because he's pretender, cheater. He should be punished immediately. So you, there are other papers also, published? You have seen? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Are there any papers, newspaper articles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I'll find out, report tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> There's none today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> There's other pictures inside, though, aren't there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You saw inside the pictures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But this picture is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. The other pictures were quite revealing too, because they showed Englishmen and Indian people, foreigners everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, yes. And they have declared that we have distributed "free <span class="Italic">prasādam."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> "To all and sundry."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> You should write and ask for prints. They'll send you proper prints of that in the paper, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh. That's a good idea. We'll try to get the photograph of that, original photograph from the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> We can use it in our magazine. Cover photo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Make it a cover photo for a magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Rival of Nelson."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, "A Rival of Nelson." Just before, maybe two months ago, the boy who was in charge of Ratha-yātrā, Mahā-viṣṇu, we were, he was in so much torment because where was the money going to come from to create such an extravaganza. He wanted to have the best festival ever made. And suddenly he got a letter in the mail: "Your aunt has died, has left you eight thousand pounds." (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So with that money, he has spent everything for Kṛṣṇa, just to glorify Him in that way. He even printed the magazine, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His aunt's money has been properly utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> What arrangements do you want to make for making a model of Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Well, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> When will you be free?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, it depends on... I'll be free...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How much time do you need to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Oh, not very long. Two days maybe. But it'll have to be a bit later on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Maybe if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> August or (indistinct), I've got to go back to Morocco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Do you translate now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You will translate now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Translation? Yes. Everything is ready. Who has taken that <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Must have been Pradyumna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has not come back? Why he hasn't?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes, he's returned with his suitcase. And yours is at the airport. They would not give it to him because it was in my name. So they gave a form. I have to fill out the form and then anyone can pick it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Well, we can go tonight. Make out the form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> (indistinct) are open all twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Make out the form. I'll go right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all phone if they're open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then that's all right. Then do it. I think you have to pay some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes, it will cost money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That's all right. We tried to sell your coin today, but it's only worth three or four pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that's not bad. (laughter) One rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. That's not bad for one rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Prabhupāda has this mint 1935, 1835 rupee piece. Show it to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian rupee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Indian rupee. And we thought it might be pretty valuable. So old, more than one hundred years. We went to three places, they all said three, four pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So highest bid, what was?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> The highest bid I got was one pound. They said if it was in mint condition, we'd get two pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes, I think, (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> He said if it was in perfect condition, mint condition, then he would give me two pounds. But in this condition, only one pound. He brought out many samples of old rupees with different people on them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You said three pounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He told me. He said "Two-three, it's only worth two-three pounds."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> One man said three pounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you sell to them? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> If we tell them... If we go around the city, we could probably get four pounds for it somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So get the best price and sell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't want any antique. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah. Oh, this... Which king is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> That's William the (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, King William. The British...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think Queen Victoria's father. King William. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Uh huh. (Yes.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> When David was commissioned by the Queen's husband, Duke of Edinbur...? Duke of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Edinburgh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Duke of Edinburgh. He went before a committee of the Duke and how many...? You tell us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Twelve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He won a competition over many others for that privilege to make the coins. And his point was that the Queen Mother, the Queen on the coin, it should not be false representation. It should be... What was the...? You were telling us, that it should be as she is, depicted as she is. And they did not agree. But then he showed he, but then he showed them an old British coin. What year was it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">David Wynne:</span> Yes. Well, Queen Elizabeth the First, a gold coin, very beautiful. And I said this was a work of art, and I showed them. It's a very beautiful thing. And I said, "I could do you one like that." So they... So I got the job. But he was very annoyed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> East India Company, it says on here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So the coins were given out by the East India Company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. First of all the Britishers went there as East India Company to have trade connection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Disguise. So we should sell it for any price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Formerly, people could purchase any amount of coins from the currency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> From who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the currency, government currency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any amount of coins. In our childhood... Why our childhood? Even when we were young men, the Indians, generally, they like Guinea gold, British Guinea, what is called, pound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> One pound, one shilling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in India it was available, any amount. You pay price and take. And they would melt it and make ornament, that Guinea gold. There was no restriction. You can purchase any amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Why all of a sudden it changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, they have lost all gold. There is no gold, simply paper. That's all. Simply blessing, "Yes, you'll get money." (laughter) But you'll never get. In the bank also, any amount of gold you can purchase. Bank was canvassing that "You take gold from us." I do not know where those gold gone. Nowhere, all over the world, you cannot purchase gold. Even in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You can purchase some places, but the price is so high for a small amount.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Zurich, you can get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes, Switzerland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot get out with the gold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> No, officially not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well? Then? Suppose you purchase gold there. If you want to take out, they will not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Not if they find it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Officially, no, they will not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these currency notes, the price, commodity, has gone so high due to this rascal currency. Because your enemy country, they print counterfeit and they overflood in the market. So how you can check it? You cannot check. I know, during wartime, a Chinese man was coming in Calcutta, and he had a purchasing agent who was my friend. So he would come, and he would give a list of goods, especially rare medicines, and he'll deposit with him bunch of notes, "You spend, purchase, and whatever..." That means all those notes were counterfeit. (end)</div>
