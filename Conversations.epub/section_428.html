<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña</span> means to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ISKCON has a camera.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Should we take a picture right here? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...philosophy and the so many bogus swamis' philosophies, they are different. They offer some material benefit by their philosophy. "If you take this <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> then your material life will be easier." People are captivated for material benefit. Spiritual benefit, they do not understand, and neither our philosophy provides any facility for material benefit. Although spiritual benefit includes material benefit, but people do not understand this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It appears that by taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one becomes less materially benefitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the benefit they do not understand. Here the philosophy is to make nil material benefit. And that is sometimes havoc for others. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says... (aside:) Don't bring near. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya. Niṣkiñcana</span> means... <span class="Italic">Kiñcana</span> means something and <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana</span> means even no something. <span class="Italic">Kiñcana</span> means something, to possess something, and <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana</span> means to possess nothing. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya. Bhagavad-bhajana...</span> So go back to home back to Godhead, is meant for such persons who has nothing to possess here. That is very difficult. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya pāraṁ paraṁ jigamiṣor bhava-sāgarasya.</span> The real aim, real benefit, is how to be transferred to the other nature, spiritual nature. <span class="Italic">Pāraṁ param.</span> They do not know that beyond the sky, there is spiritual sky, there is another nature. They have no information. Even they do not know what are there in higher planetary systems. They think, "Here everything is..." This is an insignificant planet in the whole creation, but their fund of knowledge so poor, they think this is the position. They are trying to maintain what was achieved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We can go down. We can go around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The stones seem very rough. Maybe we go back this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> There are stones on the ground, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> A little material benefit, that increase, they take to be spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gymnastic. Just like a man, by bodily exercise, he becomes a little strong. His digestive function becomes very easy, he can eat more. He can enjoy more sex life. These benefits they want. And if you promise all these benefits, they become attracted. And they cannot understand, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> After giving up this body, we do not accept anymore material body, but go to back to home, back to... These things they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Can we take a picture right here, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is beyond their understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We are the only ones who are preaching like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritual benefits, they do not understand. What is this building? This is also old construction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's a church. (asking someone:) Is that from the Roman empire? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in right position. All wonderful buildings, there is no doubt. Such huge buildings in any other parts of the world is not visible. Just the thickness of the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They kept many slaves the Romans. They had many slaves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Slaves? This word is used in Vedic language also, slave. The Africans, they were meant for becoming slaves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, can we take a picture here please?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kirāta-hūṇāndhra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.4.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> So the Kirātas, they were always slaves of the Āryans. The Āryan people used to keep slaves, but they were treating slaves very nicely. Later on it degraded. Otherwise, slaves were kept just like family members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They had no resentment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they were very happy. Just like you keep a dog. It is slave but it is very happy under the protection of good master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Actually, they like to work hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they like to work hard and they want good protection. That is their happiness. Even still in Africa, the servants, domestic servants, Africans, I have seen in Indian family, they are very happy. They are very happy, and the master also takes care of them. They want to eat sumptuously, and that's all. They have no other ambition. They don't want any motorcar or like this, no. And they work very nicely, domestic work, very clean. But sometimes they steal. That is their habit. My father used to say, "If you do not allow the servants to steal, so don't keep." Don't keep servants. "A servant who does not steal, he is not a gentleman. He must steal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He must steal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is their satisfaction. So you must allow them. In old <span class="Italic">zamindar</span> family, they will pay the manager five rupees per month, salary, and allow them to steal. That was simply a token salary that "You are servant." And the manager was so clever, he would steal, but he would not spoil the property of the master. He will manage very nicely that he will extra, make extra income and steal. The master will not be touched. Master will be happy. Master knows that "I am paying him five rupees. That is nothing." And he is constructing big building, getting his sons and daughters married very luxuriantly. Master is... Even fifty years before, there was a <span class="Italic">zamindar,</span> Raja Manindra Candranandi. He was very magnanimous man, making various charities. So if somebody will complain, "Sir, your this servant is stealing like this," he would be very angry. The man who complains, he will be angry upon him, "Why do you come and complain?" He will not accept any complaint. Rather, he will be angry with the man who complains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> May we have one more picture, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. What are the history of these buildings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> These were temples here, demigod temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This style of building, arch, is seen in New Delhi also, constructed by the Moguls. This was also a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No. This was an arena where they used to watch wrestling, fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...devotees, they do not want any opulence of this material world. They are, what is called, pessimistic. They do not give any value to the opulence of this material world. And it is very good philosophy. But fools and rascals, they are attracted. Now, these buildings were constructed, very highly intellectual men undoubtedly, but they enjoyed, say, for hundred years. That's all. Then their bodies changed, and nobody knows what kind of body he has got. This is materialism. Suppose if you are offered some very nice comfortable life, and if you know that "Next life I am going to become a dog," would you be happy? But they have no information that what next body... Body, he has to take another body. He cannot enjoy. Whatever he has created, he cannot enjoy for good. That is not possible. He has to leave it. Just like these Romans. They have left. They constructed so big, big building just to enjoy, but they had to leave it by nature's force and accept another body. That they do not know. They are satisfied, "Never mind, I accept the next life a dog's body. Now let me enjoy this, say, twenty-five years or fifty years, that's all." This is their philosophy. No future. "Trust no future, however pleasant." In India, those who are interested in spiritual life, they take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Everybody <span class="Italic">sannyāsa, bābājī.</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī gave up his service, everything, and became no possessions voluntarily. Big, big kings, Bharata Mahārāja... To practice that "I have no more interest in anything material." [break] ...introduction of my Guru Mahārāja that <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and preachers may use big, big buildings, motorcars and..., just to give the information to the western world. Because they, if you ask them, that "You become a mendicant, possessionless," still, they are not very much interested. Because they see our dress, our living condition is not very equal to their standard, they do not like. Is it not? Yes. So just to give these Westerners facilities at least to understand this philosophy, this method was accepted by Guru Mahārāja, to live in nice building, to have cars, to use everything for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise, nobody would take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It was revolutionary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Tyāga-bhūmikā,</span> renouncement. The platform of renouncement. So how this was broken, by war fights or what? Huh? Last war?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. The bombs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> These are all holes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, in humanity. The historical buildings, what is there? They destroy them. This building, I think it was constructed later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah, this is new building. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...couldn't understand how they put the buildings together, how they stayed so long, what they used to make it stay together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yesterday Dhanañjaya said the Coliseum was made of marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is the same earth, but they make it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Plaster it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. To be stronger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Special earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...spiritual culture, they cannot even enjoy materially very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are so many buildings we see the frog (?)... (end)</div>
