<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...in <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He doesn't feel that he'll be able to surrender to whatever instruction you give so he doesn't want to appear before you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) He doesn't want to become a cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) That's all. Formerly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Just like that Sudāmā and Subala...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They came for instruction, but then, when you gave them instruction, they said, "No." So what was the use of their coming? That's his feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, in that way he's very sincere, I know. So what is there? I love him. Let him come. After all, he is my son. There is no harm. Let him come. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Right here. See on the left there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break] (inside)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...admire your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Sometimes they sit here and they pull books to examine the quality of the printing, and they always read the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine while they wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. Ah. Latest publication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> printer frames these for us. He brings them over after every issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They are giving good service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are very fond of us. They spend more time on our magazine than anyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is Sītā, the wife of Advaita Ācārya receiving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is in <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> Volume Three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has painted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Jadurāṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jadurāṇī has got good talent. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is the office where I work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is developed photo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is a drawing by a boy in New York named Peter Hawkins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drawing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> A drawing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have two warehouses... [break] ...to the wall and up to the ceiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are going or simply stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No. It is greatly reduced since they have arrived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Haṁsadūta, he has to make a <span class="Italic">go-down</span> like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he'll defeat these charges. Eh? When the nation, German nation, will accept these books, then that will be proper reply, charges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This forklift lifts these pallets high up to the ceiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Does Prabhupāda want to see how it work? Śruta-śravā, you can show him how it works? Quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These racks we purchased for storing the books that will be sent to the libraries and colleges. When Satsvarūpa Swami gets the orders, they are reserved over here, five hundred copies of each book, and then, when we run out, another five hundred copies goes in the rack. So that way, we always keep books. Even if we sell out, we always have books reserved for the libraries. Śruta-śravā manages our warehouse. (engine started)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Make it go up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I first saw this machine in the Commonwealth Pier, Boston. (machine moving around, crashing sound)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> What are you doing, Śruta-śravā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes because of that roof you can't see what you're doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So usually he's very careful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometime they are breaking also. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So far, no accidents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Just today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's a little nervous. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> 1,800 dollars each month for all the offices in the warehouse. It's considered a good price in this area. We have a speaker system, so during the day, while they work in the warehouse, they're always hearing your lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is the other warehouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is arrangement for fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. We have fire insurance and fire alarm. We have fire alarm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have fire alarm? These are <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Trilogies.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All these? All these, stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We always require large inventory because the temples order so fast. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> in this corner, and on this back wall here, all the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatams</span> and <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> volumes... These books have just arrived from the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that Prajāpati? He's not here? That play yesterday... Last evening I saw. It was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. They also did Pralambāsura for the guests.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Now we have got <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> If such demonstration are done very nicely, it will be very much appreciated even by the public. We can collect some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. We plan to make a tour this summer all the way up the West Coast, and in the amphitheaters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in India also. Simply you have to change the language, dictate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Of the narration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. They're planning to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our festival let them come and show. What is this? That man? What is his name who showed Gaurāṅga <span class="Italic">līlā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, Harigovind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be hundred times better than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Thousand times. Ten thousand, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So show this nonsense that "We can do better than you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's much more beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They're coming to Māyāpur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yesterday at the love feast they did Pralambāsura, and the guests loved it. Wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They applauded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must love it. It is very nice, very nice. Organize this very nicely. We have got so many boys and girls. They can play simply. And they haven't got to speak. This system is very nice. Let them play. What is this called, system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Narration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Like pantomime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Mime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even they play with tape. Tape... Tapes... The tape is going on, and then are playing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, they also do that sometimes. They have tapes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So organize this, and all over the world this will be appreciated. And now we have got so many books. From the book you get subject matter and make a playwright in all languages. It will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They have a repertoire of eight main ones that they can do, and now they're starting to do others also, from <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> etc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think he is good director, Prajāpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. His wife is very expert also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And also you can call... What is he? Jagad-dhita...? That Australian girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Oh, yes, Jagatāriṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jagatāriṇī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> She can come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. She is expert dancer. She was very popular actress before joining. Very, very popular actress. You know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> I've heard the name, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was a newspaper, big, big..., that "This girl has given up everything, now has joined Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yesterday one professional skydiver, one who parachutes from a plane for money, I talked to her. She's joining the dance company. Yesterday. Thirty-four years old, professional parachuter woman, she is joining the dance company. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our dance company?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes, our dance company. She saw the dance, and I preached to her. She's joining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśākhā:</span> We plan to make a motion picture of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> dance that they do. My husband and I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it. Apply your American brain how to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is success.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Whatever talent one has got... These talents are also acquired after austerity. It is not ordinary thing. So everything should be employed to describe Uttamaśloka, Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is Uttamaśloka. So we have got so many Kṛṣṇa's pastimes, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's pastime. We can overflood. Just like you can overflood with this literature, we can overflood... This is art. Art, music, everything we can utilize. In any way one is addicted-let him eat only, let him sing only, let him paint only, let him dance only-we have got everything. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Let him do business also. Yes. Engineering-construct temple. It is so all-perfect movement, Kṛṣṇa... That is Kṛṣṇa, all-attractive. Everyone can be attracted and give up everything. He will be attracted by Kṛṣṇa in such a way that he'll give up all nonsense. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. No more other enga... <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> All other attraction finished. Simply Kṛṣṇa. What are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These boxes have come from the printer all ready to go to different countries, and they stamp the address on it. These are those newspapers you saw yesterday called <span class="Italic">"Spiritual Revolution."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this Revolution is not very important. Make revolution with magazine, this <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> What are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, Lord Caitanya in Five Features,</span> that chapter that we printed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> These are the ones that you wanted us to bring for distribution to the Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Just before Christmas this wall was filled up, and now it is practically empty. We have sold so many books just in a few months. All up to the ceiling it was filled up. Now we have to reprint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it is only in English language. In every language such big <span class="Italic">go-down</span> should... Yes. (chuckles) You have taken Spanish, and he is German. Then... Then overflood. No more other literature. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Ara nāhe bābā.</span> They'll say, "No, no, we don't want any other literature." Yes, George says, "No more singing anything except Kṛṣṇa." Does he not say? He says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes. Sometimes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think... Is he singing any other song, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Now he is not. He's going to Vṛndāvana next week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Vṛndāvana. Where he'll stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I wrote him a letter to stay with us, but he may stay in Mathurā. I'm not sure. I wrote him a letter to stay at our place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have enough space here to store all the Spanish books, because they are printed in Los Angeles, or in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Maybe we should walk around again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think no religious publisher have seen such big <span class="Italic">go-down</span> in their life, throughout the whole world. As soon as they will hear about religious book they immediately avoid it, especially the Communist country. And bring some Communist country man to show him that "You are trying to avoid God. Now see how we are preaching God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In one country, Communist country, Albania, they made it against the law to pray in public or in private. Anyone who is found praying in public or in private may be arrested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Albania. It is the first country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Armenian country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Albania.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Albania, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> East Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how demons they are becoming. What is this room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This leads into the other rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> These are offices. The first office is where Kirtirāja works. He is managing all the distribution for the libraries and colleges. Satsvarūpa's party sends in the orders, and they process them from here. They handle all the business from this part of the warehouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's Māyāpur, Lord Caitanya's birthplace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogapīṭha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's family. <span class="Italic">"Book Digest.</span>" They publish our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> We are trying to arrange that now. All of these different... There are so many magazines we are trying to get our books listed in them. Śrīla Prabhupāda, here's a magazine which one Christian press nearby has printed, very fancy magazine, and they were distributing it for free. They just recently printed a letter and then sent this. They have gone from this to this because they cannot afford to do it any more. No one is giving them donations any more, so they've gone from big fancy magazine to a small, plain paper. This people would like to see, but now this just looks like garbage. They won't even read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it has degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Yes. We have gone from this to fancy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is our catalog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Yes, we are printing a new one now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Unfortunately those are returns. When people don't want the books, then they return them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very few returns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Very few, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind. That is not as strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> Now we have about almost 125 standing orders for <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and about almost one hundred for <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have just recently given Satsvarūpa a new car. So now he has four vans and a station wagon car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four vans?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Four vans and one station wagon car, so he's able to cover so many universities very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is Hṛdayānanda Swami's office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Spanish office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> These are the color pictures for our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> we are printing this week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. <span class="Italic">Mas Alla?</span> (pronounces <span class="Italic">"masalla</span>")</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It's not spice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That means "beyond." <span class="Italic">"Beyond Birth and Death.</span>" And that's the cover for our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It is also spicy.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. But make them devotees. That is the real father and mother, who begets children and make him devotee. That is real father and mother. Otherwise cats and dogs. A Tulasī dāsa, he has written one poetry that "A son and the urine comes from the same way." Son... Son means it is born out of the semina. That also comes through the genital, and the urine also comes through the genital. So he is giving this example that <span class="Italic">"Putra</span> and <span class="Italic">Mutra..." Mutra,</span> means urine, and <span class="Italic">putra</span> means son, comes from the same passage. So if the son is a devotee, then he's <span class="Italic">putra;</span> otherwise he's <span class="Italic">mutra.</span> (laughter) Otherwise he's urine. Very nice. Yes. <span class="Italic">Putra</span> and <span class="Italic">mutra</span> come from the same channel. If he's a devotee, then he's <span class="Italic">putra,</span> otherwise he's <span class="Italic">mutra.</span> [break] ...miseries are compared with the heat and cold. <span class="Italic">Mātrā sparśās tu kaunteya śītoṣṇa-sukha-duḥkha-dāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 2.14]<span class="Italic">. Śīta</span> and <span class="Italic">uṣṇa. Uṣṇa</span> means hot, and <span class="Italic">śīta</span> means cold. They are pleasing and miserable in circumstances. Cold is very pleasing in the summer, and heat is very pleasing in winter. But same heat in summer is not pleasing, and same cold in winter, it is not pleasing. So what is the actual position of cold and heat? It is simply transforming as pleasure and pain according to circumstances. Otherwise it is neither painful, neither pleasing. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma iva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc.

It is a little long. I don't wish to divert your attention. Very interesting story. That is also mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad..., aniketa.</span> One may have many nice places to live; still, he should think that "I have no place to live." That is one of the spiritual items.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What is that story, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? (laughter) Story is that there was a joker-His name was Gopal Bahn-of a king, Rāja Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇanagar, you know? Near Māyāpur? Yes, the king of that place. So they used to keep joker to please them by words. So the joker was constructing a new building. So it is almost finished, but there was no opening ceremony. So Rāja advised his, one of his another friends, that "If you can go and pass urine in that new house of Gopal-the joker's name-before the opening ceremony, then I'll give you so much prize. Go and pass urine there." (chuckles) So, "Yes, I'll do it." So... No, "Pass stool." Yes. "Go and pass stool there. Then I'll give you so much advance." So one day he made this plan. He was passing, and all of a sudden entered: "Gopal, I am very much called by nature. Kindly show me where I shall pass stool. Where I shall pass?" So Gopal was intelligent, that it is, there is some plan. "Yes, yes, here is lavatory. You come here." So he is... Everything was false. So then he said, "The door must be open. You pass stool there, but I'll see that you are passing stool and door must be open." "Now, how it is possible?" "No, it is possible. You can pass stool, but you cannot pass urine. If you pass urine, then I shall kill you." Passing stool without passing urine, how it is possible? "So you have come to pass stool. That you can do here, but don't pass urine." (laughs) So that is my position. "You may have hundreds of places, but you cannot live anywhere." That is Kṛṣṇa's order. [break] ...place not to become attached. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Just like Nārada Muni got that curse from Lord Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not Lord Brahmā, by Dakṣarāja, that "You cannot stay anywhere more than three minutes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He is still doing that? Nārada Muni?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. His business is preaching. So we have to become, every one of us, disciple of Nārada Muni. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...American people are spending, and it is going to the American people, not outside. So it is not bad idea, distribution of money. Therefore America is so opulent. Nobody's miserly. Everyone is spending. Therefore the benefit is distributed. I have got money, I am spending, so benefit is distributed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Now all the rich men in India have got all their money locked up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, locked up. (end)</div>
