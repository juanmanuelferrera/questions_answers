<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to be free from mind also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Free from mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very difficult to control mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you want freedom, you have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, that's true. There is no other alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Freedom from mind, how would you explain it or how would you detail it? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...mind means polluted mind. We are part and parcel of God. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">. Jīva</span> is as pure as God and on account of this mind, he is suffering in this material world. You can see. You can see. Here is a living being, this tree. It is also a living being, but he's standing before me for fifty years or more than that. He cannot move an inch, and we are moving. So why this condition? He is also living being; I am also living being. I have got little freedom to move; he hasn't got. Why this difference of position? Due to the mind. So here in this material world there are 8,400,000 different forms of life. They're all due to the mental concoction. So if we want our original life as good as God, at least in quality, that is freedom of mind. And then we cease to become one of the covered living beings within this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, I read in one of your lectures at London, before the British office (indistinct), and you gave the example of Mahatma Gandhi and Kennedy. In particular, Mahatma Gandhi you said that four types of (sic:) defaulted mind and this condition and those condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Every living being is polluted by four kinds of deficiencies. A conditioned soul commits mistake. He takes something for something. And because he has no perfect knowledge, he wants to become leader. That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Right. You have said that in that speech.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And, above all, his senses are imperfect. Therefore, from such persons with deficiency, how you can get real knowledge? That is not possible. We have to approach a person who has no deficiency. Then we shall get real knowledge. So Kṛṣṇa and His representative are persons without any deficiencies. So we have to take knowledge from Kṛṣṇa or one who represents Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise we'll be cheated, because he has got deficiencies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But that you have said, that one of his colleague or assistant told to Gandhi that "There is danger, and you shouldn't go to the meeting," and in spite of that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I did not say. I wrote one letter to Gandhi that, "Mahatmaji, you have got some respectability throughout the whole world. Now you struggled for so-called <span class="Italic">svarāja.</span> Now you have got it. Better retire from this life and preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think he listened to your advice because before he was murdered, on that day...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Otherwise you'll meet the fate of Mussolini."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And what was his reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not reply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He drafted that statement that Congress should be dissolved. It should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. He was implicated. This is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that although he got <span class="Italic">svarāja,</span> he was not free. He was full of anxiety, and he he was not at all... (aside:) <span class="Italic">Ayi. Jaya.</span> So long one is absorbed in material thoughts, he'll be full of anxieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's true. He was full of anxieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means he could not get any spiritual idea. <span class="Italic">Asad grahāt.</span> Material existence means accepting something which will not exist, <span class="Italic">asat. Asato mā sad gamaya.</span> The Vedic instruction is: "Do not remain in this material world, and make your progress..." <span class="Italic">Asato mā sad gamaya.</span> But people are so accustomed to materialistic way of life that they are reluctant. That is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> very strong. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is very, very difficult. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> tries to punish every conditioned soul, and as soon as there is some attempt to get out of the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> she becomes still strong: "Where you shall go my dear son? You remain with me." <span class="Italic">Yaḥ devī sarva-bhūteṣu nidra-rūpiṇa sam...(?)</span> In the <span class="Italic">Caṇḍī, yaḥ devī,</span> he is situated, keeping the conditioned souls in dream. He is simply dreaming, "I'll be happy in this way; I'll be happy in that way." And that is mental concoction. He'll never be happy. Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ, āsurīṁ bhāvam āśri... [Bg. </span>9.12]. Because he has not recognized the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all his hopes and endeavors will be baffled. So even a person like Mahatma Gandhi, he became baffled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, that's right. He admitted also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what to speak of others. His ambition was Hindu-Muslim unity. So that was banned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Total failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His ambition was nonviolent-he was killed by violence. So what to speak of others? A person so dedicated, so nice, but he followed the wrong path. Recently I had been to his Sevasram in Wardha. So there was no Kṛṣṇa worship and he said that he is very fond of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But he understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in his own way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (laughing) In a different way, I would say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, as soon as you try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in your own way, it is finished. It is finished. <span class="Italic">Naṣṭa. Yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> So <span class="Italic">naṣṭa</span> cheese, what is <span class="Italic">naṣṭa,</span> what is the use of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It should be destroyed. No use to it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if I supply you something which is spoiled, then what benefit you will derive? Therefore no benefit is derived by the people in general either from Gandhi or Vinoba Bhave or Tilak because it was <span class="Italic">naṣṭa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, how do you compare it with... This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...for the common man, for the downtrodden, for the poor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and they will understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That should be some motivation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if you are hungry, if you get some real food, you'll understand. Example is these American, European boys. They are simply chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and you see how they are advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How come that in this country they...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately come. But you won't take. That is your fault. You have manufactured your own way of life. Otherwise, Hare Kṛṣṇa is India's gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's not much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you won't take it. He'll speak so many nonsense; he'll never speak Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What are the aims of the Indian society. Although it's given birth to so much, it still doesn't take it as success. What is the weakness in the Indian society that they don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have got bad leaders, the rascal leaders. Just like see. Mahatma Gandhi, he misled. But he did not know how to lead. And what to speak of others. They do not know. I saw this Vinoba Bhave, he does not know anything. He has become leader. I saw in his <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> about one dozen women, they are reciting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That's all. And for the last forty years he's working on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and the result is some forty women is reciting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So this is the result. So what they will do? They do not know how to lead. And he has written one book on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but he has become a great leader. And that is also not according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This is going on. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Unfortunately, he has... There are not very silent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take for example <span class="Italic">satyagraha. Satyagraha...</span> What is the <span class="Italic">satyagraha?</span> That is the child's play. Just like a child, he wants something. You are not giving him. He'll cry. He'll force you. So is there any <span class="Italic">śāstric</span> injunction? Now these things have become popular. Real thing rejected, and some false thing presented by childish attempt, that is accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But sir, would you not agree that in order to appeal to the masses or to make masses into any movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is... You see... It is not... If you want to become an educated man or if you want to give first-class education, it is not for the mass. It is for the leader. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tat tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If the leaders are educated, then others will follow. But if the leaders are not educated, what the others will do? That is the difficulty. And the so-called leaders, without being educated, they become leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's why all this trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They manufacture some idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Which has nothing to do with the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing to do... It is spoiled. If you manufacture idea, because you are imperfect... How you can manufacture ideas? Four deficiencies are there, so if you manufacture with deficiency of your own person, then what will be the knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The result will also be deficiency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difficulty. Our knowledge... <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhaḥ.</span> So who can be more <span class="Italic">śreṣṭha</span> than Kṛṣṇa? Than Vyāsadeva, Nārada, the <span class="Italic">ācāryas?</span> But they will not follow. They will manufacture some idea. That is the difficulty in India at the present moment. Some upstart leaders, they have misled them. That is the difficulty. And we are poor fellows. If we say the right thing, they'll not take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not only take it but they'll ridicule and say that something has gone wrong somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll not take it: "No! What is this Swamiji...? Mahatma Gandhi says this and this... Tilak says this, this, that." And if we say that they are wrong, then people will criticize, "Oh, he has become more than..." This is the difficulty. We don't say anything except what is said by the great personalities that are Kṛṣṇa conscious. So I am not saying anything of my own manufacture. I am simply saying what Kṛṣṇa has said. But they will reject that. I say that Kṛṣṇa says that you become a Kṛṣṇa's devotee. It is very simple for me. And they will say, "Huh! What is this nonsense Kṛṣṇa? We have seen this Kṛṣṇa. Now we have got this leader." This is the problem. <span class="Italic">Upadeṣo hi mūrkhāṇāṁ prakopāya na śāntaye.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> They reject it because they find it difficult to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not at all difficulty. What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> So then why do they reject it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I say that "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," what is the difficulty? But he thinks that "This is insignificant." He thinks like that. What I am teaching these people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very simple thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very simple thing, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." I have not given them any bribe. I have not shown them any magic of gold manufacturing. From the very beginning I said, "You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." But that is becoming fruitful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That gives them peace of mind, because their mind gets attuned to something that is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that they will not take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That they will not take for what reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reason is: "This is cheap. The swami is giving something cheap." Nowadays it has become a fashion, "Meditation." What nonsense meditation he will do?" This is going on. He cannot take cheap thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Cheap thing may be the right thing, the true thing, but "Because it's cheap, (laughing) so we..., not to be bothered."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Europe, America, the Indian students, they say, "Oh, we have seen all this Hare Kṛṣṇa. We now want technology."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Sir, I got into conversation this young man in Colombo for the simple reason that I have got five sons, and those sons are trying to be Westernized or Americanized to the extent that I couldn't believe that my own children would go to this extent. So I told Girirāja when he came to see me and introduced my children to them, and it has now little impact. Because now that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Don't sit down there. Don't sit down there. (Hindi) No, sitting on the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You move it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is the daughter of <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> They have come with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not ask him. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Now they have, after seeing these young men, they have started thinking that "Why these young men (laughing) from America are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and why we are not doing?" I said, "You just think it over."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) No, America... The purpose of going to America for... This was one of the cause, that "When I bring Americans here, these rascals will take some lesson."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think you are absolutely right. (laughing) Psychologically, somehow or other, anything that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And long, long ago, in the beginning, one friend wrote. I replied in that letter, that "You have finished your cows. You are importing powdered milk. Now you have to import <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> also from America. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> True, absolutely true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, you see that we are establishing so many temples. They are being maintained by imported American <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> You cannot get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Same thing in Aurobindo. I went to Pondicherry also this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot get here now <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> They have learned how to eat meat, how to drink, how to have illicit sex. They are finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No more <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> You are right. That's tragedy. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Some of them must be non-greedy, not greedy, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many good men. It is not that simply <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> have gone to hell, but everyone has gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct) has failed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Śamo damas titikṣā ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.42]. (Hindi) Nobody's... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, the other day I was with Natalia in Japan, and he also said the same thing, that we have no training for the leaders. And because there is no proper leadership, everything comes to a zero. You have to train a man or a woman for a particular work. That is not being done in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> British did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They made their servants quite all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They wanted for graft, to manipulate their empire. They wanted some subordinate hands. They never wanted to give real education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They wanted that the... That is cooperation. That is one of the Gandhi's understanding, that "These people are ruling over us by our cooperation. Therefore let us noncooperate and they'll fail. They'll not be able to rule."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Carry on their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that program was also failure because India is so poor that there was no possible to noncooperate, because Gandhi's civil disobedience movement only 60,000 men joined, and we have 600,000,000. So what is the percentage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Not even one percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that also, when they came back from the jail life, they decided not to do it again. Therefore Gandhi did not recommend mass civil disobedience next time. He recommended individual... [break] ...but (indistinct) 19l7, and we got <span class="Italic">svarāja</span> in 1947. So it was not due to civil disobedience or noncooperation. It was due to Subash Bose's INA. He thought that when he organized soldiers, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Put them on the battlefield, fought them, defeated them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And when the Britishers found, "Now the soldiers are non-cooperating. There is no hope of ruling," they left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. That is the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Subash Bose was always against this nonviolent means. That is the difference of opinion with Gandhi. So he wanted to capture the whole power, and he captured, but Gandhi became so angry upon him that he did not attend the Congress when Subash Bose was elected President. Then other lieutenants-Subash Bose also was Gandhi's student-so when others planned, requested that "Gandhiji is not happy. You better resign." So he resigned, and tactfully he went out of India. He knew that "So long Gandhi is there, my policy... I'll not be able because there will be..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Always opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...opposition." Therefore he went out and organized the INA, and that was successful. It is not Gandhi's noncooperation movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's true. Now in the British official records which they are publishing their secret papers of twenty-five years, that knowledge is very clearly that it was this armed fight of Indian National Army which convinced the British that they could not rule India with the Indian soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real noncooperation. (laughter) What this public noncooperation will do. They are simply clerks. Some of them may be high-court judges, but no responsible post was given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> And all these atrocities were committed by Indians upon Indians at the orders of the British.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the big, big secretaries, under-secretaries, governors... There was no minister, all European, only some clerks. So what is the use of clerks' noncooperation? They didn't care. And in order to pat Gandhi, the governor sometimes used to invite him. "Sir, you are so powerful. Kindly stop this movement." And Gandhi became puffed-up that the Britishers are very afraid of him. "No! I shall do." And Subash Bose insisting, "In this way, they'll never go by this nonviolent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Human nature as it is, you can't... Unless there is some sort of a compulsion, whether in spiritual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And in politics, might is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Of course. Survival of the fittest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In politics you cannot become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> A <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> It is absurd. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is absurd.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Two contradictory terms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Arjuna was ridiculed. "What is this nonsense?" <span class="Italic">Kutas tvā kaśmalam idam:</span> "You have come to fight. You are talking nonsense, that 'I will not fight.' " Kṛṣṇa did not approve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He told... He defined "What is your <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and what is <span class="Italic">niṣkāma akarma.</span>" So it's very difficult to define <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> but once it is defined, there should be no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is there. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And everything is cheating. That... Because we are teaching that, that only <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, therefore we are not very much liked. They are of opinion, "Why Kṛṣṇa is God? I have got this God. I have got this, so many incarnations." This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Why do you say we are not very much liked? The movement is spreading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we are fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But the movement is spreading, I am saying. I Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is spreading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Movement will spread, undoubtedly, because it is genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is spreading because we are liked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, sir, there you are also correct. I would say this, that these American boys and young girls who have come here, because this, our mind is conditioned into inferiority complex or slave-minded person, everything which is adopted there must be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are also slaves, but we are slave of the right person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, of the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference. And they are slaves of their senses. That is the difference. We are not master. We are also slaves. But we are slaves of the person who is perfect, and they are slaves of their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The spread of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement in Bombay in the last three, four years has been... I don't know, you may not be satisfied, but I think it's quite good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it will be good. If people take to it little seriously, it will be good. Therefore we are spending so much money, that "You come, you all respectable and educated people. Come, try to understand and spread it for the benefit of your country."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But sir, your conclusion here is correct in the sense that they say that "Swami only says you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, and by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa what could be done?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, but they have no eyes to see how it is being done all over the world. They do not consider it, what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How it's done, why it's done, what is the result. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Film-<span class="Italic">wala</span>...? What is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Devanand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He purposefully criticized this movement by Hare Kṛṣṇa film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, yes, I have seen that film.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are going on. He is finished. His film is finished, but we are going on. But he tried purposefully that "This is a hippie movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, "Hippie movement, <span class="Italic">bhāng, gāñjā,</span> and all sex and perversion of all sorts."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> This cloud on the movement in America, is that vanishing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will vanish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It will. It's bound to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although they are making some strong movement against this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But what is the position now? Is it dying out or increasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We are selling more books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, is the cloud dying out? I'm not saying the movement is dying out. The movement cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are... Now how much worth of books we have sold in one week?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Forty-three <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> worth of books we have sold in one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Girirāja said that's the main source of income for this movement, as a matter of fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes we are getting ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees every month from that book department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, that's the main source. Because I inquired with him that whether it is not something to do with CIA, wherefrom your money comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how foolish. The CIA, American CIA, they will pay us, (laughter) and these boys, CIA boys, will come and dance with me. (laughter) Just understand how these Indians have become rascals. They have no common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Perverts I would say. Perverts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is being supported, "Oh, they are CIA."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So I talked at great length with Girirāja, and I cross-examined him thoroughly with all these Indians who would be thinking about this Hare Kṛṣṇa because when I said that I have become a life member of yours, then he also might have been bit surprised, but mainly I wanted to impress upon my children-they're young boys-that "It's all right. You also go there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Once spoiled, it is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To reform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Then minds are spoiled; that is true. Their minds are, all Indian youth completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have spoiled them. You have given this impression that "This 'religion, religion, religion' has spoiled our country. Now throw it, all these books, in the water." The leaders say that. "Take to technology." They come to me. They challenge, "Swamiji, what this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement will do? Now we require technology." This is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is properly explained to a Westernized Indian, it gets accepted sooner than the difficult...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Impact from these young boys and girls is good, very good, I should say. These young boys and girls who are working here by their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their one qualification is that they are not poverty stricken. And our boys, they are poverty stricken. So <span class="Italic">daridra-doṣa guṇa-rāśi-nāśī.(?)</span> Even though are educated, on account of poverty they sacrificed everything their culture, their knowledge. <span class="Italic">Daridra-doṣa guṇa-rāśi-nāśī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, hunger is the cause of all. (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I chastise them only because they don't care for money. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They are extreme. It is contradiction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And because they are fortunate, wherever they go, they get money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is law of nature. All the big rivers go to the sea where water is not wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen them. They squander so much money, and I chastise them that "You are so loose, you are so rascal and..." But still, whatever money I have got, it is due to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's true, that's true. (laughter) That's true. That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise... (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Really, it is true. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have tried convinced them. <span class="Italic">Janmaiśvarya-śruta-śrīḥ [SB </span>1.8.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> to become moneyed, that also requires background. <span class="Italic">Pūrva-janmārjitaṁ dhanam.</span> So they are born in rich country; that is due to their past pious deeds. Yes. There is no doubt. Yes. Now I request them that "You have got everything. You take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then you are perfect."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> We have degraded ourself to such an extent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can rise immediately.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's a difficult job, but it has to be done because I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. Kṛṣṇa says,</div>

<div class="After-Verse">Our difficulties are due to our sinful activities. So Kṛṣṇa assures, "I will excuse you from the resultant action of all sinful activities. You surrender to me." But I will not do that. What Kṛṣṇa will do? He says, He assures, but nobody will do that. I say to my tenants here, that "You become Kṛṣṇa conscious. You won't have to pay rent." (laughter) Because the whole rent... I am getting two-thousand, 2,500. That is my one day's expenditure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Eventually they will come around, but it will take time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the leaders are not... Because their position will be finished, the so-called leaders. They want to keep in ignorance the mass of people so their foolish leadership may go on continually. That is everywhere. [break] ...learn this philosophy and preach. That is the best service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> My son who lives in America is very Westernized, and as he picked up <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> and he tried to understand it.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Shh! Swamiji's saying is this, that <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is interpreted by different people in different way. That is true. Understanding of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is a very big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. According to his own whims... But the original <span class="Italic">śloka</span> is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But interpretation is his own.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Original <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> of course, everybody would put. Then they interpret in their own way. I think, sir, most of us are accepted through this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, as you have rightly said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the public opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Public opinion, people like us who have been abroad for, say, quarter of a century or so... I have been to the States. I almost go every year. And this is the right thing. This is the right thing. When I was child, about fifteen, I went to Japan, and all my life I am abroad. This is the right thing. This is simple. It's only a matter of conviction. If you have faith, then everything becomes quite all right. There is nothing much that is extraordinary that could not be done. It's a pure, simple, good life. Get up early in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) They supply water regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One question is almost complete, and they have become sort of influence of (Hindi) reception or whatever name you call it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Why have you said Cinmayananda, atheist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many statements. In his book there are so many statements. Does he recommend to worship Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Does he recommend to worship Śrī Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I don't know. I have not read...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then why you are asking about him? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, my point is he is preaching religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is nonsense. You do not know about him, and you are asking about him. That is the pity. If you know about him, then speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, I don't know enough about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are recommending? Then why you are recommending?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But he's preaching religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you don't know religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He is preaching <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> that's true, but as Swamiji says, that is interpretation of his own. Original words are there. Everybody who speaks about <span class="Italic">Gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. But he does not recommend to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. What does he know about Kṛṣṇa? That is the difficulty. He does not know what is Kṛṣṇa, what is religion, and he is preaching religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He's supposed to be one of the biggest propagator of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> He had <span class="Italic">Gītāra jñāna yajña</span> in Bombay. There were thousands of people there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> False, everything false. Misled. He does not recognize Kṛṣṇa, he does not recognize religion, and he is religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One of the best religious leaders. That's what people think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that may be, falsely representation, but where he is recommending that "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa and worship Him"? Has he done that? That means misleading. He can become a very good orator, and he can get claps, but what is the benefit? He's a good orator, there is no doubt about it. But Kṛṣṇa does not say that "You become a orator and cheat others." He does not say. He says, "Surrender unto Me." So if actually one is preaching, he should teach the audience that "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." And that is reading of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If I take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and speak something of my opinion, that means I am cheating. I am taking advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and I am impressing people with my nonsense ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to cheat others, you cheat in your own way. Why do you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Don't take the protection of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is doubly wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is great cheating, great cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In the name of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...one should not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difficulty. Everyone is doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. We have many propagations of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is preaching his own ideas and taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Under the umbrella of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> he does it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Smoking <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> with a friend's hand because there is smell, so the friend's hand will smell. (Hindi) (laughter) This is going on. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There will be immediate protest the moment... This film has got the connotation that Hare Kṛṣṇa means... Now, these boys, by their own conduct and by their own hard work, whosoever has come into contact with them have realized that this is genuine and actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you see, something cheating which is going on for long time, to stop it, it will take some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. Unless and until the people who are well-to-do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got one little test. You can also use that. Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So you make one test, whether he has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa. If he has not done, then he is in these four categories. What are they? <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina,</span> great sinful; <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> rascal; <span class="Italic">narādhama,</span> lowest of the mankind. And if you say, "Oh, these are so big, big learned scholar," now <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span> Why? <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam, asura. Asura's</span> business is to deny Kṛṣṇa and to kill Kṛṣṇa. So all these people, they are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and they are trying to kill Kṛṣṇa. (devotees chanting) Is it not a fact? All these big big leaders, they'll speak on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and they will never say that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You surrender to Him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> A friend of mine has surrendered to Cinmayananda. He says he is giving <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span> four hours a day, it is, not for surrendering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But not for surrendering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> "He is using the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span> for our day to life." I said to him, "Why? Why can't you (indistinct)," but not surrendering as Swamiji has said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they have made their own meaning. <span class="Italic">"Bhagavad-gītā</span> is not meant for surrender." Just see. (end)</div>
