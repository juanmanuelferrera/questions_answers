<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We will greet the Deities at seven o'clock this morning, so there will be no delay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, in America, in nearly all temples, the Deities are greeted at 7 o'clock. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...speak, why he is purchasing? They will cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He speaks a little Hindi. This is Asita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Asita. (man talking in Hindi in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go on. What is the trouble? See. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They stop everyone so they can extract taxes from them. They want to stop every single person, even the buffalo carts. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (to life member:) There was no trouble. It's okay now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a life member from Nellore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Nellore, Andhra Pradesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has come to live in our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> I am very fortunate that Swamiji has come from America. I was inquiring about you all these years. I wanted to come here in April also, when the temple was being opened. At that time I had some work; therefore I couldn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are doing there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> I am retired labor officer in the state government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So you can live here, retired life? Yes. You are welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> I'll be staying here for ten days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why ten days? Live here for ten years. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> If you please, I have no objections.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We want many educated men to understand this philosophy and preach. People are... Whole world, they are in ignorance-the value of life. <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are accepting this body as self. The whole trouble is there. So-called scientist, philosopher-everyone is thinking, "I am this body," and therefore there is so much trouble. They do not know what he is and what is his goal of life, how life should be molded. No knowledge. Therefore vigorous preaching is required. Our Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is that, that all people are suffering. There is little knowledge in India. So anyone who has taken his birth in India, he should make his life perfect by studying this Vedic literature and then spread the knowledge all over the world because they are in ignorance. Here also now they are ignorant. They do not know what is the value of life, thinking like cats and dogs. What is your idea about the value of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Unless it is very towards God, it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Constant thinking of Him, His lotus feet, it is the only way by which we can get the real benefit of getting this human life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And where is that education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> That is real education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... But where is that education? There is no such education all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Only great gurus like you can enlighten the whole world. Only very rarely such people come only for the benefit of the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but those who are leaders, those who are leading the people, they are not interested. They are misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> You can beg them (indistinct) everything nice with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Sometimes this side, sometimes that side. Near the head. (about fan?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> I not praising of Swamiji, I think no, so many saints are in India, so many great <span class="Italic">ṛṣis</span> are there. Nobody were able to propagate or bring this consciousness among the people of the worlds as you did. It is a great credit to India. That is what I feel personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Yes, I feel. In the heart of hearts I feel like that. I am very happy to see you and have your blessings. And I think that the whole world will be blessed or be benefited by your presence. I think we must take opportunity of utilizing your service and get benefit. That is what I feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that every Indian should do like that. I am only one Indian. If I can do as, according to your estimate, so much, so if every Indian does like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Unless he has been directed by God. He must be ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God is directing. This is the direction of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Only through you they will get that. Only people like you can relate with... It is dormant. The soul is there, and it is in a dormant stage. Unless it is kindled, it cannot have light. People like you can kindle them. And it is really our fortune that we are having Swamiji with us. There was some <span class="Italic">ṛṣi.</span> Even our Samanja Ācārya(?) or his guru, they were not able to carry this outside India. But you are able to, with all your... I think you are... Is it not said that you are an incarnation of God or you are deputy of God, is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Don't say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> You are deputy of God, and He is making you true. Swamiji will be staying here for another two months?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I wish to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Have you seen that land which has been given to us in Nellore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Yes, it is very near to me. You see, in Nellore, one lady has donated about ninety acres of land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> With a house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> With a house which will cost nearly four or five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> or even more. Very costly. And they also ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which season is good? I shall go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Yes, sir. You are welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When is a good time? When is the weather the best?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Best time is September, October. Of course, there will be little rain. In December generally it will be little chill, but not as chill as in the other parts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the best season?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Best season, from August to September. That is the best season. And I wish our guruji to visit our temple, Lord of Samhis(?) and you must see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara temple. That is the richest temple in the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bālajī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Bālajī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Oh. When did you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Last year or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, two years. A little more than one year. Hm? (everyone talking at once about rain)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's starting to rain, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can be near the temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> I think rain will not come. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is one house on that land, isn't there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> Yes, yes, one house on the land. And she wants to dedicate all of the property to the author of that books. That is the will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall organize it very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> And our Mahāṁśa Swami is taking very much interest. He is often coming to Nellore. (Hindi) Last month the land was registered and the registration took place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In the name of ISKCON?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It's already done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in September let us go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> And in October you can see about Bālajī's festival, ten (seven?) days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It is near?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Member:</span> It is about eighty miles from Nellore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rain is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes. We've had a lot of rain this last year, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (Heavy wind on microphone) (Sound of heavy rain) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was raining? That's it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">parikrama?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. That was to the old Yamunā trail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">British devotee (1):</span> The Yamunā's only five minutes walk from Raman Reti now, Prabhupāda. It's very nice for swimming. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...able to walk with us, why you have brought him? It will be strain for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The other day he came on the walk, the first day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The sands of Raman Reti where Kṛṣṇa and Balarāma would enjoy Their pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Therefore we have established Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The sands are very fine and soft here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sands are always soft. [break] ...old house. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> This is garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Acala-vihāra Gosvāmī. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> ...and down here where they're growing about two acres of <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> They just grow <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plants for the temples, for Bankibehari and other temples. The fragrance is so nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...built. Nobody living. Only locked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> This is where the gardener keeps his tools. [break] ...in there, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How this building could be constructed? [break] ...a strong-built wall, and the tree has grown from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> That means it must be very old wall, because now they are not building such strong walls. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhāballabha. [break] Real reminiscence of Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's a real what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reminiscence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In this area? [break] ...in the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book are like this. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It's a colony of birds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Babui(?). They create such nest, hanging nest. It is very nice fiber, fabricated. They know the art, simply by beaks. They have no hands. They want... They work only with the beaks, and you see the workmanship. Is our men going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes. Because the Yamunā is just close.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Very close down that way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Very fertile land. [break] ...used for mooring boats. Perhaps it was used for mooring boats when the river was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is said that Yamunā was navigable river. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I was just wondering how they were mooring boats to this thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's a frog that lives down there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think we shall return. I am getting tired. But how strongly built it is. You see? What was the mortar? Mortar, it is called? That is Madana Mohana temple. [break] ...also good <span class="Italic">datuna.</span>(?) They use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> What do they use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Datuna.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> For cleaning teeth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is good... For those who are soft gum, it is good medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Nim</span> leaves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, the sticks, twigs. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...auspicious to see a calf drinking milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But there is no milk. (laughter) [break] Somebody should give me daily one fresh <span class="Italic">nim</span> stem. Ask somebody. [break] Everything you have to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> I can learn from Brahmānanda Mahārāja. I can learn from Brahmānanda how to break it and make it ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, no. Prabhupāda will arrange that. You just bring the branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many <span class="Italic">nim</span> trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You were telling us last year about <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves being very good for the stomach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Would you like some? We can bring you some <span class="Italic">nim</span> leaves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, little paste. I can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mash it in like a <span class="Italic">nim</span> chutney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Mortar and pestle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Put anything else in it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. A small pill. It increases appetite. Which way? This way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...know how to make <span class="Italic">kichri?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. I made for you in Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So do it today. <span class="Italic">Kichri</span> and eggplant, fried, and some vegetables. That's all. I'll take between one, half past one. So begin about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Twelve-thirty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I shall go this way or that way? Whose, this garden? Where is our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Our temple is behind the trees. [break] Two trees in one. One tree is growing out of the other tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Why they have become two? Not from sentiment, but scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The seed must have been deposited in the bark and then taken root.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are different seed, different tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Individual. And the specific individuality is there in the seed. Even if you grow together they will come differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Same earth is there, same water, everything same. But the seed is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they will say "by chance." Chance. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There is also that phenomenon, they say, "identical twins." When two brothers are born together they say "identical twins."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Why does that happen, if there are two brothers who are identically looking the same in features?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not difficult. In the same tree, the same semen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Because the living entity had the same desire? Two living entities having the same desire for the same body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (Hindi) They are going to take water from Yamunā or some from well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> From a well. There's just a well around the corner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They are all going to Yamunā. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> That lady was from Manipur.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Viśvambhara lives here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...can... Very nice blackboard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Hut! Hut!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just... Why it is thrown away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
