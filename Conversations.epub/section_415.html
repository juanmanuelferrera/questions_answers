<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They spend so much money for spreading Christianity in this country. What we are spending in the foreign countries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> The last time in our state, in this (indistinct), sent thirteen (?) lakhs in America to provide one temples, Veṅkaṭeśvara temple and (Hindi) Vighneśvara temple there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America is a big place, three thousand miles, square miles. So I don't think any temple has been erected in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> No, it is proposed to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temple... Just like these Christian missionaries, they constructed so many churches. But those churches are now being closed. In London, I have got specific knowledge, hundreds of churches are no more being used as church. Some of them are being used as <span class="Italic">go-down.</span> And some of the churches have been purchased by other religious sect. We have purchased one church in Los Angeles. So opening temple is good but who will maintain the spirit of temple worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> That is by (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Therefore there must be side by side propaganda who can maintain the temples. (Hindi) Oh, this is <span class="Italic">anna-prasāda,</span> so I will take later on. (Hindi) That temple is being constructed under whose supervision?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> That Ganapati Sthapati, in our state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Sthapati is a temple engineer. He will lay out the plans as per the (indistinct) <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and as per the rules laid down for the construction all temples in India. No other (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has gone there? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Once he had been to New York. They are now preparing all these idols, etc. They will be sent by sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what Deity will be installed there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Lord Veṅkaṭeśvara, Subrahmaṇiya-sat(?) Swami, Gaṇapati, Vighneśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> And Pancai Tattva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pancai?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> He is Rasa,(?) Sūrya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">pañcopāsanā.</span> [break] He is <span class="Italic">Rāmānuja-sampradāya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> do not recommend <span class="Italic">pañcopāsanā.</span> In the Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> there is no <span class="Italic">pañcopāsanā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, these are built by Hindees (?) and other custom. This temple is giving only Vighneśvara and Veṅkaṭeśvara. But the construction of other temples, they are raising funds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, local money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. throughout India and also in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, they are raising funds for millions of years. (laughs) I know that. Birla about... Yes, about fifty years ago there was contemplation of, that Birla would construct a very big temple in London. But there was no temple at all. Now since I have gone, I have established two temples, not very big, but still one of the temple is on the seventeen acre of land. A little outside London. One big musician, George Harrison, he has donated that temple, fifty-five lakhs. And we have got one temple in rented house...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> 10:30 for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 10:30. What is the time now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> 9:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you prepare yourself to go. If <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> is there, why don't you take it? Finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We will take at noon time. We take now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, go and take. <span class="Italic">Prasāda prāpti-mātreṇa bhoktavyam.</span> Go and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> It is time, one hour. (end)</div>
