<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Mahārāja and his father, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. They wanted to preach. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu also wanted to preach. [break] ...book to many Western universities. MacGill University. He had a very strong desire to preach. Then he attempted little. Then his son, my Guru Mahārāja, he was entrusted. He also attempted. He sent his disciple to London. And he wanted me also. Therefore at the last stage of my life, at the age of seventy years (chuckles) I made an attempt that... Our predecessors, they wanted, and they wanted me also to do that. So my other Godbrothers they could not do very well. So let me try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And what is your relationship with the Ba'hai faith?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> The Ba'hai faith that also preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness? I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> You don't know of the Ba'hais? B-'-h-a-i?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have heard the name, but they are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughs) Not your kind, but they worship Kṛṣṇa. Not the same kind of consciousness, but they also worship Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> You don't know about the Ba'hai religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (To devotees) Do you know the Ba'hai?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They have more or less... They accept all religions, and part of their worship is Kṛṣṇa. They have the person of Kṛṣṇa. But the difference is that we accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whereas the Ba'hais...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That and many others, they also do that. They also worship Jesus Christ. That is... [break] We have no disrespect for anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And you've been rather successful in institutionalizing your religion, getting a large number of temples constructed or built or taken over, and a large number of followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why do you think you are so successful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think I am successful, but people say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughs) Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will be successful when everyone will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But in Western countries, where people have to adopt to the different style of dress and a different life-style altogether, it means that you're asking for a very large commitment from people, and yet they do it. Are you saying that it's the strength of what you're preaching, or are they unhappy with what they've found otherwise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they look very nice with this dress. Don't you appreciate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Uh, that wasn't in my question, That's... (laughs). Yes, I think it's very nice, I couldn't do it. I wouldn't shave my hair, and I wouldn't dress like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot sacrifice so much. They have sacrificed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Aḥ, I sacrifice up here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got a spirit of sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But you ask a great deal of people. So why do you think they're willing to give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I ask only four things: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. That's all. But these four things are very, very, difficult for the Western people. That I know. Just see. God consciousness cannot be achieved by any third-class man. One must be the topmost first-class man. Then he can become God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And who decides what is first class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is decided by Kṛṣṇa. Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Yeṣāṁ tu anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.</span> (Prabhupāda is coughing) Give me water. <span class="Italic">Te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says who can become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. That definition is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Translation: "Persons who have acted piously in previous lives and in this life, whose sinful actions are completely eradicated, and who are freed from the duality of delusion, engage themselves in My service with determination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is not very ordinary thing. <span class="Italic">Pāpam,</span> sinful life... At the present moment people are very, very much addicted to sinful life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are less intelligent; therefore they don't care for death even. Neither they have got any idea what is going to happen after death. Formerly, people were afraid of committing sin. They knew that "After death, I will have to suffer." Now, at the present moment, the rascals are so daring, they do not care what is sin, what is going to happen next life. They do not care. That means less intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> What's going to happen to <span class="Italic">you</span> in the next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My life? According to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> if we have actually developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are going to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may not, but they will go. (laughter) And even it is a failure, then the next life he is guaranteed human life and very nice life. You find out this verse, <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭaḥ sañjāyate. </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">prāpya puṇya-kṛtāṁ lokān<br class="calibre2"/>uṣitvā śāśvatīḥ samāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe<br class="calibre2"/>yoga-bhraṣṭo' bhijāyate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 6.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: The unsuccessful yogi, after many, many years of enjoyment on the planets of the pious living entities, is born into a family of righteous people, or into a family of rich aristocracy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even one is failure. And one who is successful? Then? <span class="Italic">Janma karma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">janma karma ca me divyam<br class="calibre2"/>evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma<br class="calibre2"/>naiti mām eti so 'rjuna<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.9]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Anyone who understands the transcendental nature of My birth and activities does not again return to this material world, but comes to My supreme abode."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is for the successful, and that is for the unsuccessful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And, while we're on success, how many people in India are becoming like these?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> As many as in the West, or more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Do you have more temples there than here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. We have got very... Recently we have very big temple. There are many other temples in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And what is your relationship with, say, the Ramakrishna Mission?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, we have no relationship. We don't accept them as any authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are not doing according to <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> They are doing whimsically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But they are doing very good social work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That social work has nothing to do with spiritual work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Does this organization do social work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the best social work. We are giving the best education, best knowledge, best hope of next life. And what they are giving? They do not know what is next life even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> When you do the translations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have all translated during these ten years. I translated, began translating from 1968, or '9, I was publishing that <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> paper even from my <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life, from 1944.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And when you do do the translation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then I began translating from 1968 or '69. And I published my first book in 1962. Then next was in 1964. And then the third volume was published in 1965. And then I came to America. And then I translated all these books, whatever you see, about fifty books. This is about eleven hundred pages. Other books are not less than four hundred pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Oh, yes. I have many in my shelf like these. Where and when did you learn English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta. I was educated in a college. My professors were all Europeans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr Copeland:</span> Which college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scottish Churches' College. You know that? In our time Dr. Watt, he was principal. And I was student of philosophy of Dr. W. S. Urquhart. He was my professor. And our English professor was Mr. Cameron,(?) Mr. Scrimgeour, Mr. Warren. And I was student of economics also. One Mr. Keith, he was also... All our professors were Scotsmen, Englishmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And after you left the college, were you employed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I was appointed manager of a very big laboratory, Dr. Bose's laboratory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I've heard of it. From another worker. While you were in the college or afterwards, did you participate in any political movements?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I joined this Gandhi's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> You did? Had you met Gandhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I met several times, but not as personal interview. But I liked his movement, national movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Young men, everyone likes politics. (Dr. Copeland laughs) Actually, later on, I did not like. When I was mature, when I met my Guru Mahārāja, then I thought all these things bogus. It has nothing, no value. Social movement, political movement, they are simply wasting time. Real movement is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why do you think a large number of people followed Gandhi? Why did they like him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, large number of people followed Lenin. They are not important. Neither Lenin is important, nor their follower is important. So I don't think Gandhi's followers are as many as Lenin's. So these things are not important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But don't you look upon him as a religious man? Gandhi, religious man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a politician. In the garb of. He consolidated the mass of Indian people, becoming a <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> but he was not a <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. According to... Just see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas mām...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to judge from this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Our test will be <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhajanty ananya-manaso<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation. O son of Pṛthā, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That-because you are student of history-Mahatma Gandhi's photograph with <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> Did he speak anything about <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> or Kṛṣṇa in the history of his life? Then how he is <span class="Italic">mahātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> People called him that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People call, that is another thing. That is the defect of the modern civilization, that <span class="Italic">vox populi.</span> The people may be asses; still, their votes are accepted. The people are trained up as the fourth-class, fifth-class men, and their votes are appre... This is the defect of the modern... They are not trained up as first-class men, and still, their votes are accepted. Therefore, even a very advanced country, America, there was mistake, Nixon. They elected him president. Then they dragged him down. That is the mistake. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not elect a first-class man, and later on, they could understand. So everywhere it is going on. <span class="Italic">Vox populi,</span> the people, are less intelligent. They do not know whom to vote. And besides that, votes can be purchased. They do purchase by paying according to the country. So what is the value of this vote?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Um, when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what is your opinion? A third-class, fourth-class man, if they vote, do you think it has any meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, I don't define the people first, second, third, and fourth class like you do, obviously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't find? You don't find first person...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, I'm not as willing to judge other people. I'm not willing to say whether you're first, second, or third class, just as I'm not willing to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. At least, you are educationist, you are professor. According to the modern society, you are one of the first-class men. Do you think your position and the lower class man, the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I think everybody has the same amount of intelligence and ability. It's just that some of them get more breaks than others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Everyone has got the potency, but unless he shows his intelligence, he has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, yeah, but a lot of people don't have a chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So those who have no chance to become first-class men, their vote, what is the value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> When you were coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to our Vedic civilization, first-class men's vote required, who knows things as they are. One who does not know things as they are, what is the use of taking vote from him? Our Vedic civilization, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> first-class men... The qualification of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> find out. <span class="Italic">Śamo damaḥ satyaṁ śaucaṁ titikṣā ārjavam, jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyaṁ brahma-karma...</span> Read.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Peacefulness, self-control, austerity, purity, tolerance, honesty, wisdom, knowledge, and religiousness-these are the qualities by which the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I'm not a first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I do not know, but if you have got these qualities... We have to judge by the qualities, not by birth. But since India accepted a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth without these qualities, India's civilization fell down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Ah, that's why. Ah! Pretty! Are you a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> By birth you're a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> yes. Yes. But we are not... We do not recognize <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> by these qualities. Anyone who has got... This is the shastric injunction, that if the qualities are found somewhere else-that means one who is not born in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family but he has the qualities of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>-then he should be accepted as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is shastric injunction. <span class="Italic">Yasya hi yal lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ varṇābhivyañjakam, yad anyatrāpi. Anyatra</span> means elsewhere. <span class="Italic">Tat tenaiva vinirdiśet</span> [SB 7.11.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> "He should be accepted as such." Similarly, if a man, born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family but he has the qualities of the <span class="Italic">śūdras... Paricaryātmakaṁ kāryaṁ śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">. Paricarya</span> means service. To accept... [break] So therefore, according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> nobody is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> should remain independent. He should live by his qualities. People will honor him. Just like we are training. We do not serve anyone, but we are maintaining big establishment.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> We do not serve anyone, any merchant, officer, any... No. We chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all. If Kṛṣṇa wants, He will give us food, or we shall starve. We are not going to serve. This is the proof. We are spending not less than twenty lakhs of rupees for maintaining our establishment throughout the whole world, but we do not know what is our next moment's income. We do not know... We have eaten today. We do not know whether we shall have any eatable next day. This is our position. If it is available, we shall eat; otherwise we shall starve. This is our position. Still, I don't seek any employment, "Give us some service to maintain our..." No, we don't do that. We never do that. When I was alone, I was not doing that. I was living alone. I had no income, no friend, no shelter. Since I left my home, since 1954, I never cared for anyone maintaining me. And there was no resource, fixed income, nothing of the sort. I depended on Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, in the whole society we are feeding daily ten thousand men.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">We have got about hundred centers. And we are maintained in Eu..., just like European, American standard, not vagabond standard. But still, we have no fixed income. Depend on Kṛṣṇa. If He wants, He will give us food; if He wants, we shall starve. This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> practical. And "Now I have got all degrees, and unless I get a good master, then I am street dog." (Dr. Copeland laughs) That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Without getting a master... Just like a street dog has no value unless he gets a good master. Then he can bark (Prabhupāda barks), "Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! I have got my master." And if he doesn't get a master, nobody cares for it, and he is lean and thin, here going, here going, that's all. This is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He has no power to live independently. That is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And you're training them to lead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa will supply everything. Be confident. This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> We don't depend. You see for the last ten years our institution going on. We don't depend on anyone else. If you contribute voluntarily, welcome, but we are not dependent on you. This is brahminical class of man. We don't... Find this: <span class="Italic">śamo damas tapaḥ śaucam.</span> What are they? <span class="Italic">Śamaḥ?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simplicity, honesty. <span class="Italic">Ārjavam</span> means even an enemy enquires from me, "What is your secret?"

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vijñānam</span> means practical application. If one believes God, Kṛṣṇa, and if he believes that Kṛṣṇa is giving food to everyone, even to the elephant and to the ant, then why shall I bother for my food? He must give me. If He is supplying food in the jungle, so many animals, and the elephant eats at a time forty k.g. foodstuff, and the ant within the hole of your room, he is also there. The lizard is there, the rat is there, the snake(?) is there. So Kṛṣṇa is supplying food to everyone. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That is God. He is supplying the necessities of life to everyone. So what I have done that He will not give me food? And I am engaged my life for His service. If I have no such confidence, then where is Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Why shall I flatter others for my food? So this is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's...</span> "I must have full confidence in Kṛṣṇa. And God is so able, so competent, that He can feed millions and trillions and unlimited number of living entities, and I have dedicated my life for Kṛṣṇa's service, and I will starve?</div>

<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Are there no torn clothes lying on the common road? Do the trees, which exist for maintaining others, no longer give alms in charity? Do the rivers, being dried up, no longer supply water to the thirsty? Are the caves of the mountains now closed, or, above all, does the Almighty Lord not protect the fully surrendered souls? Why then do the learned sages go to flatter those who are intoxicated by hard-earned wealth?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... Saintly person should depend on Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is not supplying cloth, all right, find out some torn, thrown-out cloth on the street. And food? Go to the tree. Take some fruit. And for water, go to the river. There is sufficient water. And for shelter, go to the cave. So these are already arranged. And above, over and above, do you think that the Supreme Lord does not take care of the person who has fully surrendered unto Him? Then why you are going to flatter this rich class of men for your food? This is the... And that is the... Especially throughout the history in India you will find, many hundred thousands of these <span class="Italic">sādhus.</span> They do not go anywhere. I have seen at Allahabad, Kumbha-melā. They take bath in the Ganges and sit down in their place, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, without caring wherefrom the food will come. They sit down. And everything is coming. Still in India, if there is information, even in the remotest villages, "There is a saintly person has come in the village," they will approach.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"<span class="Italic">Bābā,</span> what can I do for you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Have you done that? Have you wandered around from village to village?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not village to village, but town to town. Even in foreign countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughs) Even in Australia too. To get back more to the origins of the movement, why do you follow the teachings of Caitanya rather than say Vallabha or Rāmānuja or Rāmānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no difference. Rather, Caitanya Mahāprabhu's teaching is the summary of all Vaiṣṇava<span class="Italic">-</span>Rāmānuja, Rāmānanda, Madhvācārya, and Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbārka. There are four <span class="Italic">sampradāyas.</span> So Caitanya Mahāprabhu follows everyone. There is no difference much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Oh, you found. How about Kabhir?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kabhir is not in the <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is upstart. (Dr. Copeland laughs) He says <span class="Italic">mālāja pare śālā.</span>(?) He is abusing a person who chants Hare Kṛṣṇa. He is such a rascal. <span class="Italic">Mālāja pare śālā. Śālā </span>is abusive language. But he said <span class="Italic">mālāja pare śālā.</span> All the Vaiṣṇava<span class="Italic"> sampradāyas,</span> they chant the beads, and he is speaking <span class="Italic">śālā,</span> abusive language. How fallen he is! That is the difficulty, that our system is accepting the previous <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> authority. So anyone who does not follow this principle, he is upstart. He is not accepted as authority. So Kabhir is not an authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Does that mean you go back to Śaṅkarācārya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Śaṅkarācārya is also not authority because he does not follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Of course, Māyāvāda philosophy was there always, but that was never taken very seriously. Vyāsadeva is the authority. So Vyāsadeva is not Māyāvādī. He is Vaiṣṇava. We belong to Vyāsadeva's <span class="Italic">sampradāya, </span>Brahma-sampradāya. Therefore we worship our spiritual master as Vyāsadeva's representative, <span class="Italic">vyāsa-pūjā. </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And how about in the south? Do you have many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everywhere. South is the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Surely not as many as in the north, or as much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is the influence of the time. Otherwise, everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and anyone can follow. Either south or north, it doesn't matter. Or east and west. But if you don't follow, and still you say that "I belong to this <span class="Italic">sampradāya,"</span> that is another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> And when you translate the texts that you use, they come from Caitanya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> So you don't worry about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no worries. Because we have got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I don't have any worries either. (laughs) That's good.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because we follow the standard. Just like a small child. He follows his parents, and he knows, "My parents are there." Therefore he has no worries. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, no. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall remain like a child, being protected by our predecessor. Then there is no worries. And if you want to manufacture something of your concocted brain, then there is worries. Just like Gandhi. Gandhi wanted to prove nonviolence from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which is impossible. Therefore he had worries, because he wanted to prove something which is not in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and still, he took <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But my point is there are other texts as well as Caitanya's texts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> There are other texts, other <span class="Italic">Gītās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Other versions of the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> besides Lord Caitanya's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not authorized. Therefore we say specifically, "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It is,</span>" no interpretation. Here Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we preach that thing. We preach that "You be Kṛṣṇa conscious." <span class="Italic">Man-manāḥ:</span> "Always think of Me," Kṛṣṇa says. And we are teaching these disciples, "Always think of Kṛṣṇa." There is no difference. We don't create. And therefore it is successful. Others, they created their own concoction; it was never successful. Before me, so many swamis came to the Western countries. They were not successful. Not a single person was Kṛṣṇa conscious, in the history. In the history of the last two hundred years so many swamis are coming in the Western countries. They also speak on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but not a single person was Kṛṣṇa conscious. And since we have presented <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> hundreds and thousands. This is the proof, that they presented something concoction. It was, what is called, impotent.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">A impotent man having sex, he cannot beget children. He can enjoy that sex, but he cannot beget child. Similarly, these so-called swamis, they are impotent. They could not produce any child of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the proof. (To Amogha:(?)) So you reply him. Don't be innocent like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughs) You can't just say that they don't exist. They're there. And surely there were other people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is... That was... About hundred years ago Vivekananda came, and he stayed in New York, but these people... When I came, I asked, "What is...? Do you know Vivekananda?" They said, "No, we do not know." I had to find out, search out, where is Vivekananda's center. It was not very prominent. Nobody was going. So for hundred years they worked, this Ramakrishna Mission. They could not establish even half a dozen centers in America. And I established forty centers within six years. And in each center there is devotees not less than twenty-five, up to 225. In Los Angeles we purchased one church. The church was sold because nobody was coming. And since we have taken... If you sometimes go to Los Angeles, you will see it is packed always. The same people, the same church-why it is packed now? And why it was sold without any attendance? What is the difference? I have not brought these men from India; neither I brought that church from India. The church was there, and these people were there.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Before this movement, they were not going there, and now they have packed up. So what is your judgment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, when I first came in, I asked you why were you so successful, and you said, "I don't know how you measure success," and now you're measuring success by numbers, and that's not fair. That's not logical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, my standard of success is little different. Of course, this is success. Everyone is saying I am successful. So it is not unsuccessful. But my standard of success is little different. So even if it not fully successful, still, the results are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Ah, fair enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">payi-nukuta-nyāya.</span>(?) And when I find full successful, just imagine what is that. This is partial success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughing) That's called "touche."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the logic, that the partial success is this, and when it will be full successful, you cannot imagine that, what is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (Tape garbled) <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> I don't want to ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him some <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> One of the... Just from understanding, speaking to Amogha, is one of the doctor's dilemmas is that he is reading your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but his colleagues do not appreciate your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> so much. He, sometimes he is confronted with the people who are tending more towards the impersonal school of thought, I think, and they have criticisms of your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> So he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> That's why I was asking. To see how you would reply to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you think that Kṛṣṇa is speaking as person. What right you have got to say that He is imperson?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone, anyone. What Kṛṣṇa is saying, He is saying as a person. <span class="Italic">Aham.</span> You know the Sanskrit word? <span class="Italic">Aham,</span> "I," first person. So why these foolish interpreters, they interpret "imperson"? What right they have got? They have no right. Suppose you are teaching something from your own point of view. What right I have got to say that "This is not Mr. Such and such opinion. What I say, that is opinion"? Is that very good judgment? You are saying something from your point of view, and I poke my nose that "This should be spoken like this." Is this honesty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> It's a difference of opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why should you... I showed opinion on your book? If I have got opinion, I publish another book. Why should I interpret, why shall I poke my nose in your business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Yeah, but the dialogue is how you learn. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is most dishonest. Oh, yes. You cannot interpret my book in your own way. That is not allowed. No gentleman will do that. You, if you have got a different view, you put your view in your own book. Don't drag my book. That is honesty. And because my book is popular, you take advantage of my book, and you interpret in your own way... This is most dishonest. You cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> No, but when you have different types of things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different types we may have, but Kṛṣṇa's book, what Kṛṣṇa is saying, it should be presented as Kṛṣṇa says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Yeah, but then <span class="Italic">you</span> think that <span class="Italic">you</span> know what Kṛṣṇa says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I say, "<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Yeah, and other people think they know, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how they know? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> simple thing. Find out this verse. What is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> "Always think of Me and become My..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, Kṛṣṇa says, "Always think of Me." How you can say that "Don't think of Kṛṣṇa"? Is that very honesty? No, no, Kṛṣṇa may be wrong. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Ah, okay. I'll buy that. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot say that "Kṛṣṇa says something else." Kṛṣṇa says, "Always think of Me." So we have to present that "Kṛṣṇa says, you always think of Kṛṣṇa." That is honesty. And if I say, "No, no, you don't think of Kṛṣṇa," that is dishonesty. That is dishonesty. We are fighting against that. Why should you poke your nose in the statement of Kṛṣṇa? If you have got different views, you put your own book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Mmm, we're not really arguing about the same thing. I'm saying that if, say, somebody says Christ in the Bible says something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must say that "Christ says like this." That is honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Yeah, okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you say, "No, no, what Christ says it is wrong. What I am saying, it is right." Then it is dishonest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Mohammed says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone. Mohammed says something. You have to say, "Mohammed says this." You cannot say, "What Mohammed says, it is not right. What I say it is right." You cannot say that. That is dishonest. You say in your own words. Why should you bring Mohammed or Kṛṣṇa or Christ to say your words? Did they come to support your views?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> No, I don't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you do not do that. You do not do that. You will see Dr. Radhakrishnan says. When this, he is making comment on it, he said, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto māṁ namaskuru,</span> and Dr. Radha..., he says "not to Kṛṣṇa." How he is misleading people! He is a great scholar, and he says "It is not to Kṛṣṇa, to the person." Just see. This dishonesty is going on. What right he has got to say like that? Did He, did He, Kṛṣṇa, left His <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to be interpreted by a rascal, "Not to Kṛṣṇa"? This is rascaldom. You cannot say. You must say what Kṛṣṇa says, if you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But if you have got a different views, then you write your own book. Present, as many others philosophers are doing. I don't agree with you. You don't agree with me. That's all right. <span class="Italic">Nāsau munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.</span> You cannot become a big philosopher unless you have got a different views. That is the way. If I don't defy you, then I am not a big philosopher.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That is the way. It is going on. So <span class="Italic">nāsau munir yasya...</span> So if I take the opinion of one <span class="Italic">muni</span> and another <span class="Italic">muni,</span> another <span class="Italic">muni,</span> then where is the real view? Therefore it is said <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> Big personalities, what they have done, we have to follow that. So our principle is that, that we are following Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> a great personality. Or the Christians are following Christ, a great personality. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.</span> You follow some <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> great personality. Don't take opinion, this man, that man, this man, this man. Then you will be bewildered. <span class="Italic">Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyāṁ mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ.</span> So you have to follow one great personality, <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> That is also recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhā... ācāryopāsanam,</span> following the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> So we have got recognized <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> just like you said, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Or Śaṅkarācārya even. You follow one <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> like Christians, they follow Christ, <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The Mohammedans, they follow <span class="Italic">ācārya,</span> Mohammed. That is good. You must follow some <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> But don't give your opinion. That is our process. <span class="Italic">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam.</span> Just see, find out.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. As soon as you give up the <span class="Italic">ācārya-paramparā</span> system, then it is lost. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> will say like that, Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya. And Dr. Radhakrishnan, "No, no, it is not to Kṛṣṇa." Just see the fun. He has become more than the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> So we reject immediately.

But neither... <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti:</span> "If one man accepts, then he can become the bright moon." <span class="Italic">Na ca tārāḥ sahasraśaḥ:</span> "The so-called stars has no value." One moon is sufficient. So our preaching is: Let one man understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> We don't want disciples. I never collected disciples. I never compromised that "You can do whatever you like, and you become my disciple. "No. You have to follow this. Now also, this morning, I accepted so many... "First promise whether you are going to do this. Then I initiate." This is my policy. If I would have said, "No, you can do whatever you like, and give me some money. I shall give you <span class="Italic">mantra,</span>" then you would have seen millions. But I accept very selected disciple, not that anyone, everyone comes, and I accept disciple. No. He is first of all trained up six months. Then, when he is able to promise to follow the regulative..., then I accept. This is stricture. It is not that everyone comes, "Give me thirty-five dollars. I give you <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and within six months you become God." I do not do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> You should add humor to honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He said as one of the qualifications, we should add good humor, to honesty. He says you have good humor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. One who has got knowledge, he is humorous also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Ah. (laughs) Oh. Well, what do we do now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasāda. Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajāyate.</span> Take the whole plate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Take the whole plate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Don't miss out on <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> leaf. You can take it home with you. Have it for breakfast. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Now we'll try and tell him I didn't really disagree with him or with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I don't disagree that when you say the texts that you follow is the text that you believe in. All I'm saying is that there are other texts, and surely there would be some value in studying the other texts. But he's disagreeing with that, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I was reiterating the point that we only follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> and there is maybe a slight different approach within the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> but the conclusion is the same. The conclusion is that we must surrender to Kṛṣṇa. And we don't place too much value in people who are commentating on the scriptures who don't follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> We don't place that much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to receive the knowledge through <span class="Italic">paramparā,</span> disciplic succession. "And because the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> is broken, therefore it is lost," Kṛṣṇa says. So we cannot accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> or any Vedic literature, which is called <span class="Italic">śruti... Śruti</span> means one hears from the <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> That is the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Usually in modern education they have the idea called "well-rounded point of view." They want to take some from here, from there, from that one and that one, that one, and then think about them all, and come up with a conclusion. So he is thinking it doesn't fit with their pattern of reasoning, how we take from one source and get the proper conclusion. They think they have to get from many sources and compare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How... I can reply that if you want to know who is your father, then you will have to take the knowledge from many sources, by votes, that who is your father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> (laughing) It's not the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now he says, "not the same." You cannot offer reason. You have to take from one source, from the mother. That's all. You cannot take votes, "Can you say who is my father?" He will say this... He'll say, "He is your father." No, it is not the way. The way is to take the information from the right source, not take the votes of rascals and fools. That is not the way. One source. Even from scientific point of view, mathematics, "two plus two equal to four," you have to take from one source. Any mathematician will say like that. Nobody will say, "No, two plus two equal to five." "No, two plus two equal to three." Nobody will say. "Two plus two equal to four," everyone will say. This is not the way of securing knowledge, from here, there... Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not approve. And our Kṛṣṇa, He said, <span class="Italic">imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the recommendation. And because that source is now missing, therefore it is lost. This process of knowledge, that we take knowledge from anyone and everyone, his opinion, what is that?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Not that everyone is in knowledge, but everyone can give his opinion. That is a different thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> That was my point, only that. Everybody should have an opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has got his opinion, that is different thing. But not that everyone has got the knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Well, that's why we come to you, for knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> But I come to you for knowledge, and then I go to other people for knowledge too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you go, but if you want real, right knowledge, then you must approach the man who knows right, not that you find out anyone and everyone and find out</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> I'm done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I'll give you a show around if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Okay, fine. I thank you very much for your time. And when do you come back again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> When do you come back to Australia again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> January. Hopefully in January. Will session be in then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Oh, no, that won't work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> When is session?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Session will end in October and start again in March. But if when you come back in January, they tell me that you're here, I'll come talk to you again if you want to talk to me again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You are always welcome. Educated man like you is welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> Oh, yes. (laughs) Keep up the good humor. (Devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Copeland:</span> <span class="Italic">Namaskāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody else was to come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I think one more was to come. (Devotees talk amongst themselves in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> So he "had to run."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He said at the end, "I am done." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah, he said, "I am done."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It means that you have finished him. (Prabhupāda laughs) They are... They have such a misunderstanding of the philosophy coming from India. When they come to see you they think that you will be very liberal-minded because they have received this liberal-mindedness from so many other bogus swamis, and when they come to see you, you are very conservative. You will not accept anyone else. So they cannot agitate their mind. They cannot do their <span class="Italic">muni</span> thing. So many other swamis come, and they accept this, accept that, do this, and do that, and simply stress, "The follower is right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will say to him, "Love humanity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is very palatable. "Oh, Swami is for humanity." He is a rascal, he does not know. "Love humanity. Do not love Kṛṣṇa. Love humanity." And then people believe him. "By loving humanity, you love Kṛṣṇa or God." These things are very palatable. This is Vivekananda's philosophy. And most people say like that. "Love humanity." Oh, why humanity? Why not tiger? That they shall not. All bogus. Don't be misled by the bogus. Stick to your own principles. That's all. People may come or may not come. We don't care for them. We must speak the right truth. Why "people not coming"? People are not coming? We are getting more and more devotees. (end)</div>
