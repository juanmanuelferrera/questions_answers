<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll come like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The road must be bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Two lanes. They'll probably have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within that temple, there will be the tree of planetary system, electric bulb, and they'll move round. And upon that, sun will run. That requires electrical mechanism. [break] ...all side, other, different planets, Vaikuṇṭha-loka.... There will be escalator to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I think in some of the Western countries they have these elevators with brass windows all around, so that one can, even though he's going up, he still sees all around. It would be very fascinating for these people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What to speak of escalators?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What to speak of escalators?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> And that light system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> People will pay just to get on that escalator every day. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In Los Angeles they have installed a speed walk at the airport, an escalator that you can walk on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are not going to Calcutta? Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I was going to go in a day or two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is no news? [break] Of course, if there is devotee. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I was thinking perhaps this year to begin with one car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. Last year, Philadelphia, there was one car. Oh, crowd was.... Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> If there's no Jagannātha Deities we can use...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Has to be Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't try to manufacture ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Most.... Most of our temples, we have no Jagannātha Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Anyway, it will be arranged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> You can get some Jagannātha Deities here in India, big ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, that's not very difficult to do. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...men came to see <span class="Italic">pandal</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone who came saw the <span class="Italic">pandal.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There was a big crowd going in constantly, a river of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was impossible to walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Next year the Chinese men must come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Chinese <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Chinese and Russian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Russian, you cannot distinguish, but Chinese can be distinguished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From the face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Just like the Manipur people come sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is same stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Manipur, Chinese, Cambodian stock. [break] Many Chinese, for culture. I know. All came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they invite you to China, you'll go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, certainly. I can go immediately. I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> [break] Everyone was chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa and saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Crowd also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Yeah, the crowd here.... There was practically.... I didn't see any incidents of anybody doing anything wrong or trying to cause trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Jayapatākā Mahārāja just said he was measuring the people as they came in. In one minute, an average of a 150 people came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was only low time. And peak time was 400.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Per minute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Per minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many visitors, according to your calculations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So that's about between 9,000 to 25,000 an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They averaged fifteen or twenty thousand an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Per hour. Then they, all day they're coming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So yes, well over a <span class="Italic">lakh.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Two <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Last night was big. Last night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the police officer said that "From all different parts of Bengal, they are coming to see your temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This never before has happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> We realized last night our temple is too small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> And the road, you could not even walk down it. It took me fifteen minutes to get to the gate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I therefore planned four buildings like that. You know. And that was my plan, four buildings like that besides temple and my house. That was the original plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> There was one Kṛṣṇa-kṛpā Brahmacārī. You met him a few years ago, told him to come here, and he saw the <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> room. He said he has never seen such a well-organized <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> room, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution. Everyone was very well disciplined and what-not. He was very impressed. He'll be coming today at five p.m. He was a physics professor at some college in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, all this credit goes to Jayapatākā Mahārāja. Yes. He is struggling from the very beginning. Others who were in the beginning, they have all gone away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> He was the first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Only your mercy, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You are always keeping...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So supply nice food, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This new building is equal to three buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The new building is equal to three of these buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not so broad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> But it is six times as long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> But there's still space...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Five times as long...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> But there's still space around to build.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five times?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Six times as long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About six times longer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And it's.... This building, including the grounds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So this, at least two buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This building, including the grounds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it is not going to be four stories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No. But five times as long, and two story. That means ten sides. On this, they got eight sides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This, this building actually only has three floors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not four floors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So in that way, it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That one has two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Half of it's kitchen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This one has three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are floors, ground floors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That also has three, if you count the ground floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that's three, plus six times longer</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...just decorate green leaves and yellow flower. By chance? Rascals say, "By chance." It is coming by chance? Just see. Show me anything within your experience which has come by chance. Anything, whatever you like, show me, come by chance, which has come by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I can say.... "Yes, I was, became sick by chance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "I became sick by chance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Then again you are rascal. You infected some disease. Then you became sick. There is no chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I went in the shower, and I turned on the shower, and the thing broke and hit me on the head. It was chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because you are rascal, therefore it hit you.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So it was chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was not chance. You are a rascal, and you were hit on the head.... (laughs) That is not chance. The cause is your rascalism. So you cannot find out anything by chance. Madhudviṣa Mahārāja, you can find out anything by chance? This is simply rascaldom, chance theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What about...? What about gambling, Prabhupāda? Somebody wins; somebody loses. That's by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They would say, "Everything is by chance." You say green, yellow flower with green leaf. So.... But through evolution there has been so many other combinations. Now we're just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then evolution is the cause. Then evolution is the cause. How you can say "chance"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, it's just many, many different combinations. Now you are seeing the yellow and green...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...so you are appreciating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a process in the evolution. Therefore you find. You cannot say it's chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Well the evolution happens by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Just like he said. All the trees are growing up, not one going this way, not by chance one is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Nothing by chance. It is a wrong theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If you throw dice, they may come up in one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then dice becomes cause? Chance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, what causes it to be seven or eleven or another number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not chance. You do not know. Therefore you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Ah! Because they don't know, they say "chance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> That's right, because I don't know, ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They want to cover their ignorance by this theory, "chance." They want to become very intelligent by chance. That is their.... That is not the fact. For intelligence you have to learn from a superior person. It cannot be done by chance. Who has become learned scholar by chance? There is none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because that is <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> philosophy, this chance philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone has to work very hard, pass examination, and then he becomes an educated man. Where is by chance one has become learned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What about two people born in the same circumstance? Each has equal education and equal background, but one becomes rich and one remains poor. That's chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the fate. Fate is the cause, destiny. Otherwise, so many people are working hard. Why not everyone is becoming rich by chance? <span class="Italic">Kālena sarvatra gabhīra-raṁhasā.</span> This is the instruction in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam. Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham.</span> There are two things-happiness and distress-and they are being controlled by the time. You have infected some disease. In time, it will come out, manifested, and the doctor say, "Oh, you infected this disease. Take this injection." The time factor. It.... You have to wait to see the result. It is not chance. As soon as you do something, immediately the reaction begins. But you do not see the result immediately, but wait and you'll find. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So we say that everything has a cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But then we have causeless mercy. So would that be chance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We have also causeless mercy, meeting the pure devotee. Is that a chance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I.... We don't accept that chance. The causeless is a mercy. Causeless mercy is the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. The mercy is the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The mercy may be causeless, but the mercy is the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But the which is the cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The mercy is the cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You did nothing to deserve it, but it's caused your good fortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That poet from Ireland asked you, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you were in Rome. He said, "I want to know who told God all that He knows, because..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He asked, "Who.... Who has informed God of all knowledge? Everyone has to learn from someone." So he said, "Who informed God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Then Prabhupāda said, "First you have to know what <span class="Italic">God</span> means."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, that He's <span class="Italic">svarāṭ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think that poet was convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes. He admitted that he was confused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This philosophy pervades all of modern science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This chance theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that "By chance, after some time..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have finished their science. They have researched and done so many years now, their scientific knowledge is liquidated. Now they are giving this chance theory, therefore, because they cannot explain anything. That's all. Their <span class="Italic">vidyā</span> <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> is finished. That is the problem now. For the scientists, it is a problem now. Now, so far their limited knowledge is concerned, they have done everything, discovered everything. Now there is no scope of working and discovering. That is the position of the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So they should come to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is another thing. Rut this is their actual position. Now their position is how to bluff and get money, because talk is finished. Now bluffing stock is now finished. Now they have to give theories like this "chance" and make big, big words, jugglery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why don't they make research into consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they'll be finished? Whatever their limited knowledge they possess, that is finished now. They have no scope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They should look to the field of consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> They are doing it now, but they are studying the brain. They think the brain is the source of consciousness. So they study people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So wherefrom the brain came? What they'll answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> Well, it has evolved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again by chance. "Brain became by chance." That means failure of their stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dharmādhyakṣa:</span> I heard one professor in Berkeley...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you prepare brain, or keep something that by chance there will be a brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Make a monkey's brain by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> in one of your purports, you mention that great scientists like Einstein, Newton and Chandra Bose had such great brains, but who has created their brain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This is a very clever argument of Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> That they will not research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are appreciating the brain of big, big scientist. But who has created that brain? No appreciation. Just see how fool they are. You cannot create that brain. You create another contemporary brain like that big, big man. Even that big man cannot. The big men, before dying, he should have considered, "Now I'll die now. Let me create another brain like me, and that will work." That they cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So they think chance.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> There is actual proof, Prabhupāda, that when these scientists and great, so-called poets, when they die, refusing to admit the authority of God, they die a very terrible death. Just like in France there used to be a great philosopher named Voltaire, and at the end of his life, because his whole writings and existence he tried to disprove the existence of God, he went insane, and he was eating his own stool and urine. And a priest came to him and said, "Why don't you accept the existence of God? You have become such great poet." He said, "I will never accept the existence of God." But he became to the point where he was eating his own stool and urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>

And the other friend said, "No, it was by scissor." So they went on.... One said, "No! It is knife." He said, "No! It is scissor." So the knife man was very strong. So he took him to the water, that "You say it is knife. Otherwise I shall drown you." (laughter) So he said, "I'll never say." Then he said.... When he was drowning, he was doing like this, (Prabhupāda gesticulates) (laughter) "Scissor, scissor." When he was actually drowned and he had no other means to say, then he was doing like this: "It is scissor. It is scissor." This is their argument. However punished they may be, they'll do this.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you asked me the question, "Is there vitamins in the grass?" And obviously there's not such vitamins in grass that it produces milk. So the vitamins are coming from Kṛṣṇa? Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because if you eat grass, considering that there is vitamins-"There is indeed"-then you'll die.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cows are eating grass, dry grass, and giving you nice milk. Now, if you eat it-"There is vitamins. Let me eat"-you'll die. So who made this arrangement?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If the cow is given good feed, then the milk is much better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I.... That I admit. But one thing is that you practically see the cow is eating dry grass and giving you full of vitamins milk. So that does not mean that dry grass is the cause of vitamins? Otherwise you could eat also the dry grass instead of purchasing vitamin pills. Your country is very much fond of vitamin pills. You eat grass. Why you are after vitamin pills? Hm? Saurabha Prabhu? You can take vitamin pills with grass?</div>
