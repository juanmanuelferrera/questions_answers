<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...get money, they will spend it for spoiling himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nayanābhirāma:</span> So I was just wondering if it wouldn't be better if we gave them food and clothing instead of paying them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they will not work. [break] ...gradually. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...Who does not deviate from the instruction of the Lord, he is Aryan. All others, non-Aryan. The Aryans will take the words of God as it is, without any deviation. That is Aryan. An Aryan means advanced, advanced in knowledge, and one who is advanced in knowledge, he is advanced civilized. Rascal fools, how they can be civilized? Everyone is claiming "Aryan," but he does not know what is the business of Aryans. Simply by some bodily feature... The same ignorance-"I am this body." So by the bodily features they settle up: "This is from Aryan family; this is from non-Aryan family." That is good. That is external. Real Aryan means one who is advanced in knowledge and goes by the order of Kṛṣṇa, or God. (aside:) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Adolf Hitler adopted the idea of Aryan, but his criteria for Aryan was one who had blond hair and blue eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is bodily. (chuckles) That is another foolishness. Just like we have dress. So this dress of <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is not all. I must be real <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> in knowledge, in education, in behavior, not that... Hitler studies by the dress. That is the foolishness. It is not by the dress, but by the quality. Dress is also required. As I am <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> I cannot dress otherwise. That is also essential. But if one judges, "Here is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span>" then he'll misled. That is being done. People are being exploited in the dress of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> although actually he is not <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> That is also stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> "A <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> or a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> will be accepted by the outward feature." If somebody has got a thread only, two paisa worth, he becomes a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And when one takes a <span class="Italic">daṇḍa,</span> he becomes a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> This will be the identification in the Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So the Ramakrishna philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramakrishna philosophy is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I know. (laughter) They say it doesn't matter what kind of dress you wear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But "They say..." They are rascals. They can say anything. <span class="Italic">Chagale ki na khaya pagāle ki na bale:</span> "A madman, what does he not say, and a goat, what does he not eat?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's their philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have to take philosophy from the <span class="Italic">ācāryas. Ācāryopāsanam.</span> They are not <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> neither they follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> They do not follow any <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> either Śaṅkarācārya or Madhvācārya or Rāmānujācārya. They have their own philosophy. <span class="Italic">Ācārya,</span> the Ramakrishna, he used to worship Goddess Kali, but even they do not do that. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No. They don't even have deity worship even to Goddess Kali. They are so advanced...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So where they stand? They have no platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> What do they do, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They have one candle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Oh, yes. I went to that, one candle, once. They were just playing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they have established Ramakrishna's <span class="Italic">mūrti?</span> If they worship candle, then why they install Ramakrishna? That is the flaw. They have no standard of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Ānanda Prabhu was mentioning that he was speaking to one of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> of the Ramakrishna mission, and they were very concerned because a lot of their disciples were leaving the mission and joining our society. They were very concerned. Their society is not at all expanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That was begun long ago. For their hospital, formerly... (bell ringing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla (in distance):</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Retired medical practitioners, they used to join. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. But nobody is joining now. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśāla:</span> <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena...</span> [Bg. 4.34]. (etc.) (end)</div>
