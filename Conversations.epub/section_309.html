<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ. Dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you can quote <span class="Italic">ślokas,</span> that will be first-class. In India especially. In your country they do not care. Our Bhavānanda Swami, because he could not quote <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> so he was saying, "Oh, because you have quoted some <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> it is authorized?" He was saying like that. Western people, they cannot imagine that by quoting a Vedic version it becomes immediately authorized. They cannot imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't accept that source of authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't accept any authority. Therefore they are changing Bible also, according to their whims. They don't accept authority. Therefore father, son, goes out of home. This is the basic principle of western civilization. They don't accept any authority. Everyone is his own authority. Now that contamination has come here. And nobody can be authority also, because if I accept somebody authority, he has not followed authority, so how he can be authority? Do you follow? Suppose if somebody respects his father, but father never followed any authority. So actually father is not authority. What do they say, authority? Organized religion? They protest organized religion? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yeah, they protest organized religion. Anything in the society, Catholic Church...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So nobody's now actually... This Christian world, they do not care for any pope. Hm. What do you think? And what is this pope? He's simply a post. He has no knowledge. Otherwise how he can tolerate? People are going against Bible. But the Pope does not understand that the in the Bible clearly it is said, "Thou shalt not kill." If he does not understand the simple truth then how he can become the head of his... So what is interpretation of the pope?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, they say that animals have no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Such rascals, they are leaders. How much imperfect that institution is. But if you say, then they will be angry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, one girl, she is Hindu, but she is studying in a convent. And they were catching butterflies in the garden. So the head sister said, "No, don't harm them because they are God's creatures." So she said, "Well, why do you eat meat?" So the sister left, but she failed her. She failed her in her classes. She gave her a failing grade, because she spoke back to her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It means they have no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No philosophy. No authority, no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> If they say, "One living entity has soul and another living entity doesn't," what is the difference? What is the principle of movement, they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that idea? I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The girl embarrassed the sister by saying that "You say that we shouldn't harm these insects, but you eat meat." So the sister didn't say anything, but on the girl's examinations and during her classes the sister gave her failing marks, in spite of her, to cut down her outspokenness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Failing marks? Means less...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, she failed her in the class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Because she asked, "Why do you eat meat?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> She couldn't answer her philosophically, so she got back by failing her.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there are so many members of the society against cruelty to animals. But they are all meat-eaters. Read something from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and discuss. So in the Nepeansea Road, whether regular other things are going on or not? Or simply it is going out and coming and eating and sleeping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we want to have morning class and Monday, Wednesday and Friday have evening program there, evening discourse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether it is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we just fixed up the place. The day you arrived was the first day it was painted. Until then, it was not fit for anyone to come in. It was very nasty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are living since a long time there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have been living, but we have not invited others there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you invite others or not, whether your program was going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, till then it wasn't, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it was simply a joint mess, that you go and collect and come and eat and sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very dangerous. Then you will all fall down. If you make a joint mess, if you go and collect something and then eat and sleep, then everything will be... Therefore I do not want to keep separate. The temple worship means there will be regulative principles, that you will have to rise early in the morning, you have to attend class, <span class="Italic">kīrtana...</span> These things, as soon as you give up all these things, zero. Then it will be like <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> as they are, hard labor, collecting money, and enjoying senses. That's all. So that is the pitfall everywhere. In the church, temple, as soon as they get some nice income, then in the name of "priest," <span class="Italic">"sādhu,</span>" <span class="Italic">"sannyāsī,</span>" they do the same thing. Therefore Gosvāmīs, they left everything. That is the danger of <span class="Italic">viṣaya, viṣaya</span> touch. <span class="Italic">Viṣaya chāḍiyā se rase majiyā.</span> As soon as we give up this <span class="Italic">śravaṇam, kīrtanam,</span> then it becomes <span class="Italic">viṣaya.</span> <span class="Italic">Viṣaya</span> means materialism. There is no spiritualism. <span class="Italic">Kṣurasya dhārā, kṣurasya dhārā. Kṣura</span> means sharpened razor. If you are careful, you cleanse very nicely. If you are not careful, immediately blood. Immediately. So the spiritual life is like that. As soon as you become little inattentive, immediately <span class="Italic">māyā</span> captures, "Yes, come on." Then everything failure. We have got the tendency to enjoy sense. So senses are strong. As soon as there is opportunity, the senses will take advantage immediately. Then your whole business finished, Choṭa Haridāsa, and rejected by Mahāprabhu, "Get out." Even associate of Caitanya Mahāprabhu failed, personal associate. So there is chance of falling down even from the personal association of God. Jaya-Vijaya, they had to become demons. So these are the... If we do not follow strictly our regulative principles, routine work, then the whole scheme will be failure. Then, instead of Christianity, it will be "churchianity." You know this word, "churchianity?" You know? Yes. Everywhere this churchianity is going on. And the real aim is how to enjoy sense, under different cover. That is going on all over the world. Therefore it has come to that Rajneesh. Ramakrishna Mission, Rajneesh mission. Vivekananda has given preached, <span class="Italic">Yata mata tata patha,</span> Rajneesh also, a <span class="Italic">mata.</span> They have got also followers. Everyone can manufacture his own way of religion. So sense enjoyment, there is free field. This material world means sense enjoyment. But spiritual life means no sense enjoyment, <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyam.</span> Sense enjoyment is there even in the hogs. Then where is the difference between man and hog? The man means the more he has denied sense enjoyment, he is advanced. Otherwise the spirit of sense enjoyment there is in the hogs. That is the difference. <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> These ordinary men, they are working so hard, but what is their aim? The aim is sense enjoyment. So keeping the point, sense enjoyment, in view, there is no difference between hogs and human beings. Because they are also working day and night, hogs. A particular animal has been mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke.</span> This <span class="Italic">ayaṁ deho nṛloke,</span> in the human society, is not meant for working so hard simply for sense enjoyment because this spirit is visible even in the hogs. Then what it is meant...? <span class="Italic">Tapaḥ. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the point. <span class="Italic">Śamena, damena. Satya-śaucābhyām.</span> Everything is there. And there are different types of sense enjoyment: <span class="Italic">rūpa, rasa, gandha, śabda, sparśa,</span> six kinds. And each sense, there is an object of sense enjoyment. There is eyes, oh, beautiful woman, sense enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Maithunam,</span> sex life, there are eight kinds of sex. If one thinks within the mind about sex enjoyment, that is also sex. So anyway, that is the danger, keeping a separate department for money collecting. Then it will turn: "Collect money, eat nicely and sleep nicely." And to live in the temple, at least, one is forced to rise early in the morning, take bath, to have <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> They'll get regulated life. Therefore this temple worship is needed because we are so impure. So at least, in temple, by following the regulative principles, we can keep ourself pure. Otherwise simply chanting is sufficient. There is no need of constructing big, big temples. But we are so impure... That is Jīva Gosvāmī's, recommended that as soon as we give up this temple worship method, regulative principles, then we become, in the dress of so-called, we become victim of <span class="Italic">māyā. Veśopajīvaka.</span> They are working and doing some business, and then our dress will be a means of business. This will be also another material business. Actually they are doing so. So that is the danger of keeping a separate department. What is the use? We have got jeeps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Still... The danger is very much there, I see that. But there is a use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if the danger is there, why should we accept such use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can we overcome that danger? We can try to overcome that danger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot ever overcome, because you are all weak. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless you are very strong, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is very, very stronger than you. How you can avoid it? <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā, mām eva ye prapadyante.</span> Only one is very, very strong in capturing the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa, he can avoid. Otherwise it is not possible. All these Villa Parle, Juhu gentlemen, they are daily coming to their city business. And is it very difficult for us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have an office, though, in the city where they come to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Office means their business is office. But your business is begging. Your business is not office. Your business is not... They have to direct so many things from there. That we can do. Besides that... Anyway, even they have got office, they come from in Bombay, Calcutta, even from hundred miles away. So if there is no such program, Deity worship, regulative principles, then it will be a joint mess. Hotel. Transcendental hotel. And transcendental fraud. This will go on. The business will be transcendental fraud, and life will be transcendental hotel. [Break] ...twenty, twenty-five. So these women devotees, they are given <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> by the <span class="Italic">bābājīs. Kṣurasya dhārā.</span> Actually it is like that. A sharpened razor, A little inattention, immediately blood. <span class="Italic">Kṣurasya dhārā niśitā duratyayā durgaṁ pathas tat kavayo vadanti</span> (?). That is the risk. Nowadays modern civilization, as we are accepting, there is jeep, there is telephone, everything is there. One can conduct his activities from anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it didn't work last time. They stopped their preaching. The last time everyone moved to Juhu, they completely lost contact with all the life members in the city because they found it very difficult to continuously go back and forth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So keep it just like a temple. Not that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Nepeansea Road downtown, it should be kept like a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The temple routine work must go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But no Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deity, there is picture. That's all right. Do you think that picture is not Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are eight kinds of Deity. Picture is also Deity. Even the thinking of Kṛṣṇa within the mind, that is also Deity. But we are not so expert that within the mind we can worship the Deity. Just like yesterday I gave you the example, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He was worshiping Deity within the mind. There was no temple, no Deity. But within the mind, everything he was doing. And he got salvation. So that depends on particular person, how to worship Deity. So far we are gross men. So we must have Deity worship. Otherwise you can worship Deity anywhere, sit down and think, just like this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> was thinking. Because Kṛṣṇa is available in any way, because He is everything. But the method must be there. <span class="Italic">Bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> So mind is also another material thing. So if you think of Kṛṣṇa's form within the body, mind, it is as good as you worship the Deity in the temples made of brass or wood or stone. Because both of them are Kṛṣṇa's energies. So whatever possible, He can accept. And that is Kṛṣṇa. Because Kṛṣṇa's energy. Therefore the energy is not different from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa can accept your service in any of these material. So-called material. Actually there is no material things. Material things means the desire for sense gratification. That is material. <span class="Italic">Ātmendriya-prīti-vāñchā-tāre bali 'kām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc.</i> <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 4.165]<span class="Italic">.' </span>That is material. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇendriya-prīti-icchā dhare 'prema' nāma. </span>That is spiritual. So that picture, that must be kept in a nice altar, regularly <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and everything should go on. (pause) [break] <span class="Italic">mūḍha's</span> position. Vyāsadeva has given Kṛṣṇa's pastimes in the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Nine canto are devoted for understanding Kṛṣṇa, beginning from <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> The Supreme, what is Parabrahman? <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> This is beginning. That Kṛṣṇa is personally explaining Himself in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> What <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> has described, what is Kṛṣṇa simply... <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1]. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Here also, this Vīrarāghavācārya says in (indistinct) <span class="Italic">jijñāsayā.</span> He has given the meaning of <span class="Italic">jijñāsayā.</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jñāna-buddha-vicāreṇa jijñāsayā</span> (?).<span class="Italic"> Jijñāsayā</span> means <span class="Italic">vedānta-vākya-vicāreṇa.</span> Vedānta. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsā. Jijñāsā,</span> inquisitiveness, should be satisfied by the answers given in the Vedānta. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsayā.</span> So Vedānta begins with this <span class="Italic">jijñāsā,</span> inquisitiveness. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsā. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This human life is meant for inquiring about the Supreme Brahman. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsā. Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam.</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says <span class="Italic">jijñāsu.</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also says, <span class="Italic">jñāni jijñāsuḥ ca bharatarṣabha. Catur-vidhā.</span> Find out this. <span class="Italic">Catur-vidhā bhajante mām, sukṛtino 'rjuna.</span> Those who are pious, they can begin <span class="Italic">bhajana. Sukṛtinaḥ.</span> So four kinds of men: <span class="Italic">ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī. Artaḥ</span> means distressed, materially distressed; <span class="Italic">arthārthī,</span> poor man who needs some money; <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> and <span class="Italic">jijñāsu-</span>these four classes of men, if they are pious, they inquire about the Absolute Truth. If they are pious. If one is pious, if he is distressed, he prays to Bhagavān, "Sir, I am in distressed condition. Kindly save me." This is piety. <span class="Italic">Arthārthī. Jñāni.</span> They are... So <span class="Italic">jñānī.</span> Human life is developed consciousness, <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> so why they should waste their time in inquiring so many unwanted things? They should devote their life simply for inquiring about the Absolute Truth, <span class="Italic">jijñāsu. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This life is meant for <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> This life is not meant for to live like cats and dogs. They have no <span class="Italic">jijñāsā.</span> Their only <span class="Italic">jijñāsā</span> is inquiry. Where is food? Where is sex? Where is nice apartment? Where is defense? This is their inquiry. In the animal life, there is no possibility of inquiring about the Absolute Truth. Everyone is working. They are also <span class="Italic">jijñāsu.</span> "Where is money? Where is money?" That is also inquiry. So <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i></span> means... (Aside) You can come this side. <span class="Italic">Brahma-jijñāsā</span> means this human form of life is meant for inquiring about the Absolute Truth, <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> This is human life. Unless one is <span class="Italic">jijñāsu,</span> just like Sanātana Gosvāmī went to Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he inquired... His first inquiry was, "What I am?" His first inquiry was. <span class="Italic">Ke āmi, kene āmāya jāre tāpa-traya?</span> He said, <span class="Italic">"grāmya-vyavahāre paṇḍita, tāi satya māni.</span>" He was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are addressed as <span class="Italic">"paṇḍitjī.</span>" He was <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> He was very learned scholar in Sanskrit and Parsee, Urdu. But he admitted his fault, that "Everyone calls me as <span class="Italic">paṇḍitjī,</span> but I am such a <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> that I do not know what I am. This is my <span class="Italic">'paṇḍitjī.</span>' Therefore I have come to inquire from You what I am." That is <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> Nobody knows in this material world what he is. Everyone is thinking, "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" "I am woman," "I am man." This is their... is their... They do not know. <span class="Italic">Brahma-jijñāsā. Brahma-jijñāsā</span> means first to know one's self, self-realization, "what I am." And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the first reply is given there. This <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> Because Arjuna was puzzled. He was thinking that "My kinsmen, my grandfather, my brothers, they are this skin, this body." So he was thinking, "If I kill my grandfather, my brother on the other side, what is the use of this fight? I do not like." But he was thinking in bodily concept of life. This is the position of everyone. Everyone is in the bodily concept of life. Therefore the first instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> The <span class="Italic">asmin dehe,</span> in this body, there is the soul. He is the proprietor. So this life should be, education means one should be advanced in education to inquire about himself, that is <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā. <i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> And as soon as there is question of <span class="Italic">jijñāsā,</span> then there must be somebody else from whom to inquire. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says that when you are <span class="Italic">jijñāsu,</span> when you are inquisitive... Inquisitive of what? <span class="Italic">Jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam. Śreyas.</span> Here we are also <span class="Italic">jijñāsu,</span> we are going to the market; "What is the rate of this share? What is the rate of this commodity? What is the rate of rice? What is...?" We are also <span class="Italic">jijñāsu.</span> But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam:</span> "One must be inquiring about the highest perfection of life." That is human life. <span class="Italic">Śreya uttamam. Śreyas</span> means... <span class="Italic">śreyas</span> and <span class="Italic">preyas.</span> Goodness, welfare, good. A small child does not know what is his <span class="Italic">śreyas.</span> If you give a two <span class="Italic">payasā</span> worth lozenges, he thinks, "This is my object, end of... I have got now nice sweet lozenges." But as you advance, then the <span class="Italic">śreyas</span> is different. It is <span class="Italic">preyas.</span> Immediately which you like, that is called <span class="Italic">preyas.</span> But what is your ultimate good, that is called <span class="Italic">śreyas. Ś</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">reyas and <span class="Italic">preyas.</span> So people are interested in the bodily concept of life. Anything which is immediately pleasing to my senses, we take it, "This is my end of life." Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">śreya uttamam,</span> not that <span class="Italic">śreyas</span> which is immediately very pleasing to you. What is immediately pleasing to you, it will be a source of great displeasure at the end. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So <span class="Italic">uttamam. Uttamam. Ut</span> means transcendental, and <span class="Italic">tama</span> means this material world. "Beyond this material world," <span class="Italic">Uttama. Śreya uttamam.</span> Because we are not this material body, therefore our <span class="Italic">śreyas,</span> our highest perfection of life, is different. Here the perfection of life-you get a comfortable life of the body. That is not possible, however comfortably you may situate. You may be very rich man, you may have very rich connection or good apartment, but still, you cannot be happy because you are not this body. But they do not know. Therefore one should be inquisitiveness that "I want to be happy. I am arranging for my happiness with so many material paraphernalia, but still I am not happy." This inquiry should be there. That is called <span class="Italic">jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam.</span> And that is <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> So <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā</span> is not for everyone. <span class="Italic">Brahma-jijñāsā.</span> And for <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā</span> one should make a guru, not for any material welfare. If I get some money, if some guru gives me some money, some gold, I think he is Bhagavān. Because I am attached to this gold and material things. That is not <span class="Italic">śreyas.</span> But people like that. If somebody by miracles give you some money, some gold, they think, "Oh, here is God. Here is God, here is God." But that is not <span class="Italic">śreyas.</span> And if gold is the standard of happiness, then... There are many persons, Birlas and others, they possess huge stock of gold. Does it mean that they will not die? They will not suffer from disease? But foolish persons, they think, "If I get some gold, then I'll be happy." And that is foolishness. Nothing material will make you happy. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, real happiness means to approach Him. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> No?

Kṛṣṇa also says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is real perfection of life. By understanding Kṛṣṇa, by surrendering to Kṛṣṇa, by going back to home back to Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span>.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paraṁ gati...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... <span class="Italic">nāpnuvanti. Saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhim.

Saṁsiddhi</span> is different. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paramāṁ gatāḥ.</span> The highest perfection, <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi</span> is to go back to home, back to Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi. Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That will save him from coming down again to this place which is full of miserable conditions of life. That is <span class="Italic">saṁsiddhi.</span> That one can attain very easily. That is also described, that <span class="Italic">janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ: [Bg. </span>4.9] "Anyone who understands Me in truth..." Generally, people understand Kṛṣṇa that "He appeared as a great personality, son of Vasudeva. At Mathurā, He was born. And He acted very gorgeously in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, and so on, so on." This is also knowing. But this is not knowing factually that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When one understands Kṛṣṇa, the original source of everything, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> which Kṛṣṇa explains, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat: [Bg. </span>7.7] "There is no superior authority beyond Me." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ: [Bg. </span>10.8] "I am the origin of all." When one understands Kṛṣṇa like that... The Māyāvādī philosophers, they think that "I am also Kṛṣṇa, I am also Kṛṣṇa." But people who follow, they do not ask him that "If you are Kṛṣṇa, you show something as Kṛṣṇa showed. Kṛṣṇa lifted the Govardhana Hill when He was seven years old. And you are seventy years old. What you have done like that?" (laughs) So everyone wants to become Kṛṣṇa, but he cannot manifest Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. Kṛṣṇa showed the <span class="Italic">virāṭ-rūpa</span> to Arjuna. What you have got? So this is Māyāvāda. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Nobody can be superior than Me or equal to Me, equal to Me." Therefore Kṛṣṇa's another name is <span class="Italic">Asamordhva.</span> Nobody is equal; nobody is above Him. <span class="Italic">Asamordhva.</span> So in this way if we understand Kṛṣṇa, then we become liberated. <span class="Italic">Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> And this <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ</span> is very significant. How you can know Kṛṣṇa as He is, in truth? That is also explained. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to understand Kṛṣṇa in <span class="Italic">tattva,</span> in fact, in truth, then you have to adopt this process of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Not <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> not yoga, not <span class="Italic">karma.</span> <span class="Italic">Karma, jñāna, yoga, bhakti.</span> So Kṛṣṇa is understandable simply by <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> not by other methods. Not by <span class="Italic">karma,</span> not by <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> not by yoga. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">jñānīs, karmīs,</span> yogis, they are trying to come to the Absolute Truth, but they will take many, many births to come to this point to surrender. Therefore intelligence means if one understands that "Ultimately I have to come to Kṛṣṇa for my highest perfection; then why not immediately? Kṛṣṇa is canvassing, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why not take this process?" This is intelligence. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān: [Bg. </span>7.19] "After many, many births when one actually becomes wise, <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> he surrenders, he surrenders." If one remains still unwise, not fully in knowledge, he hesitates, "Oh, why shall I surrender to Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is as like me; He is also a man. Maybe a powerful man, a very learned man." No. Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So anyone who understands Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ,</span> in truth... "Simply by understanding Kṛṣṇa, even if he does not understand fully, if he tries to understand Kṛṣṇa, that is also very good." That is also. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer</span> [SB 1.5.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even one tries to understand Kṛṣṇa, he does not finish, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt:</span> "Even little beginning of this devotional service can save one person from the greatest danger." Therefore there is great need of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement all over the world, to make them intelligent. Is there any question on this point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> Lord Brahmā also prays for to be born into Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes yes. Because he will try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Even Lord Brahmā could not understand Kṛṣṇa. (laughs) No. (Hindi) Therefore, to understand Kṛṣṇa he desired to take birth in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">Out of many millions of persons, they try to understand what is the perfection of life, and out of many such millions of persons who are in the line of understanding perfection of life, some of them or some one may understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ.</span> Just like Brahmā was also bewildered whether Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Brahmā, the first creature of this universe, he's also... <span class="Italic">muhyanti yat sūrayaḥ.</span> Therefore we should take advantage of this opportunity. Kṛṣṇa is explaining Himself in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> about Himself. That is the highest perfection of life, simply to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. As spoken by Kṛṣṇa. Then one's life is perfect. But unfortunately, so many scholars and swamis, they are misinterpreting Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The people are placed in darkness. They are already in darkness. By misinterpretation, they are putting them in darkness. They cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. For practical example you can see in European countries the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was being studied at least for two hundred, three hundred years, but there was not a single devotee of Kṛṣṇa, not even. Within the history. And now they are studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> you will find thousands of <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhaktas.</span> They are not given the chance to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by misinterpretation. "This means that, this means that, Kṛṣṇa means this, Kurukṣetra means body." Misinterpretation, misled. Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and people are accepting and becoming seriously devotee of Kṛṣṇa. They are surprised, the newspaper reporters. They inquire from me, "Swamiji, why younger generation is attracted with this movement?" And younger generation, they are inquisitive. Old fools, whatever they have learned they have to forget again. Then they will, it will take some time. They have learned something wrong. So one has to be washed of these wrong impressions; then he can come to the point of understanding Kṛṣṇa. But these young hearts, they are receptive. They are seeing, "Here is nice." They are accepting. They are chanting now on the streets. You have heard that record, Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that perfection is to please Kṛṣṇa. If by... You are doing everything. That's all right, but if by your working Kṛṣṇa is satisfied, then that working is perfect. If Kṛṣṇa is not satisfied, then it is useless, waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But how do I come to know that Kṛṣṇa is satisfied?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to learn by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. By becoming... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, whatever Kṛṣṇa says, you have to do that. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru: [Bg. </span>18.65] "Always think of Me, become My devotee, offer your obeisances unto Me." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava.</span> "Become My devotee." So if you abide by this, then Kṛṣṇa is satisfied. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi yat tapasyasi kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam: [Bg. 9.27]</span> "Whatever you are doing, it doesn't matter, but you do it for Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Without any selfish interest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You remain servant of Kṛṣṇa. Just like a servant discharges his duty very faithfully for the satisfaction of the master, similarly, you have got industry, if you work in this industrial work for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa... Just like this boy behind you, he is working somewhere, getting good salary. But I had told him that "some percentage you must give to Kṛṣṇa." He is regularly giving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If I feel I have love for Kṛṣṇa, is that enough to be a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must show how your love... Simply if you say... Suppose, anywhere in this material world, if you say somebody that "I love you," but there is no symptoms of love, then what kind of love? Love symptoms means <span class="Italic">dadāti,</span> giving. First symptom. Just like when a boy goes to love a girl, he brings something. That is ordinary etiquette. So first beginning of love is <span class="Italic">dadāti, pratigṛhṇāti.</span> If I love you, I must give you. And if you offer me, I will take it, I will take something. <span class="Italic">Pratigṛhṇāti.</span> Exchange, giving and taking. <span class="Italic">Dadāti pratigṛhṇāti, bhuṅkte bhojayate.</span> If you love somebody, give him to eat, and whatever he gives you, you also eat. <span class="Italic">Dadāti pratigṛhṇāti bhuṅkte bhojayate, guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati.</span> And if you love somebody then you disclose your mind to him and try to understand him also. By these six processes the symptoms of love is there. But if you say that "I love you," but there is no action...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That giving should be without any intention of taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no profit making, no business that "I give you something. I must have something from you." No, no. Love means without any desire, <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> without any motive. That is pure love. If I give you something without any motive, that is pure love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> (Hindi) ...there are three factors: one, duty towards God, duty towards the family, duty towards the business, duty towards the country, duty towards the society. Then how is he to balance himself in these duties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Duty, there are so many duties. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says,</div>
<div class="Verse">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir<br class="calibre2"/>ekeha kuru-nandana<br class="calibre2"/>bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca<br class="calibre2"/>buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>2.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those who are actually perfect, their <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> is one. And those who are not perfect, their <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> is distributed in so many ways." Just like you said, duties, so many, so many, this, that, this, that. But just like there are many branches and twigs and leaves and flowers in a tree, but if you pour water in the root, then it approaches everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes. Therefore the duty's also in the strongroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try to understand that you must know how to discharge your duty. Because you do not know what is duty, therefore you are placing so many other duties, "Nationality, this is, this is..." <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti kaile sarva-karma kṛta haya.</span> If you become devotee... Just like your son. Is he not maintaining his family, is he not respecting his father, mother, he is not doing his duty in the service, he is doing his spiritual master? But the main principle is that he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So if you become devotee of Kṛṣṇa, you can discharge your duties properly; otherwise you cannot. It is not possible. If you want to pour water, leaf after leaf, it will be useless waste of time. But if you pour water in the center, on the root, it will go everywhere. Because he is devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he knows how to discharge his duty towards his parents, how to discharge his duty to his wife, how to discharge his duties towards his spiritual master. He knows everything. But one who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he does not know. He is simply confused. Sometimes jumping here, something jumping there, something jumping there. He does not know how to pour water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But what should be the first step to become a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">dadāti.</span> That I have already explained. <span class="Italic">Dadāti.</span> He must give. Give. Everyone goes to God to beg, "God, give us our daily bread." But one must go to God to give Him. If I do not give bread to Kṛṣṇa, he will be starving. This is devotee's mentality. Yaśodāmāyī, Yaśodāmāyī is thinking, Kṛṣṇa, "If I do not feed Kṛṣṇa well, my child will die." This is devotion. Otherwise everyone is asking from Kṛṣṇa. But Yaśodā-mā is thinking that "If I do not maintain Kṛṣṇa properly, He will die." Therefore he (she) is always trying to supply everything, <span class="Italic">mākhana, miśri.</span> So real love begins when you try to give God. Everyone is trying to take from God, "Oh father, give us our daily bread." This is not pure devotee. This is good because he has approached God, but this is not devotion. It is not devotion, it is..., means business "God, give me something, then I will love you." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But giving means, you know, giving part of what you earn, or some other way. When you say give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give means, you want to take something from God. "God, give me wealth, give me fame" <span class="Italic">Yaśo dehi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, if we want to give to God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, when you learn to give God. Generally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Therefore, if a man feels empty, what he can offer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, empty... God says that you can give Him <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> You can give Him little flower, little fruit, little leaf, little water. He is satisfied. Not that you have to give millions of dollars. But if you have got millions of dollars, and if you think, "God will be satisfied with little fruit," that is cheating. God knows, "He is a cheater. He has got millions of dollars and offering me little leaf, little water." He is intelligent enough. He knows that he's a cheater. People do that. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> in the mind God, and for others, <span class="Italic">garama garama puri.</span> And for Kṛṣṇa, within the mind, meditate. (laughter) God knows that "He is a cheater number one. He is preparing <span class="Italic">puri</span> for himself, and for Me he is meditating." What is this nonsense? How meditation will help?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> God expects something from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God does not expect. It is for your good. If you are simply taking from God, now if you learn how to give God, that is your perfection. That is your perfection. Why God will ask from you? He is all perfect. He does not want. He is not hungry. He is feeding millions of living entities. <span class="Italic">Eko bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Why God will ask from you? But if you give your life to God, then you become perfect. God is not want of, in your service or anything... He is complete. If he is not complete, he is not God. These are all mental concoctions. What you can do? What you have got to give charity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest 4 (Indian man):</span> What is the position of man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are poor man, what you can give, charity? Why you are thinking that you can give in charity? Therefore God says, <span class="Italic">dadāsi yat:</span> "If you are thinking to make some charity, give it to Me. Come on." Just like Bali Mahārāja was approached by Vāmanadeva. The Supreme Lord went to Bali Mahārāja, "Bali Mahārāja, give Me some land." You see. So these are all mental concoctions. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that "If you have got such mentality to give some charity, give it to Me. Come on." The first thing is you try to learn how to give God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But Gurujī, giving those who are in need, is not giving to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your philosophy. That is your philosophy. Everyone is needy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Now people... There are drought conditions, people are starving. Cattles are dying. There are no rains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they are not God conscious, they are thinking like that. Now, suppose in the hospital, there are many patients. They are starving, many patients in the hospital. Do you know that or not? So why don't you give them food? They are starving. Why? Why don't you go to the hospital and you'll find hundreds of patients, they are starving... So similarly, why you are bothering? You are not bothering the hospital because you know that is right, they are starving. That is the physician's prescription. They must starve. So if you know God, then you will understand that you cannot help anyone. They are put into the starving condition under certain condition. So you cannot help them. You are simply thinking that "I will help." There are hundreds and thousands, millions of people starving. What you can do? Even if you try to give some something. Just like this Vivekananda philosophy, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā,</span> to serve the poor Nārāyaṇa. Nārāyaṇa has become poor. These are manufactured things. This is not with reference to the authorized <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> or knowledge. What they can do? They raise subscription, huge subscription, on this plea, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> And Swami Nikhilananda in New York, he personally said, "Now these Americans ask me that you take from us so much money for <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā,</span> but when we go to India, we see all these <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇas</span> are lying on the footpath." What you are doing for them? What you can do? You are simply thinking falsely. What you have got to give? Just oil in your own machine. Try to understand God, instead of thinking foolishly, "Oh, what I shall do, this? What I shall do, that?" First, of all try to understand the situation.</div>
