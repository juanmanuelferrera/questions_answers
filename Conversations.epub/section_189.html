<div class="Heading">Room Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>December 10, 1971, New Delhi</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">(yasyātmā buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke)<br class="calibre2"/>sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu bhauma-ijyadhīḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yat-tīrtha-buddhiḥ salile na karhicij<br class="calibre2"/>janeṣv abhijñeṣu sa eva go-kharaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>10.84.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So the world is under the bodily concept of life, so they are thinking that "We are Americans,'' "Indians.'' This is the disease. So they are described as animals, <i class="calibre3">go-kharaḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Go</i> means cow; <i class="calibre3">kharaḥ</i> means ass. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to save them from this animal consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means real consciousness, and without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, just animals. Therefore that Prahlāda Maharaja said,</div>
<div class="Verse">sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā<br class="calibre2"/>deha-yogena dehinām<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra labhyate daivād<br class="calibre2"/>yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Dehātma-buddhi</i>. So long we are under the concept of this body, that "I am this body,'' his business is sense gratification, because this body means senses. We have got varieties of senses. So the bodily concept of life means the senses are dominant. Therefore, beginning from the animals up to the human being, under the bodily concept of life they're busy simply for sense gratification. Nature is giving chance, "All right.'' Because everyone who has come to this material world, that is for sense gratification. Those who deny to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, they are sent here, "All right, you satisfy your sense by your labor here.'' Kṛṣṇa can satisfy His senses without any labor, but we have to satisfy our senses by dint of our labor. Not easy. You cannot become a millionaire so easy, or he cannot be a citizen in the heavenly planet so easy. That is our experience. So if some man from a poor family becomes, wants to become a citizen of America, a rich man, it is not so easy. You have to undergo through so many things to get the citizenship. There are so many, that your country, yes, they have got big immigration department simply to consider this application of different countries for citizenship, or to immigrate. I have seen, in Montreal, people applying for citizenship or immigration, big line, very big line, and a similar immigration department in Canada, there is no problem. So people very much anxious to become citizens in America, because it's a rich country. So as there is restriction here in this place, in this planet, that you cannot enter any other country... If you think their country is very nice, actually, in comparison to other countries, there are so many facilities in America. At least, one can earn money like anything. So people are inclined to become citizen. But that is not easy, even within this planet. So how you will easily enter moon planet and other heavenly planets without being competent? It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Lecture">So we are called conditioned soul because we are conditioned according to this body. <i class="calibre3">Deha-yogena dehinām</i>. The..., according to <i class="calibre3">karma</i>, the certain privileges or disadvantages, what you are destined to receive, that is already a fact according to your birth. Just like somebody's suffering from asthma, so he has got a body from a father and mother, and from the very beginning there is asthma. That body is the symptom or the result of his past <i class="calibre3">karma</i>. Therefore the material advantages or disadvantages are already settled up according to <i class="calibre3">karma</i>. So those who are sane man, they are confident that "Kṛṣṇa has given me this body according to my past <i class="calibre3">karma</i>, so let me not improve. Let me not waste my time for improving the advantages and disadvantages of this material world.'' But you cannot do it. The body is already there, according to your <i class="calibre3">karma</i>. <i class="calibre3">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 3.31.1]. It is already given to you. So people should be satisfied. Just like when I got this body of an ass, so you can test. And the advantage and (indistinct) that ass is meant for becoming beast of burden. He has to do that. Similarly, there is a body, the hog, he has to eat stool. So we should know it, that either we are born in such a country, such society, the body is there, and I can get my happiness and distress according to this body. This is settled up. But they do not know. They're simply trying to, unnecessary wasting time for bodily comforts. "Oh, you are so comfortable. Let me try.'' Huh? "I shall try also.'' So Prahlāda Maharaja says, "No, don't waste your time like that. Your time is very valuable.''</div>
<div class="Lecture">So that was Vedic civilization. <i class="calibre3">Brāhmaṇa</i>, <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya</i>, <i class="calibre3">vaiśya</i>, <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i>, everyone is expert, but every is engaged in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is no bodily barrier. No. "Because I have got a particular type of body, therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness is forbidden for me.'' No, that is not. In any body, any circumstances, you can cultivate Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But not material. But people, they do not know. They think that "Kṛṣṇa consciousness there is no need, but let me improve my bodily comfort.'' This is called illusion. He cannot improve, even by an inch, the burden, but still... But you can improve, or you can purify, your consciousness. That is open to you, oh, irrespective of bodily (indistinct). And that is actually happening. You have got a different body from the before. (indistinct) But everyone, your taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, Kṛṣṇa says, "It doesn't matter what kind of body you have got-low born, or high born, or this born or that born. I have no such restriction. If you want Me, <i class="calibre3">te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim</i>. <i class="calibre3">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ </i>[Bg. 15.7], you are all My parts and parcels. Every one of you are equally important to Me.'' And similarly, a devotee of Kṛṣṇa also sees. He does not see the outward cover. He sees that "Every living entity is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. So he is now forgetful of his real position. So let us help him that he may come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and become successful.'' This is our position. There is no question of bodily barrier. <i class="calibre3">Ahaituky apratihatā</i>. <i class="calibre3">Bhakti</i> line is so nice that there is no cause and effect. Cause and effect is for this body. <i class="calibre3">Karmaṇā</i>, by my previous activity, I get a certain type, particular type of body, cause and effect. That is not applicable in devotional service. <i class="calibre3">Ahaituky apratihatā</i>. "Because I am high-born, I will have Kṛṣṇa consciousness.'' No. Or "Because I am low-born, I cannot have Kṛṣṇa consciousness.'' That is not. <i class="calibre3">Ahaituky</i>. There is no such cause and effect. <i class="calibre3">Apratihatā</i>. <i class="calibre3">Apratihatā</i>, without any barrier. Everyone. The body is not barrier, we should always remember. Bodily concept of life is the consciousness of the animals, and spiritual concept of life is the consciousness of the perfect being. I am servant, eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. This we should know. We should not cry for bodily problem. We should simply try to improve our Kṛṣṇa consciousness, how we can better serve Kṛṣṇa. That is our business. Bodily comforts, this comfort, that is already settled up with this body. But we should also know that anyone who is Kṛṣṇa conscious, if he has got any slight desire for bodily comfort, he'll get that. He'll get that. But without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if he tries, that is not possible. If I have got slight desire for my material improvement, Kṛṣṇa will satisfy you, if you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That means you are double way benefited. You get Kṛṣṇa consciousness as well as your desire for material benefit. That is also there. But without Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if you want to improve your material condition, that is not possible. <i class="calibre3">Deha-yogena de..</i>. You may become rich, that's all right, but comfort does not depend on your richness. If you're not Kṛṣṇa conscious, it does not mean because you have got some money by struggling very hard you'll get. There are so many rich men you'll find, they are not comfortable. I have heard from our students, their parents, just like Śyāmasundara was telling, his father is taking... What is that pill?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sleeping tablets.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sleeping tablets. He cannot sleep. Similarly, Brahmānanda was telling about his father. So if you can earn money, you can make a good bank balance, that does not mean that you will get bodily comfort. That is not. That is already fixed up, according to your <i class="calibre3">karma</i>. So don't waste your time for improving bodily comforts. Simply try to improve how you'll become more and more Kṛṣṇa conscious, how you will serve Kṛṣṇa more and more, very nicely. That should be all. <i class="calibre3">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]. For that purpose our life should be engaged, not for so-called bodily comfort. That is already fixed-up.</div>
<div class="Lecture">So any questions?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You said that if you have some material desire and you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, you get double benefit, that the material desire is fulfilled and also you get Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But if you have that material desire, does that slow up your advancement?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By Kṛṣṇa consciousness it will vanish. But Kṛṣṇa is so kind, because you desire, He'll give you. He'll give you. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that "Oh, you wanted this? All right, you take!'' That is the benefit of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You get both these things. You reject, "No, I asked for...'' That is real pure devotion. "For this paltry happiness I requested Kṛṣṇa. What a fool I was.'' But Kṛṣṇa will give you because you desire. Therefore Dhruva Maharaja regretted that "I was such a fool that I came to in the forest Kṛṣṇa for asking my father's property. What a nonsense I was.'' But Kṛṣṇa gave. Better than. He demanded that "I shall have a property,'' because that was child. His stepmother insulted, so he was determined. Nārada Muni had requested him, "My dear boy, you are child. Why you be afflicted to this insult? Go now to play.'' So he said, "Your instruction is very nice, but I am so degraded, I cannot accept it as such. If you kindly give me some way that I can get,'' I mean, "material opulence better than my grandfather and father. You just give me such a post.'' His father was Uttānapāda. Grandfather was Brahma. So he wanted a post better than Brahma. So he was given: "Oh, yes, you'll get.'' But when he was offered a better position than Brahma, he regretted that "What I..., what a fool I was.'' He requested, "Sir, I am very much satisfied simply by Your...'' "Never mind. You enjoy, then you come back.'' Kṛṣṇa is so kind.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...can you explain about <i class="calibre3">vaibhava </i> and <i class="calibre3">prabhāva?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <i class="calibre3">Vaibhava</i> and <i class="calibre3">prabhāva.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're nonsense. Why do you ask all these questions?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It is in the <i class="calibre3">Caitanya...</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meher Baba?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> <i class="calibre3">Teaching of Lord Caitanya</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's not saying "Baba.'' Something I can't understand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meher Baba, he's a...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <i class="calibre3">Vaibhava.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Meher..., and <i class="calibre3">Vaibhava</i>. I thought that Meher Baba. (laughter) [break] There was a Hari Baba, there was a Meher Baba. Meher Baba is famous in your country. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a nonsense. <i class="calibre3">Vaibhava</i>, <i class="calibre3">prabhāvā</i>, expansion of Kṛṣṇa. When the body is similar, but the color of the body different, that is called <i class="calibre3">vaibhava</i>. Just like Balarāma. Balarāma. Kṛṣṇa's body and Balarāma, there is no bodily difference, but Kṛṣṇa is blackish, Balarāma is whitish. These things are described in the <i class="calibre3">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</i>. You don't read it? Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, it's from the <i class="calibre3">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</i>. I wanted some explanation about all this...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That explanation is there. Why you are asking me? That is... I do not remember exactly what is the features of <i class="calibre3">Vaibhava</i>. That is there. But the <i class="calibre3">vaibhava</i>, <i class="calibre3">prabhāvā</i>, <i class="calibre3">vaibhava</i>, <i class="calibre3">vilāsa</i>, there are detailed description of Kṛṣṇa's expansions. They are described there. You can refer to. <i class="calibre3">Prabhāvā</i>, <i class="calibre3">vaibhava</i>, <i class="calibre3">vilāsa</i>, they are expansions of Kṛṣṇa's different <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>, incarnation, and part, part of incarnation. So it is a huge list, and it's not always possible to remember them in detail. Better refer to the book. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The teacher will remember all the work of the dictionary. (laughs) You can refer to the dictionary. (laughter) (end)</div>
