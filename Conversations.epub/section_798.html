<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> There is a... There is a problem to some extent, but I don't think it should be exaggerated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> ...that you should be disturbed. It's not that everything is collapsing like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they should be engaged in some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How can you say the situation...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cottage industry. Cottage industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we can manufacture so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda::</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The engagement must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It can be organized. The children should be raised Kṛṣṇa devotees. The woman can be engaged. Everyone can be engaged. I can give you suggestion if you can execute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were thinking that it would be nice to have the cities, city-centers, for the preachers, and those, for example, women, children, it's much easier to maintain them on our farms. That way they can do a little work and produce their own food and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the farms they can live and do some handwork.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They won't do it, though, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They must do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you don't allow. Don't allow that. Don't allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Maintenance is much more simple, easier, less expensive for them on a farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they do not follow the rules and regulations, then what is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We were thinking that unless someone is a preacher, he has no real business in the city. Let him go have a peaceful life out on the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It has been seen that when many householders come together in many of our big communities, because there are so many women and children, there is a great atmosphere of laziness a lot of times. I have seen in Los Angeles and also in many other temples. But when there's a lot of <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> preaching, it's much more enlivening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now you make some regulation. Otherwise... Attending class? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They attend class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yeah, they attend <span class="Italic">aratikas</span> and class because there's no other activity there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> No, they should attend. They are attending. I have... We had nice... Bhakti... Your Guru Mahārāja appearance day, we had nice program. Some people came...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone should be engaged. That's all. No idle life. That should be... <span class="Italic">Karma jyāyo hy akarma-kṛt.</span> (sic) What is that? <span class="Italic">Śarīra-yātrāpi te na prasiddhyed akarmanaḥ.</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Niyata.... Niyataṁ kuru karma tvaṁ karma jyāyoḥ' akarmanaḥ, śarīra yātrāpi te.</span> Kṛṣṇa never encouraged laziness, never encouraged. [break] "...people are maintaining some lazy men." Then everything will be spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That boy, Mahendra, told me when you, he came back. I met him in Germany. He said that you remarked that our society is not love-making society. But there are so many of these things are going on, and there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> ...a burden for maintaining our temples because there's so many of these women and children with no husbands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Actually, in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Because they do not take marriage life seriously in this age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> In the temples, they engage the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> to support the householders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> are supporting the householders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Well, they are doing the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> and collecting the funds, and the householders are spending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...nature. <span class="Italic">Uparvata pani.</span> (?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> About five <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> went down there, and they were lifting the <span class="Italic">karāi</span> on the head, and they were encouraging the men, and the people became... And Guru-kṛpā was coming and Gargamuni... The people were so happy that the devotees were there. They were working much harder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When a man takes his work in his own hand, it is sure to be done. So all of you encourage them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka :</span> Maheśvara commented that although all day we're yelling at the men, when the work is over, they are laughing and saying, "Hare Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is association, a mass movement. [break] ...our boy, especially boy, in solitary place, then spoiled. Then the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is there immediately. That is very dangerous. (end)</div>
