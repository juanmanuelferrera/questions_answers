<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The stricture of nature's law, that is science. Is it not scientific effort? They will never be able to do so, but still, they are... To stop death, birth, death, old age, is very major problem, but even in small things you cannot do anything. Everywhere you are dependent. And still, they are very much proud that they are advancing in scientific knowledge so that they can overcome the stringent laws of nature and so on, so on. <span class="Italic">Durāśaya.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">durāśaya</span>, hope which will never be fulfilled. Is it not? <span class="Italic">Durāśaya. Śāstra, Bhāgavata,</span> says, <span class="Italic">durāśaya</span>. This is their foolishness. They are expecting something which will never be fulfilled. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">durāśaya.</span> Now what they are doing about the moon planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They've forgotten about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Now they're trying for Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. <span class="Italic">Hele dāntavān keuṭe.</span>(?) A man was trying to capture snake. So there are snakes, <span class="Italic">hele.</span> There are many snakes; they have no poison, especially the water snake, the <span class="Italic">hele.</span> So <span class="Italic">hele dāntavān keuṭe.</span>(?) <span class="Italic">Keuṭe</span> means cobra. So one cannot catch up the poisonless snake, and he is attempting to capture cobra. They could not go to the moon planet, which is only 1,600,000 miles above the sun, and they are going to Venus, which is far, far away, still. How many miles the Venus is situated? They have committed some mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. Well, they say here it's 600,000 <span class="Italic">yojanas,</span> which makes 48,000,000 miles. No, 480,000,000 miles above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they cannot reach sun... They are trying to go above the sun. (Someone enters) <span class="Italic">Bosen</span>. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Bengali) [break] It is giving quotation from <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> How to act on Vedic principle, that is called <span class="Italic">smṛti.</span> Sometimes the original law is explained by one lawyer in detail. So that detailed explanation is like <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> and the original law is <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> In that we have to bathe. <span class="Italic">Smṛti</span> means which is explaining <span class="Italic">śruti</span> to understand easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we should never think that <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> is an interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not inter... It is explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like sometimes the <span class="Italic">smārtas,</span> they argue that if you quote <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> it is not as good as <span class="Italic">śruti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But <span class="Italic">smṛti...</span> Just like the Māyāvādīs. They do not accept because their interpretation of <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. So they say that <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> is an interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> many of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what is our answer to such persons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got our own <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> If you don't accept, I don't accept you. That is my... What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Madhvācārya made a commentary on the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> where he quoted a Sanskrit verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He quoted a Vedic verse for every <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> verse to prove that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">śruti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Madhvācārya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Or somebody like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya has quoted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Rāmānujācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya has given quotation from <span class="Italic">śruti</span> for every verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> (Someone enters and offers obeisances) You read from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It starts off in big print, "Ācāryadeva Tridandi Swami Śrīla Bhaktivilāsa Tīrtha Mahārāja. All learned men are aware that in the dark days of India when the Hindu religion was in great danger..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) This is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> "...our Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu was born at Śrī Māyāpura, destined to remove the dark clouds which had overshadowed true religious thinking by traveling alone on foot throughout the length and breadth of India. Preaching His gospel of love, He brought about a religious upheaval which put an end to all religious conflicts and suicidal vissiferous(?) tendencies. The benign influence of His love philosophy made the whole of India a spiritually united cultural domain. Soul-enrapturing <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> music was organized from one end of the country to another. A neo-humanism based on love regarded as the highest objective of human existence held sway. The difference between man and man was forgotten, and the fundamental unity of human nature and human destiny was stressed upon. But in the early nineteenth century, true religion was at a very low ebb due to lack of proper publicity of literature and also for want of great <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> to propagate the cults in their true aspect. It was a dark period for the Caitanya or Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism when it fell from its highest transcendentalism to the lowest possible degradation because of so many abuses and evil practices which crept into it through plenty of pseudo-followers. Vaiṣṇavism was almost abandoned by the educated section of people. Its literature was hardly read. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> was looked upon not as a form of prayer but as a means of gratification by people of loose morals. Most of the Vaiṣṇava followers of the period lost their high standard of morality, their loving aestheticism, their intellectual superiority and devotional fervor, which were the main characteristics of the previous masters. The influx of Western ideas came in, and English educated people fell into the hands of Christians. Fortunately, at that time, we got a great Vaiṣṇava savant and scholar, Ṭhākura Kedāranātha Bhaktivinoda, who wrote widely and successfully created an interest among the educated public in Vaiṣṇava religion and literature. His discovery of Śrīdhāma Māyāpura, the birthplace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, which was so long hidden from the public eye, gave a new impetus to its propagation. The age of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism set in. Thereafter, Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Ṭhākura took hold of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism with a vow to propagate it in its true perspective, even as it was practiced with unparalleled and unprecedented transcendentalism by Śrī Rūpa and Śrī Sanātana Gosvāmīs, followers of Śrī Caitanya. In proper time, he got a great personality who readily shouldered the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see now. "He got a great personality." He is that personality. He'll also prove that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> "...who shouldered the burden of the mighty mission of Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura. That great personality is President Ācāryadeva, his holiness Śrī Śrīmad Bhaktivilāsa..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you... <span class="Italic">Jaya morena apne morol.</span>(?) This great personality, why he is not accepted by other disciples? How he became a great personality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. If one proclaims himself to be the king and no one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one accepts him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called in Bengali, <span class="Italic">jaya mane apna morol.</span>(?) <span class="Italic">Morol</span> means the leader of the society, of the village. Here there are <span class="Italic">morol.</span> So in the village nobody cares for him, and he declares that "I am <span class="Italic">morol.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That person is insane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody cares for him, and he is thinking that "great personality." Where is his greatness? Who knows him? Just see. So he is making a plan to declare himself a great personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It goes on to explain why he is such a great personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why explain? If he is great personality, everyone should know. Why he is trying to explain? What is the use of explanation? If a great personality is unknown, and he has to be known by explanatory notes, then how he is great personality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Just like the President of the United States. He doesn't have to say, "I am the President." Everyone knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Go on reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> "...Tīrtha Mahārāja, who was then known as <span class="Italic">guru-preṣṭha,</span> most dear to his guru, and also known to the disciples of Śrīla Sarasvatī Ṭhākura as <span class="Italic">Kuñjada,</span> giver of shelter. In all the missionary works and the management of the <span class="Italic">maṭhas,</span> Śrīla Bhaktivilāsa Tīrtha Gosvāmī Mahārāja was the right hand of his Gurudeva. By his constant, unstinted service rendered to Śrīla Prabhupāda, whose most intimate disciple he was, he almost became a counterpart of that great saint."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. This is not... "Counterpart." Jumping... Trying to equal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So those who are not accepting him, so they are all fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is very bad, Prabhupāda. It says he wanted to be... He almost became counterpart. That means he is trying to become equal or superior to guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> In this first sentence, superior, that Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, his whole mission was dependent upon this great personality, Tīrtha Mahārāja. Not that Bhaktisiddhānta was a great personality, but that the great personality is Tīrtha Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He said, "In proper time he got a great personality who readily shouldered the burden of the mighty mission of Sarasvatī Ṭhākura." That's implying that he is the one responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says... his impression is like that. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> "In all preaching work, everybody felt the sober but encouraging hand of Śrīla Bhaktivilāsa Tīrtha Gosvāmī Mahārāja. Śrīla Prabhupāda never did anything without consulting him first or without his consent. So all the desires for future work of Prabhupāda Śrīla Sarasvatī..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not mention his name. He says... All right, go. His <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> name is... All right. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> "All the desires for future work of Śrīla Prabhupāda Sarasvatī Ṭhākura used to come to the present <span class="Italic">ācāryadeva</span> as an impulse first, which he translated into action at once. In spite of a hundred hindrances from so-called religionists with a vision of a future worldwide mission, Śrīla Prabhupāda established Śrī Caitanya Maṭha at Śrī Māyāpura, the birthplace of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, on the <span class="Italic">Phālguna Pūrṇimā</span> day, the seventh March, 1918, which was a red-letter day in the history of theistic religious revival in this age. He started a countrywide movement to carry the message of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu to every door. In a hectic manner within a couple of years he preached Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism throughout India and sent disciples to England, Germany, and other parts of Europe and Burma to preach the message of Śrī Caitanya and establish sixty-four branches under the name of Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭha throughout India and abroad, and a vast literature flowed through his versatile pen. The large number of publications in different languages and the vigorous missionary activities and door-to-door preaching by the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> of the Maṭha, who held meetings in the remotest villages, duly spread Śrī Caitanya's teachings, which today are followed in every part of India. His songs are sung in chorus and a great interest is created among the intelligentsia of India. After having become the president of the institution..." In this last paragraph, all of these activities of Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura, there is no mention of his name. His whole mission, there is actually no mention of his name, that he is the one who has done it. "After having become the president of the institution, Śrīla Bhaktivilāsa Tīrtha Gosvāmī Mahārāja has been traveling throughout India and Pakistan preaching the devotional cult of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and he has come in contact with many savants of present India who are all struck with reverent admiration for his deep knowledge of philosophy. Dr. Rādhākamal Mukherjee, vice chancellor of Lucknow University, remarks, 'There is no more distinguished and erudite interpreter of Śrī Caitanya's Vaiṣṇava thought than His Holiness Śrīla Bhaktivilāsa Tīrtha Gosvāmī Mahārāja.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is Rādhākamal Mukherjee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> " 'He has been a prolific writer and commentator and has traveled and discoursed widely in different parts of India. His profound illuminative discourses have everywhere created a genuine interest in Vaiṣṇava philosophy and in the dynamic religious movement he represents.' There may not be any doubt among the well-informed people that the Śrī Caitanya Maṭha, with its branches, Śrī Gauḍīya Maṭhas, throughout India and abroad, have been propagating the greatest religion, which, from a realistic point of view, has helped to build up a true civilization. Today, due to the activities of Śrī Caitanya Maṭha, a spiritual thirst has been created, especially among the deep-thinking and educated people of the world, for people from all over the world are coming to this institution to learn and follow the great religion of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu and to understand the practical Indian way of life. Today the headquarter extends over a mile, with beautiful temples, yet standing in an atmosphere of absorbing silence of meditation and worship, surrounded on all sides by emerald green paddy fields and the Ganges flowing hard by, far from the madding crowd's strife and strain. 'Māyāpura is now an enchanted place, the abode of peace. The atmosphere of the place is charming. The chanting of the holy name of Hari all day and night takes one to a celestial place.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't hear the chanting from their <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> all day and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No, it's only from here. "It is more heavenly than heaven itself. It is the sacred Vṛndāvana of Bengal, hallowed by the dancing steps of the Lord, and its air is purified by His noble call to prayer. Whoever pays a visit to her will leave her with regret, and those who have not yet visited the place will carry their regrets unto death."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is making some propaganda that he is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, just like in the woods the jackal is always crying that he is the king, but who cares for him? What is his qualification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do we require to...? There is no use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, our answer is all of these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Our answer is twenty-four-hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana, prasādam</span> distribution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you keep it very carefully in the file.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should answer him by our preaching, by our vigorous preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Many people must be asking him, "What about this ISKCON <span class="Italic">maṭha</span>?" That's why he is... It's driving him mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's speaking against us all the time. He never says anything good about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is very envious about us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But I think now he must have come to the conclusion that there is no way to stop us, so he is thinking how he can... I have a hunch he is thinking how he can become connected in some way to get some benefit. That's why he is sending this man, this <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> commander. Because he sees now there is no way he can stop us, so he is thinking, "How can I connect somehow with them? Because they have so much money and they're going to be doing so many big things, I must establish a connection with them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he wants to establish connection with us and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And describe that he has... Just like Mādhava Mahārāja also attempted. This is the attempt. So what we have to do in this connection? Let them do whatever nonsense they want. We shall do our own business. And we have no business to propagate that we are making... People already know us all over the world. So... But suppose if he makes an attempt to mix with us so that he can take advantage, his main policy is that we may go there. That is his... Because if we do not go, then all their propaganda makes him not very important if we go there..., if we do not go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why does he depend upon our going there to become important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he is visualizing that by our propaganda throughout the whole world, people will come here. That he has already seen. And if we do not go there, then he becomes insignificant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we don't means if anyone from all over the world who comes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> People are attracted by the Westerners coming to the <span class="Italic">maṭha.</span> So if we're up at that <span class="Italic">maṭha,</span> any of us, and then they say, "Just see." They say in Bengali, "Just see. They are coming. To see our guru mahārāja, they are coming."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the policy of Mādhava Mahārāja and Śrīdhara Mahārāja, that "Although Bhaktivedanta Swami is propagating throughout, he is subordinate to us, under our instruction." So all these three...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A real dream world they are living in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Here they have even included our temple in their domain. "The headquarters extends for over a mile with beautiful temples and paddy fields." When we put up our wall, then they will not be able to include us. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The point is that no matter how much they press for any kind of mixing, our first point is: "You come here and visit us." And he'll never do that. Never do that. And we should not... We already invited him twice, so we don't have to give any more invitation. We should simply say verbally, "Let Tīrtha Mahārāja come here as we have come so many times. Then we can speak about some kind of cooperation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I remember, Śrīla... You walked there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> From here you walked all the way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twice Prabhupāda has visited and personally requested, and he won't come here. And now... The thing is now he might say, "If you give it to me in writing, I will come," but we'll say, "We have already personally come. Our spiritual master has come twice personally, and now you have to simply come. The invitation is already given. Now Tīrtha Mahārāja should come here." He'll never do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He'll never come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. So then that way we don't have to cooperate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this paper you keep, because these rascals they may create some trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of trouble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trouble like this, just like he was detained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> When I had that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can file some complaint inducing something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it was very interesting. Last night that complaint, my lawyer was this man who was sitting right here last night, this old man, Nandulal? He was my lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> And he is the one who asked me, "Who is behind this case?" He asked me when we brought him from Krishnanagar. Because he is considered the best lawyer in Nadia, so we brought him in, and as we were leaving, after the first time I appeared, he said, "There is someone... This man is a farmer, laborer. Who has put him up to this? There is someone behind this." So he asked me, "Was it Śrīdhara? Someone of the Gauḍīya Maṭha is behind this." But he came last night with them, this lawyer, old man, he came with them. So they were definitely the ones behind it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They were definitely the ones behind that case. They somehow got their hands on that man and had him bring charges, even though the whole thing was dropped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who was behind them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Well, this man, he mentioned Śrīdhara Mahārāja's name. He said, "Some Gauḍīya Maṭha person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a very good lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. He's retired, but he's the most respected lawyer in Nadia. So he mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was in our side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. So he had mentioned, "Someone from the Gauḍīya Maṭha." He said, "You have many enemies. This man would not have thought of this kind of thing, to do this kind of thing. Someone had to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> When I had to go to court to appear for having kidnapped that woman and her son, that I was holding the woman and her son by force-the husband placed charges-so this lawyer said, "That... He was a simple man, a little crazy. He wouldn't have done it or had the money to do it. Someone with some more intelligence, higher intelligence, is behind him, goading him on, telling him what to do." He asked who did I think it was? He mentioned Gauḍīya Maṭha, and he asked for any, did I know any particular personalities. I said, "No." He said, "What about Śrīdhara Swami?" Someone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if Śrīdhara Swami was behind... Maybe. There is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The point is that they can make so much trouble like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Small troubles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, little harassment. Then I even... Of course, I don't know. I even question... Just like that Lalitā Bose, that whole incident which Jayapatākā told you about. Who knows? She is so influenced by... She is big, so-called Vaiṣṇava, and known in so many circles in Bengal. Who is influencing her? You know? Anyway, we simply stay on our land and develop our program. He is going mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He is becoming mad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Tīrtha Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Well, the more he hears. Because he gets so many reports. So many people are coming here, and no one is going there. Even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His mentality is becoming like Kaṁsa, I think. At every moment he is thinking, "This Prabhupāda..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who...? Somebody inquired him that "What is this called? So many people are coming." Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He knows no one is coming there. Not very many more people are coming there than are here. Because most of the people come here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they are realizing, that "We are becoming insignificant gradually." That they are realizing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No one goes to Mādhava Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> at all. The only <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> that they still visit is that Śrī Caitanya Maṭha. And they have no money, so that place is becoming so dilapidated that no one is going there either. And there's no life there. There's no young people. There are no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how they can? They cannot feed them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were speaking this morning, Bhavānanda Mahārāja and myself that, we were wondering if we could make like... You know, so many people come here to eat <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> On the weekends, at least two to three thousand people come. So we were wondering whether it would be proper to make some kind of propaganda that "If anyone wants to enroll their children here, their young boys in our <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> that they can..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So a similar counterpart leaflet you should, that "International Society for Krishna Consciousness, world organization, established by His Divine Grace, and anyone can come here and take foodstuff. We have got arrangement," like this. In suitable words you write and issue another pamphlet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengali and in English. Which may not touch there, but we write in our own way that "By the order of his guru he went to America. Then he..." That's a fact. What is the fact, that should be written. Give the list of the books and so on, so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> List of the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, temples. And "He is the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of the present Gauḍīya-sampradāya."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> If we simply state the facts, there is no need for us to subtly infer or to exaggerate because your activities are so glorious that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And invite anyone who is interested to become devotee. We shall provide place, food, education to the children. In this way make another statement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm just wondering... I was thinking whether we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without touching them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. This is... Of course, we'll do this also. What about, like, all of these people coming? This is my point, that so many poor people are coming here. Practically they don't even have enough money to take care of their children properly. So whether we can make some verbal announcements and whether we can set up a little table at the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> pavilion that "Anyone who would like to enroll their sons in our school can do so"? Because many of these people can't take care of their children properly. I'm thinking when they see our boys they may want to give their sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they will give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that a good program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can get many... I think we could get many, many men that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The children, they are enjoying. In the morning they are... That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they're in ecstasy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> All day they enjoy. When they are sweeping the road, they don't know that there's difference between work and play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> To them, sweeping the road is their play. They love it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These children are much more hard working than the children in America. Like these few American boys that are here, they cannot compare with these Bengali boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their service attitude is much, much better. I think we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By association they will be also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, they have also improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jagaman has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Jagaman is wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He works very hard. So I think we should try to get as many of these young boys as we can. We should use the facility of this <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that whether we should... This pamphlet, I don't think it has got any value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has no value, Prabhupāda. What we should do is build this temple. If we just build this temple... This is my point. Let us build this temple immediately. Once this temple is built, everything is finished. All the glowworms are completely extinguished. There will be nothing left. They can do anything they want, and nothing will matter. If they have a 350-foot building with escalators, with huge compounds, then everything is ended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do like that, like America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He can come here and stand outside and scream, "I am the <span class="Italic">ācāryadeva.</span>" Just like in America so many people are saying, "I am Napoleon." No one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That everyone says. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We have to build this temple because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make something like American which is wonderful for the world. So you are Americans. You must do something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we build this temple with escalators and the people go in the temple and they go up the escalator...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They'll never come back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do you think that they're going to then go down the road to go into Śrī Caitanya Maṭha? Why would... What is the point of it after doing something like that? They'll never go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you can arrange some... What is called, that? This helicopter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Helicopter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bringing our men from Dum Dum airport to our roof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are at least four roofs like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. The people will see. All the pilgrims will see. Like the demigods flying in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least we can make a show-it is coming twice in a day and going twice in a day. And they will see that "Oh, so many people are coming."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So you have to... The thing is we're simply waiting for your go-ahead, because unless we get the land and we can begin, we can't start this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa has sent him. Let him come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We shouldn't delay. If we... This is a little pamphlet. If we issue a counter-pamphlet, it's not... I don't think it's such an important thing. The thing to do is to do something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...so significant that this becomes useless. Not that we issue another thing of this nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is already useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I mean, what is the use of issuing another piece of paper against this paper? Let us make a skyscraper temple; then they can think what will be the comparison between this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> On every level. Even the people this invitation was issued to. But they come, and when they come on Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura's appearance day, they all come down the road to here to visit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Even he gives off so much energy inviting this one and that one, they all come. They all want to come down the road. They at least come down for <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes, they have to. They've all been here. They all know it. They come with different personalities, different friends... In Krishnanagar, we are like the cinema in terms of entertainment. As soon as any man, any official, government official, his friends come from Calcutta, immediately they get in one of the government jeeps and they drive out here and come to see the ISKCON Maṭha, Māyāpura Chandrodaya Mandir. Immediately. So many men, they come all the time with their friends from Calcutta. Same thing in Navadvīpa. They come for an evening's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Fully satisfied. The woman puts on her sari, the man dresses up in his <span class="Italic">kurta</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our arrangement should be to give them some <i class="calibre3">p<span class="Italic"></span></i>rasadam, very nice treatment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We've got to do this. We've got to do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if important man should write something in the visitor's... Reception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There should be a reception, proper receptionist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where the reception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will sit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We'll make some arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make it immediately. Reception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That Nitāicānda is really first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nitāicānda is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nitāicānda plus somebody very educated should be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who do we have like that that speaks Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Subhaga. Oh, they love Subhaga. He preaches in the temple at the book table during the busy hours. So many people buy books, and all interested. He's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Subhaga. Subhaga make the chief of the reception. And Nitāicānda his assistant, and another, a foreigner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nitāicānda is in charge of the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He has so much to do, anyway, Nitāicānda. Subhaga is best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Subhaga and two foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As assistants. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make that arrangement. He is very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he is really good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he has understood the philosophy. He has got ten years experience of London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I met him in the London airport and I told him, "Why don't you come to India?" 'Cause I saw him, I thought he'd be really helpful here. So, Prabhupāda, another thing, is there any need to increase our <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution? Right now about a thousand people come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what... They are coming, but if you see that more are coming, then increase. There is no question of advertising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There isn't. We shouldn't advertise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather, you make some arrangement that there'll be <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>-selling there, and anyone comes within the temple give him something. Just like I give here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we don't do that at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Everyone who comes in the temple, they get that <span class="Italic">miṣṭi baḍā..</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Miṣṭi baḍā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Miṣṭi baḍā </span>we give, <span class="Italic">gur</span> and peanut with little coconut in it and <span class="Italic">masalā.</span> We're famous now in the whole area, even Jayapatākā was seeing one government official in Krishnanagar, and he said, "Did you bring me any of that <span class="Italic">baḍā</span>?" They all want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something must be given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, if we get a good cook like Shantilal and he can cook hundreds of <span class="Italic">kachori</span> and we can sell, and then the next room have one men who serves them <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> everyone will come to take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep nice water, sitting place. They will take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of sitting place? On the floor with mats, or benches and tables?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Benches, table will be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Better. Like in a South Indian house. The South Indian restaurants, they have those... Of course, those are fancy, like in Vṛndāvana. In the South Indian restaurant they always have a table with marble top. Then they put a leaf on it. Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There is room down there. That big room can be used as like a restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The next floor down on the end, where they sometimes have class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda wants it up there where they sell the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They will buy in some leaf cup and go next door and have a place to sit down and take it, and then water to wash their... Actually there's a pump. Everything is right there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You will find such confectioner's shop, sitting place and eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Just like in Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have that near the Gopīnātha temple in Vṛndāvana. Everybody goes there. That is very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should make a nice sweet, sweetmeats also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Lugloos</span> is big there. Those <span class="Italic">lugloos.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should make many types of sweetmeats. There should be so many preparations, all offered to the Deity. People can purchase <span class="Italic">mahā-prasādam.</span> It will be very big. When you read in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> every time Caitanya Mahāprabhu's devotees are purchasing <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> from Jagannātha temple, all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It sounds like they make a huge quantity at Purī, huge quantities of foodstuffs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Any time you can get one thousand man's eatables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any time? But we only offer one little plate at<span class="Italic"> ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you can increase as the demand is increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is such a demand in Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone goes. They do not cook. He purchases <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and eat. Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's so famous. Yes, whenever someone visits there they always bring back <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> from Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is... Fifty-six time, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is offered there, fifty-six time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's constant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's constantly being offered all day long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Once offered, <span class="Italic">ārati</span> is performed. Then it is taken away, washed, the room. Again half and hour after... Why half an hour? Fifteen minutes after. Throughout the whole day and night, fifty-six times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Night also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Night..., not night. But up to late night. So fifty-six time, <span class="Italic">chāppānna</span>, within twenty-four hours, so just imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Four or five times an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we have to do that at this temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every fifteen minutes new set, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You need a whole lot of Shantilals to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these ingredients are supplied by Jagannātha's own field. They grow it, and they... So there is no difficulty. They grow and they sell. They get money so they can maintain the establishment. A long time. There are potters. Daily they will supply for each <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> a new pot. It cannot be used again. So few people purchase with pot, original pot, and they have got a fixed price. This big pot, say, five rupees; this pot, two rupees; this pot, one rupee. So as you like, you can purchase. Very nice system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You went there sometimes to take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I became a guest. A gentleman was our tenant, and he gave me introduction letter to his brother-in-law. He was a pleader in Jagannātha Purī. So he received me very well. So he offered me a lunch, and I saw there was something, a small ball-like, in the pot, bowl. So I asked, "What is this?" He said, "It is meat." (laughs) He was eating meat, so he thought it is good reception, the guest is offered nice meat. So I said, "No, you... I never took meat. I never expected..." [break] Then "Never mind." Then I stopped eating there. At that time I was a boy. After appearing in my B.A. examination there was holiday, so I went to Jagannātha Purī in 1920 or something like that. So I was married in 1918. So some of the friends of my wife, they said that "Your husband now gone. He is not coming back." So after returning I understood she was crying. (laughs) So anyway, then I used to purchase <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in the market. They were bringing, and I was eating. I stayed for three, four days. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said that when you were very young you always used to calculate what was the cost of a ticket to Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Every day I was seeing how to go to Jagannātha Purī and how to go to Vṛndāvana. At that time a fare was, for Vṛndāvana, four or five rupees, and similarly for Jagannātha Purī. So I was thinking, "When I shall go?" That's all. I took first opportunity to go to Jagannātha Purī after my examination, and in business connection when I went to Agra, then I first of all took the opportunity to go to Vṛndāvana from Agra. This was in 1925, and I visited Jagannātha Purī sometime in 1920. And '25 I went to Vṛndāvana. I remember, in those days I was sitting within the car, and there was some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> One monkey entered and took away everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the train compartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very clever. Many times in Vṛndāvana the monkeys have taken away from my hand foodstuff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> While you were eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Thrice... At least thrice, four times I remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You wanted them to take it? You were offering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, suppose a big monkey comes and takes. You are stunned. (laughter) You have to give him. No other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will attack otherwise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Rādhā-Dāmodara temple I was cooking the other room. So although the door was closed, he knew, he opened the door and took away my <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Sometimes they would take away... (door opens) Come on. The, what is called, dough? For...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭis</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi.</span> So they will eat that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Raw dough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You gave him some book, this Surendra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was a long time ago I gave one book. Since then you wrote that don't give any books, but that was a long time ago I gave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So you have talked and dealt with him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He came to me and said he wanted a job here. He said he wanted to be our manager, this and that. And then he was hinting about that they were getting one wage, allowance, so he was expecting to get some allowance also, a little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he is coming now. What is the purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> He wanted to be our..., to work for us. To work for Your Divine Grace, maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How did you find him by dealing with him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I didn't find him. He found me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, how you have...? How do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Oh, how did I find... How did...? Well, I know that influentially he is, in the district level, he is very influential. I mean to say that he has got very good relations with all the government people and all the local people. Whenever I go somewhere to invite them for any festival, any function, they would always speak highly of Surendra dāsa and that he had just about a week ago before, he had already invited them for the Caitanya Maṭha. So he is very active in that way, something which we don't have time or understanding to do, so many of us. He knows how to receive people and make them feel very nice and show them around. He has a nice personality like that, and he is very active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you engage, him do you think we shall get some good service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't know the... I know that he is able to perform good service. As far as whether he'll... Other people tell me that since he's been working for the Caitanya Maṭha... (end)</div>
