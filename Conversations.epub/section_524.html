<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...has done, and what everyone likes to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> And then we will decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's nice. That's nice. So I can go on and read these...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I hope this isn't, er... Anyway, this is discussing the responsibilities of the GBC men in their zones. So we've already said to organize opening new temples, to appoint temple presidents for new temples, to be responsible for training all temple presidents and insuring spiritual standards. In the case of major deviation or resignation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, you... First of all, you finish one business. That Oath of Allegiance, so addition, alteration, you have made, complete, so that it may be typed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Satsvarūpa is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The only thing we've done is comment that Asnani's form hasn't specified on devotional principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So make addition, alteration, I say. You amongst yourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, add that one must follow four regulative prin...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I can just add what Brahmānanda Mahārāja has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it amongst yourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda wants to finalize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Discuss and do it, and make a final...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This Oath of Allegiance is a legal document also, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's both a legal document and a spiritual document.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Everything we have is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We cannot avoid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there must be legal also. That's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So somebody can read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So next make this final.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> I recommend that you put Brahmānanda Swami's reco..., on the top part, just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmmm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Brahmānanda Swami's proposals, top portion, we'll just add?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So whatever you make, addition, alteration, make it copied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> And give it to be typed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't keep it. Finish one business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So it's just a matter of typing it, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We can't sign anything now. It's not any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, you are... You make some addition, alteration, to that. So make it complete. Then retype and then sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. Everyone has agreed on what it should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Has everyone agreed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, why don't you read it? Why don't you compose it and then let us all see what it says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If I can read it out loud... Can I have the other...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> We're... Read what the proposal at the top portion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I give Satsvarūpa the whole thing in that...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> All right. So the whole thing, then, would read like... This is a proposal that it should read like this: "I, spiritual name, as initiated disciple, and GBC secretary of His Divine Grace..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Both names should be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, <span class="Italic">prabhuji...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Spiritual and, and, and legal name...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> It should start with this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, it's not sure what it should start with. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Both names should be there because a spiritual name is not legal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Both names. Good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "...as GBC secretary of His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, the founder..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You... You... You make one copy, your copy, and make addition, alteration, corrections, and then copy the same thing for other men. That will be easier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You... You just fill up one copy, as you are doing. So make addition, alteration, your name, your spiritual name, everything complete. So, following that copy, others will do. (?) Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> I recommend that we keep this one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you can make... Anyone, you can take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> In this shape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, you can make addition, alteration, everything, and read it complete. Then take that proposal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So maybe, Atreya Ṛṣi, you can write out a final draft of it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...including both things, and then you can read it to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Where's Brahmānanda Swami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Is that all right? Should we go on while he's writing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We can go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The main purpose of these points is simply to try to put it down in writing what the GBC man can do himself, what things he requires-the whole group-what things he requires to consult with others on, in this way, so there won't be any question "What I can do, what I can't do." Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> O.K. (Reading) "To insure that the highest standards, including spiritual temple worship, <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> propaganda, recruitment of new devotees and life members, financial management and repayment of all debts are being adhered to."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why debts? Debts should be avoided. Not payment, but one should not make debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> But that... All temples... All the temples are in debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That's not... Debts are very wrong. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Either they owe BBT money or they owe bank money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not good. Debts should be... No debts. If any temple wants to make debt, it must be sanctioned by the GBC committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make it clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not that he whimsically, the president, and put the Society into debts, unless it is sanctioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's included in here, more or, more or less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make it clear: "They cannot create any debt."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Just like to come to this festival has put everyone in debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is risky. That is risky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Be very specific about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right. The next point is to insure...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Let me just make sure this is understood. Any, any debts that any temple has, is going to make, has to be approved by the GBC representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When you say debt, do you mean a loan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Loan is also debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. But if they are buying BBT books, if... On the books it may seem debt, but in fact he should know that he's going to pay for it in the very near fu... That you do not consider need approval, do you, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The books are sold on consignment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, and that is all right. That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> If they fall behind, then it becomes a debt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's different. Thirty days pay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> In other words, as long as he meets the terms, it's not a debt. It's not a loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> As soon as it goes over the term, it's unapproved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then a loan where you're paying on time, is that considered a debt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. That's a loan. That has to be approved. That has to be, as much as possible, avoided. In other words, everything you're doing, more or less, on cash basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You don't depend on tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Otherwise, sometimes a president may leave, leaving so many debts, so many loans, so many this, so many that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is our standard of management. Listen. If the temple president doesn't understand it, teach him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. So all these things you write. Otherwise you forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yeah, that, we'll... The next point is to insure that the proper criterion for recommending candidates for initiation be followed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is being done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...and to insure that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The president recommends, or the GBC recommends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is there any fixed amount of time that one has to be in the Society to get first, <span class="Italic">hari-nāma,</span> initiated? Because I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have already fixed, six months to one year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six months to one year. And for <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> One year, you said, after that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, within one year. That's all. If one, within one year, one does not become to the standard, then he's unfit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> The recommendation here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally by the president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, that the president's recommendation is overseeing, is scrutinized, by GBC, so that when Your Divine Grace gets a recommendation, it's been, by someone else, it's been checked. Do you think it's unnecessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If one is not personally sincere, however he is checked...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, so this is unnecessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...then he's useless. Useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> In other words, an addition, "directly," directly... You know we just have to put down what Prabhupāda... Directly president can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally, it is one year after. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Put it down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatirtha:</span> Right, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least not for... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Jayatīrtha, put... "Directly goes..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, after first initiation, one has to wait one year to get second initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> At least six months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Six months after first initiation. All right. So the next role for the GBC man is to act as the designated representative of Śrīla Prabhupāda to settle all philosophic, procedural disputes which may arise and are not settled at the temple level. In other words, any philosophic question a temple president can't ans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> If there's some philosophic question and the temple president can't answer it, then the GBC...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then GBC should be consulted. And if the GBC cannot answer, then I'll answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right. Or, if there's some quarrel-one man doesn't like another man, and the temple president can't solve it-then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is quarrel?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...the GBC man can solve it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of quarrel. Quarrel is material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. But it is the Age of Quarrel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quarrel is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The next point is to obtain reports from the temple presidents, financial reports, like this, to see that things are being looked up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The general report should be submitted at least monthly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. So "to obtain all reports on a timely basis..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To the board of the GBC or to the individual, zonal GBC. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We have kind of a system outlined in here, how reports can be done. It's a technical thing, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they have that everyone is chanting sixteen rounds, everyone is following the principles, "so much money received, so much money deposited in the bank."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "And this is the balance." And these are general (?) report. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right. Yeah, we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The financial means what they have collected, what they have spent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And general reporting: "Yes, everyone is chanting," or "He is not chanting in spite of warning," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So we have some guidelines in here about that. So, so should I go on with this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So then the next thing, besides having a zonal responsibility, a GBC man may have a functional responsibility, like we've already discussed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Functional, main functional responsibility is to go and see that the temple regular work is going on, the president is doing nicely, to check in this way. You can sit down in the class, in the..., and see how things are going on. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's it. Now, one point we've included that we haven't really done before is the idea of establishing committees and individual service...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Committee, I shall appoint also, if there is any need. Amongst the GBC, I shall pick up some members and make a committee for a particular...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> For example, we put down that there may be a regional committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Just like in Europe, we have a regional committee for managing, I understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that regional co...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Isn't it Bhagavān, Haṁsadūta...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have said that Haṁsadūta, Bhagavān and Brahmānanda may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So it's a kind of regional committee for managing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So we similarly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we can change also. For the time being, it is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> I think what Śrīla Prabhupāda has said to us is that if we have very close cooperation, the spirit of committee consultation always exists...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Like if Bhagavān dāsa is in U.S., then Satsvarūpa Mahārāja and Rūpānuga Prabhu will consult with him, like they always consult with each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> They should always... And this spirit should go on amongst the twelve. Or if I'm in Tehran, and if there is a financial matter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Don't bring politics. Then it will be ruined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. The spirit should be that you write me and ask me, and I will give you all the service that I can. This should come in us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> For example, in the United States...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not so much, necessarily, committees and formal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if a committee is necessary, it should be decided, first stage, decided by the GBC, and I'll give final sanction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> For example, one committee that I would propose is in the United States, since we share so many similar problems and so many problems overlap...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you... No, the GBC is already there. But that is... Committee is there, the whole committee. But for any special purpose, if committee is required...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Another example of a kind of committee would be some projects. Say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Project will be decided by the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Say, the Gurukula, for example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I have elected this committee in Europe because the German trouble is going on. When the German trouble is over, there is no need of committee. It is only for this particular purpose because there we have to defend court, we have to see... So two, three heads, not one head. One head may be puzzled. Committee means for special purposes. Otherwise, the standing committee, GBC, is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just as a question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I appointed the committee to investigate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bali Mardana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that committee is not standing. Yet similarly, a committee may be formed for some special circumstances, but otherwise the GBC committee is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The main point about that is that the GBC, we all meet together once a year...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And form all, what is to be discussed, what you are going to do, future. Just like you can discuss the German affairs, and find out how to defend ourselves. Of course, it is in the hands of the lawyer. Still, we can suggest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Take, for another example, there's the ISKCON Food Relief Program. Now, last year we discussed this, but no one was given any specific responsibility for it, and nothing really has been... Some money has been collected, but nothing major has been done. My idea would be that if there were a committee, say, of two, three men formed who would conjointly discuss and work on these projects, such as this ISKCON Food Relief, then more would get done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, I think it's entirely an individual...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think this Oath of Allegiance should be signed by the presidents also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not only the GBC, but the president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I just want to ask a question. We're in a... This meeting right now is concerning ISKCON and the GBC, but are we going to have some kind of meeting regarding the BBT? Because that's a very pressing matter also. Is that going to come in in these discussions, or are we going to have a separate meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The BBT I am conducting personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you mentioned in Miami... This is the reason I'm bringing it up. In Miami we mentioned that we would be discussing at Māyāpur. Something, you know, should be done so that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that something? The first something is that everyone is complaining that they are not getting books. You just, first of all, do it, how to stop these complaints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We got to get the books (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> This is the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The India is membership, and the members, if they are dissatisfied, then? This is not good. So find out the way how this complaint can be solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So does it mean that the BBT should take charge of the Life Membership program or to see that they're supplied the books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Life Membership... Suppose you make one Life, he has to be supplied books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So fifty percent goes to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Book Fund.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in the BBT. That is the main purpose, that fifty percent must go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> For printing. Fifty percent for printing, fifty percent for building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. This is the main purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But the difficulty is that in India there's no other source of income besides the Life Membership. How they will maintain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the...? That you discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, a meeting. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you discuss, how these sources, how their maintenance should be... But BBT is already declared. It is meant for two purposes. Now you find out how the sources. That is business of GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That we can discuss afterwards?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The BBT, that, it should be: how the complaints should be stopped, and if they have no other income, then how things should be managed. That is... GBC should discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> In other words, Śrīla Prabhupāda, BBT is not outside ISKCON. BBT is part of ISKCON, and GBC is in charge of all ISKCON. But in this case, BBT, you have your personal attention, so since you are the supreme authority in ISKCON, you will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, one thing is that sometimes before, Jayatīrtha suggested that if the ISKCON goes to liquidation, then the BBT also will be affected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is only a legal matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Legal matter. So I want to protect BBT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Legally, you will want. But, in fact, GBC is also concerned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you are concerned. You do this-now how to stop these complaints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they want to maintain from the GBC income. How this can be avoided, you consider.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. It is not something we forget because it's BBT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But these are the important problems, that the, here in India, the members are complaining. Sometimes they are sending complaining to me. So the first business is how to, how the collection from the membership is being dispersed, how the money is being dispersed. Suppose I... He is a member. I take him, 222. Then how the money is being sent? So you see first of all that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a GBC matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is GBC matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I would like to ask a question. Just like in the... Now, this is one point to consider. Now, another point is, which we have put off until this meeting, especially to be considered in this meeting, is the moving of the Press. The moving of ISKCON Press. Is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you decide amongst the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that a GBC matter or BBT matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is GBC, er, yeah, GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I want to see, as the chairman of the BBT, that fifty percent is spent on printing and fifty percent is for constructing temples. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And who sees to that? The GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means, practically speaking, the management... The BBT is separate from ISKCON for legal purposes, but the management of it is done by the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> However, at the present, Prabhupāda himself is heading this management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's heading every management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> But in this particular case he's heading it very particularly. This is something...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because it's very sensitive issue. It doesn't mean separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But now, we discussed this... We discussed this before, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You said that you didn't... You wanted to make some more BBT members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I require, I can make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The reason I'm bringing this up is because, heretofore, the BBT has been managed by one or two trustees, and the point is that maybe it is best that it be managed by the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that... First of all manage these things. Then you will, it will be included in the trustees. First of all show your capacity that you have managed these things very nicely, these two things. Why there should be complaint? How you can solve it? And why the temples should be maintained by collection of the BBT? It is meant for printing and constructing temples. Why should (we) violate the purpose of the Trust? So first of all you manage these two things. Then, if you want, you can come. If the problem remains the same, then what is the use of increasing heads?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> What is obvious is that Prabhupāda's interference has always come because we have not done our jobs right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> He would very much like to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the real purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> He would... As soon as we show that we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Work together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Work together and manage nicely, he wants to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, so far the... Just like in Germany. They unnecessarily take the money while there is creditor, printer. There was no need of keeping money. Go on paying them. That was my policy. I instructed Karandhara that whenever there is collection, go to pay. That arrangement I made with Dai Nippon, that "I shall go on paying. You don't ask me." So he never asked me. You know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as there is collection, I paid him: "And you go on printing these books." This should be the policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is very important that we understand. This is not common in the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> world, that Śrīla Prabhupāda does not like credit or playing with money and saving it or something... You have a debt; you pay it; you don't create debt. Everything is just very honest and very flowing. This I have to learn myself because this is not the way the business world is, although I do a lot of business. And we all have to see that this policy is followed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This complaint from the members is not at all good. If somebody becomes envious, he can file a suit that "These men have collected money from me, eh, but not supplied books."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They sign a document we also sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We sign one document when they become a member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And they sign also. It's a contract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the first thing, that the GBC maintains here. Immediately the collection is there-fifty percent goes to the BBT account, and fifty percent goes to the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> May I recommend, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that one GBC member, plus GBC India be appointed to look very carefully into this whole si...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Be appointed. Do this. Be appointed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. We will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> To investigate this whole...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why...? Just stop this complaint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> This whole membership program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am giving you the appointment. Do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We can consult with him later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So we'll discuss it and try to find out the details...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Put it in the agenda, this membership plan, immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...later on</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These complaints are not at all good. They have become very serious. Complaint must be stopped. Why they are...? Now print cheap edition here and give them books. Sell also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They cannot accuse of being cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They cannot accuse us of cheating them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not good at all. Why there is complaint?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So make the agenda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I have nine points on the agenda so far.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Śyāmasundara. He was appointed the BBT member. And what he is doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's been a very high attrition rate on GBC...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's been a very high attrition rate on BBT trustees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this thing should be arranged first of all. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So the... There are a number of points that require discussion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So discuss...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I don't know, necessarily, that it's your desire to have them discussed in your presence or, for example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't want, but if you want, you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, we always love to have your association, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> What about if you, at least, can approve the agenda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> If you can give us your blessings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you discuss, some of the agenda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The agenda that we've created so far is... The first point on the agenda is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. You said that that should be our first point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa conscious movement means... It is very practical. Because our consciousness is now polluted... Just like water. Water, originally, crystal clear water. But as soon as it touches the ground, it becomes dirty, muddy. So our consciousness-originally clear, Kṛṣṇa consciousness: "Kṛṣṇa is my eternal master. I am eternal servant." This is real consciousness. Now, since we have come into this material world, we have made, instead of Kṛṣṇa, "My wife is my master, my society is my master, my country is my master, my political leader is my master," so many. So the Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to purify the dirty things and then... So, to purify this, Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> cleaning the mirror of consciousness, this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> This is only way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> So that's the first point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the first point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And the next point ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We should know that our consciousness is now polluted. The... Exactly like this: Clear water falls down from the sky, and as soon as come in contact with the ground, it becomes muddy. You can take the water again and filter, and then again clear. Again crystal clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> By nature water is clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And sometimes it can become polluted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the whole devotional service means <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> That is the recommendation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, cleansing the dirty-politically, socially, communally, and internationally, nationally... In this way, it is all contaminated. So that, that is called <span class="Italic">upādhi,</span> unnecessary. Just like water. You bring the colored water. That is contamination, not crystal. So these are different colors. So you have to strain the water from different colors. Then that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Consciousness is already there. So instead of thinking Kṛṣṇa, that "I am Kṛṣṇa's," I am thinking, "I am my family's. I am my, my cat's, my dog's, my nation's, my community's..." This thinking is opposite Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And when you simply think that "I am Kṛṣṇa's," that's all. That is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So, so the agenda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Just applicable to myself, it's very easy to think that "Now I am in a position of responsibility. I may be most advanced." But what your instruction is that I always think that this position of responsibility requires that I become pure, so I have to be very, very careful. I am not most advanced. I have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That purity process is chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> I have to chant very carefully...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...and very seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Offenseless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not that I'm already advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Offenseless chanting, that will purify. That is the easiest process, given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Ceto-da...</span>(?) He first of all recommends cleansing the heart. And as soon as your heart is cleansed, then you become immediately purified. This is the way. So be always engaged, either in chanting or reading or preaching. Then it will be clarified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is actually a very easy process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the easiest process. There is no secondary process. Chanting. And it is recommended by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, the authority, <span class="Italic">param vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.</span> So many things will happen.</div>
<div class="Verse">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śreyaḥ-kairava candrikā-vitaraṇaṁ vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam<br class="calibre2"/>ānandāmbudhi-vardhanaṁ prati-padaṁ pūrṇāmṛtasvādanaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>(sarvātma-snapanaṁ) paraṁ vijāyate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Cc.

<div class="After-Verse">This is His recommendation. We haven't got to invent something. It is there already. You do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So the agenda for the GBC meeting to decide on... First of all, Jagadīśa has made one proposal for financing Gurukula, if it has to be discussed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Financing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Gurukula is having some serious financial difficulties. So Jagadīśa has made a proposal, which we'll discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So everyone's son is there, all devotees' son. So from every center some contribution should be given to the Gurukula.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> That was my proposal. That becomes a kind of tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> In a sense, it's like a school tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, at the same time, it should be examined how Gurukula is spending money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. Jagadīśa has made a complete report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not unnecessarily spending. That is the duty of the GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, about this tax, about this money to be taken from each temple. Gurukula is one of the projects. For example, there may be another project...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...that Your Divine Grace and group, when you travel, there needs to be also... Every temple should contribute to that as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, if every temple cannot contribute, I shall manage from the BBT fund. That is not a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You want...? I am using that merely as a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you can pay, it is all right. If there is deficit, BBT will pay. You don't bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. But in this Gurukula project, Śrīla Prabhupāda, temples are having difficulty in paying their debts to BBT already. I don't think they will respond, respond. On one hand, BBT, Ramesvara Prabhu is recommending that we reduce the cost of books, and on the other hand, it's being recommended that the tax for Gurukula be collected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, cost of book... Cost of books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not cost. Price of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, price of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cost of selling price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That we discussed with you in Dallas, Ramesvara and I.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There is no need. There is no need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> So what I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a fact that by reducing the price you'll sell more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, no. Not reducing the price to the public. Reducing the cost to the temple, so the temple can make more profit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That we discussed with you in Dallas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> What I am recommending is that, instead of reducing the charge to the temple and then collecting a separate tax, do not reduce the charge to the temple. Whatever reduction you were going to give, give that reduction to Gurukula.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Then that means that BBT is paying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, BBT is not paying. You're going to give them a reduction. Don't give it to them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That means giving them unlimited money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That means giving them unlimited money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No. Well, for example, let's say I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If I distribute more books, then Gurukula gets more money. Then... They don't need all that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This... This is... Contribution is better for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Separate contribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Does that, does that... What about those temples that don't have any children there in Gurukula. Because it seems that the problem is not just that... There are people besides devotees who are not paying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can give.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's part of the proposal. Why not discuss in relationship to the proposal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right. We have the whole proposal. Everyone has a copy, I think. So we can discuss that. The main point, I'm just saying now, is to read through the agenda and see if Prabhupāda approves that we're talking about these things, and then..., because these things are so detailed, and we have some proposals in writing. We can discuss them more. Anyway, so one proposal is Gurukula finance. Another proposal is Brahmānanda's made some proposals about Africa, specifically manpower to be sent to Africa. Another proposal... another thing is to discuss the BBT, BBT loans, moving of the Press, several points about BBT, lowering of the prices, these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the advantage of moving the Press?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That Ramesvara should be here to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Call (?) Ramesvara. If you be..., all GBC agrees, then you do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All right. So if we have a separate meeting, and Ramesvara presents his proposals nicely, and everyone agrees, then we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You consider, and then you decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So that's one thing to discuss. Another thing to discuss is Spiritual Sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Don't you think that there should be some representatives from the Press at that meeting too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, they'll be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the Spiritual Sky... I have heard that you are paying two thousand rupees, er, two thousand dollars, per month to the accountant, and one thousand dollars to Karandhara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Seventeen hundred dollars a month to the accountant, full-time accountant. That is the average price in America for a first-class accountant. Otherwise, we have to hire, get Atreya Ṛṣi to come and do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Karandhara is taking one thousand dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, here's the problem, that because it is a business, people must, that work there, have to get regular salary and pay taxes. Otherwise we can get in a lot of trouble. We can get in a lot of trouble. Maybe Bhagavān may know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Well, I have the same thing in France. Spiritual Sky is a legal business. That means you have to legally employ people. But I employ the temple people and just take their salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Do you take Karandhara's salary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No, that's a different thing. Anyway, let me finish the point. The point is that legal salary has to be paid, and then taxes have to paid from that. So for example, Karandhara's salary is not really a good example because he doesn't give fifty percent. But one thousand dollars is the salary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Minimum? Minimum salary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That eight hundred, two hundred goes for taxes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No our, our... That was the... Formerly, who was managing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Formerly, I was managing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you were also taking one thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I was... But that was... But I was... I wasn't taking anything. But that was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? How...? Why he is taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Because we were working illegally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The thing is the whole situation has deteriorated into a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> business, and no one's making any profit on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, now, let's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's just a headache.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That is a... That is an unschooled statement, an uneducated statement. It's not a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, that's not a fact. Where is the advantage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Anyway, let me finish... That's why I don't want to discuss this in front of Prabhupāda, because of argument. Anyway, the next point is that, as far as Karandhara's salary is concerned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Spiritual Sky was contemplated that our <span class="Italic">gṛhastha bhaktas</span> may be employed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, but they're not employed anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's not true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the bare necessities should be paid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Right. Well, generally we have about seventeen, eighteen <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> employed in Los Angeles, and they get much smaller salary, and they, for the most part, they're giving everything over subsistence to the temple as donation. They take out minimum subsistence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Karandhara is not giving anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Well, his point is... As you know, he made that unauthorized loan from BBT when he left, for five thousand dollars. And he has to pay it back at three hundred dollars per month. So after he makes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unauthorized loan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> When he left last year, he took loan for five thousand dollars, and he is repaying at three hundred dollars per month. So after taxes, he gets eight hundred dollars. Three hundred dollars goes to BBT. That's five hundred. Now, with the balance, he supports his wife and children, and his wife is giving donations for Deities and so on. So he is not actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that you discuss whether he is... Otherwise I can give you a very first-class man, but he won't charge anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I'll not disclose. (laughter) You give him simply, his wife and him, a shelter. He's Indian, I can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is qualified man. He can do. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> But he's not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Karandhara's management is-I mean I'm just looking at it from another view-is worth more than two thousand dollars. So if he is getting only one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your management is not worth five thousand dollars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Mine is worth nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are giving free service? Anyone, all of my disciples, they are qualified. Their service is worth more than any thousands of... Yes. So why you are maintaining Karandhara? All of them, they are giving free service. But they are all worthy to take salary, two thousand, three thousand, five thousand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Karandhara is only, what he's getting is only enough for his maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> We are being maintained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Maintenance... Here, everyone can earn money and maintain him, but here this expense should be sacrifice. The essential is service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's his service...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Service, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It was started for that reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we take payment, that is not service. That is business. That is business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It is, no doubt, a fact that Karandhara is not giving his full, is giving his full life as service. That is a fact. It may be taken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our organization is to give service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And then another point in this connection is that when I was in Los Angeles last time, all the people that worked for Spiritual Sky, they were, they were starting to fall away because of Karandhara's <span class="Italic">karmic</span> attitude...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this point you discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> (to Haṁsadūta:) That problem we'll discuss, and I'll discuss it with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there are also two reports we don't have here, and we should read those before... One is Karandhara's report, and one is Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Prabhu's report, who have investigated this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He's told us to make his report.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Hm? Well, yes, that we have not heard yet. So we should hear and read the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All have contact. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> ...and then discuss this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is your GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All right. So that we'll discuss. The other thing we'll discuss is ISKCON Food Relief. And we'll also discuss the complaints about books in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the main...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So these things we can discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...how these complaints can be stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> The pledge. Should I read the pledge? I have written it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What about the situation in Germany?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> All right, situation in Germany we'll also discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Put the pledge on the agenda, Prabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> You want to read that pledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> You want me to read it, Prabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone may hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> I... The same pledge, that the Indian gentleman has written, where it says, "Prabhupāda, I, Mr. So and So, <span class="Italic">karmī</span> name, initiated name in parenthesis, date of birth, at present residing at, of certain nationality, do hereby solemnly affirm, declare and state as under as follows: I state I have been elected or nominated a member of Governing Body Commission, under the recommendation of my Guru Mahārāja, His Divine Grace A.C.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The four regulative principles should be stated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that may not be. We know, everyone.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yeah, it should be mentioned.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> If it was in parentheses, it would be better for a legal document.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I may give direction according to the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> "Or" means both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> "Or" can mean... All right. "Or through his commissioners..."(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Direct, direct instruction is important. Just like Kṛṣṇa. In the books He has given many instructions, but then He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityaja.</span> If one says that "You gave me instruction before like this. How can I give up this?" so that is not important. The direct instruction is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> "To me from time to time directly by my aforesaid Guru Mahārāja, or through his commissioner..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> It's not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You mean the part about the books, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You mean the part about the books?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is to protect, like, if somebody chanting sixteen rounds...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's redundant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, I thought if someone was chanting sixteen rounds and following the principles and reading someone else's books, like Siddha-svarūpa's people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, but we've just already read one portion where it says that we will follow direct instructions of Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So again he's repeating it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instruction, follow that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> So then it's not necessary about this "only" sort part of...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> What if there is no direct instruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I don't think that part is anymore important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> "I further state that I am holding monies and movable and immovable..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why he's...? He's not holding money, GBC.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> So this I'll take out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, GBC, practically does not hold any money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You can say, "Any monies or properties under my direction..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That's what it should say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Under, under his direction. Any monies or properties under his direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> That would be a separate oath. That would be a separate thing, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Maybe that should just be left out because if we're going to have some legal document like an umbrella, then that will take care of all those things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Well, that should be in the pledge, in the agenda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, GBC... Does GBC members deal with money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, he does not personally. He doesn't have anything personal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But he puts his signature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> No, no. As GBC, we do not deal with money. In other words, if you're dealing with money, it's the temple president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The GB...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Not as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The GBC should see that it is being done properly. Why he should...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But sometimes it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...involve himself in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Well, for example, in New York...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...internal management?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Well, in New York, for example, I just recently signed with Gopī-jana-vallabha Prabhu the papers on the farm. I signed conjointly with him on the farm because the officers had to sign, and we just recently had a thing in New York, ISKCON, Los Angeles, New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, "sign" another thing. That I have signed, many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The one thing is that GBC is wandering. If the checks are to be signed, then where is the GBC?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There's no account, no GBC account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The... The money matters should be dealt with the president, secretary and the treasurer, three men. Out of three, two should sign. And GBC's business is to see that things are going on, money matters. That's all. GBC is not supposed to deal directly. He has to inspect. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> So I can cross this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like... But the thing is, if the GBC and the president is the same man, that is not good. That is not good. The president should be separate. So the president, treasurer and secretary, they will deal directly, and GBC should inspect book, account, that it is done very nicely. That's all. You can question, "Why you have done this?" That's nice. Otherwise, in the..., it will be difficult to manage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes. We don't want to become entangled in that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We don't want to become entangled in that money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> What controls? What controls in the matter of money then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Who has control of the money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Control means if there is vigilant, I mean to say, examination, inspection, then there is control of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, let's say someone gives the temple president some money, and he puts in an account with his name and the treasurer's name, and they both conspire and take the money. Then there's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you can do also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Anyway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> GBC can do also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But isn't the GBC supposed to be more trusted than the temple president?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then everyone can do, who has got the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The BBT trustees did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The BBT trustees also did it. They took unsanctioned loan from the BBT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, what about in a case like myself. I'm a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> and I have a traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. So can I handle that money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> with a travelling preaching party. So I have no... Because I am personally seeing to the money, tbere's no debt on that party. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you decide amongst the GBC. (laughter) Best thing is that don't keep money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I have no money in my name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you don't... You spend the necessary expenditure, and balance money, you give whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, yeah. We're doing... I meant to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> is collecting and spending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> There you have a function of, more or less of a president, as well as the GBC, in that party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Which is... In that case, it has to have GBC approval.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So we can adjourn for lunch and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can... Till next we meet again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So the rest of these things we can discuss in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> ...separate meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (all offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Oh, he's not... He did not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No, they went and told him to come and he said, "I'm just now coming." (end)</div>
