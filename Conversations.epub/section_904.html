<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is our farm up in here. Lord Jagannātha is staying there now while He is ill. Our big Lord Jagannātha is going to Cleveland tomorrow for Ratha-yātrā festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. It is the first time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. They have a big cart, and they will go down the main street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How far it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> How far to Cleveland? About 130 miles. [break] Our land is on the left side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So this land, how you are utilizing it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We are growing a kind of grass, sudan grass. Then we cut that and put it in the tall silos for the cows to eat in the winter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the winter this is all covered with snow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Most of the winter not. We get maybe six inches during the whole winter. [break] ...a lot of land now that's not our land. We are farming a lot of land now that is not our land. We lease it, or do it on shares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What is the share, half?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Sometimes half, more likely a third, sometimes a quarter. We like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quarter for the proprietor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. There are many people that have a lot of land, and they don't want to do it themselves. But the hay has to be cut every year, otherwise the trees come, and then the land degenerates. So they like to have it cut. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...land can be cultivated also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, it could be. It would be very good land. [break] ...our own lumber now also. Cutting our own trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the nature's way. You cut the lumber and make cottage, and the land is clear, then cultivate, get you food, and cows, give them grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> [break] ...woods around here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is there is no fog here? Due to the trees? It is clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> There's a river up that way, and I think there's more fog up that-it's always like that, I don't know exactly why. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in the jungle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Deer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deer only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Few fox.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fox also. And fox, they come to our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Fox, they eat men? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Not usually. Only if they get sick, rabies, then they'll attack. They eat rabbits and rodents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deer also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Deer are vegetarian, they eat grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Fox will eat the deer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Oh, I don't think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Saw a lynx, a big cat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> A lynx, a small cat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Something like a little wildcat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They eat, they're eaten by the fox?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They'll eat the fox. They're very rare though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">ahastāni sahastānām<br class="calibre2"/>apadāni catuṣ-padām<br class="calibre2"/>phalgūni tatra mahatāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jīvo jīvasya jīvanam</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The handless animal is the food for the animal with hands. This is the beginning of life. Uncivilized man eats the animals. <span class="Italic">Apadāni catuṣ-padām:</span> these grass, plants, they are for the <span class="Italic">catuṣ-padām,</span> four-legged. Cows, deer, goats, they eat. And those who are weak, they are for the strong. In this way, this is the nature's way. <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> One life, a living entity is food for another. (dogs barking) Immigration department. (laughter) We have got passport. (laughter) That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> This is a dog's business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dog's business. Without any fault, they'll chastise. We have no fault, still they are chastising. <span class="Italic">Durlabhaṁ mānuṣaṁ janma.</span> You have got this independence. Little independence, more than the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It's the end of the road, so I think we can turn here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break].... in the kitchen, this wood or gas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Both. Mostly wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many jungles, we can use wood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Actually we like it better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, it is better, nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But it is a little dirty. Unless you change it to charcoal, there was always some smoke. This is not ours. Our property comes down this way, but not on this corner. [break] ...land, Prabhupāda, and they say overpopulation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the beginning, I protest against this assertion, there is overpopulation. I never admitted. Perhaps you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no overpopulation. If the Americans allow the Chinese and the Indians to come, they can develop all these un.... "No, this is our land, you cannot come," immigration, <span class="Italic">gow gow.</span> [break] ...creek is pure water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, the water around here is very nice. We can dam it and have big lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no foam that means it is nice water. Foam means sinful water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa explains that the soul is situated in the body but he's not the performer of activities. In other words, he does nothing within the body, and yet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is said he does nothing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's a verse that says the self-realized soul, when he sees the activities of evacuation or moving or so many things, he understands that it is the body alone which is working. So how is it that we see in a dead body, when the soul has gone, there are none of these activities? So it appears, though, the soul is the principle in the body that is performing all these activities. Otherwise, how is it that the dead body, when the soul is gone, is also not carrying on so many functions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long the soul is there, the activities of the body are there. Otherwise not. That is explained-habit. Knowingly, unknowingly. Just like a child is passing urine. He does not know that he's passing, but the body's action is going on like that. But if the child is dead, there will be no more passing. Like that. So long the body is alive, things are happening automatically. Just like this tree, so long it is alive the leaves are coming out, the flowers are coming out, although the trees have no developed consciousness. (pause) In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> we see that when Nanda Mahārāja felt some disturbances from the demons, they decided to change the place. And they immediately, from Gokula, they immediately went to Vṛndāvana. But we don't find anything that they had to take permission. Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means formerly this was the system. If there is any vacant land, one can go and live there. There's no question of permission. When you live there and you make your professional activities, then the king will come, take little tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> That used to be the system here. They called it "homesteaders." If you would go and make you home there, you could have the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not for the foreigners. If some Chinese men or Indian want to come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It used to be. But not anymore for anybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Because it has become very profitable for people to keep it. Because people are making money on it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money they must make; otherwise, why they should come? But what is the objection? Just like in the marketplace, still, in India, the system is, the marketplace, anyone can go and sell his goods, and when he's selling, the proprietor takes some contribution. Not that he has to take permission. He's selling there, that's all right, "Give me some..., a little contribution." The king has the right to tax for maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, when we take that which is not our quota, by using, wasting a lot of clean water, how is that perfect and complete, <span class="Italic">oṁ pūrṇam</span>? How are things still perfectly complete even when we're wasting and destroying it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should waste? Wasting is not allowed. [break] ...our car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, it belonged to the man who formerly owned the property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how it is broken?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Some vandals. There's no one living here, he just left it. (in car:) This farm is for sale now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no limit of purchasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Only limit is money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say as in India there is limit, that you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> No, government puts no limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no land, therefore there is limit. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Cauliflower, peas, beets, carrots, lettuce, spinach...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Potato, broccoli,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Broccoli? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It is something like cauliflower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's that green vegetable, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that's like cauliflower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cabbage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Cabbage, peppers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice, so many. Tomato.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But most things are not yet fructified. This is early in our season. Peas will be ready just shortly. Lettuce is ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vegetables, <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> milk, wheat, then what do you want more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> The wheat is just about ready for harvest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say we can grow all these things and eat very nicely. Where is economic problem? <span class="Italic">Yajñād bhavati parjanyo parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It's full of cow stool and urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā,</span> for fertilizer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes, fertilizer. Nothing is wasted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can make gas also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Yes. That was originally an oil tank. (end)</div>
