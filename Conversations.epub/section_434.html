<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Science and knowledge for man, and it is a manual. And he has an <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> here. And this is our spiritual master, His Divine Grace Bhaktivedanta Swami. Monsieur Roost does not speak English, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> I understand a little, but I cannot speak easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> But I want to know from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a little technical subject, so translation. We... Our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there is yoga practice also. So we approve this yoga practice. There is no doubt. And in the Vedic literature it is said, <span class="Italic">dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The yogis, they also sees the Absolute Truth by meditation within the mind. So this process is approved process, and there are divisions. <span class="Italic">Sagarbha-yogī, nirgarbha-yogī</span> (?). So what is your special subject matter of yoga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> I try to make a yoga with understanding from occident... I saw that occidental people is more intellectual, and I don't understand very easily the <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> The dynamics and... I don't understand we must work without, without goal, without intention, without personal intention. And I try to show through the practice of <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga</span> that posture and <span class="Italic">prāṇāyāma</span> and concentration. I try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beginning from abdomen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> The kind of meditation I learned in India with Swami Satyananda, it's a few different type meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They begin from the abdomen, <span class="Italic">maṇipūraka, maṇipūraka.</span> And then the intestines. They come to the heart; then ultimately, to the <span class="Italic">brahma-randhra.</span> This practice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Yes, it's a practice of <span class="Italic">kuṇḍalinī-yoga,</span> but very, very temperate, moderate. It is not the <span class="Italic">kuṇḍalinī-yoga</span> with strong <span class="Italic">prāṇāyāma.</span> It's more a question of conscious of awareness of breathing and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Awareness of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Breathing. For example, breathing which starts in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāṇāyāma,</span> this is <span class="Italic">prāṇāyāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> And you must have the conscious of your breathing from <span class="Italic">rodha</span> to <span class="Italic">ājñā,</span> and <span class="Italic">ājñā</span> through the <span class="Italic">Rājadvāra</span> (?) column to <span class="Italic">mūlādhāra.</span> This is one example. And it's a general technique of concentration. For example, to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I already said, <span class="Italic">dhyānāvasthita, dhyāna avasthita. Dhyāna</span> means meditation, and situated, <span class="Italic">avasthita.</span> <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā,</span> by mind, <span class="Italic">paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ.</span> So these processes are approved, but they are more or less on the bodily concept of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Is according to...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they are in the bodily concept of life. They are working day and night trying to improve the material condition of life, not only in this life, but also in the next life. They are performing different ritualistic ceremonies for being promoted to the heavenly planet, like that. So they are all <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> Either in this world or in the next world, they are called <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> So <span class="Italic">karmī</span> means they want comfort of this body. And the yogis, they are also on the concept of this body. They are identifying this body as designated <span class="Italic">Brahman, upādhi-brahma, "Brahman</span> with designation." But their central point is this body. That... This bodily concept of life, so long it continues in the form of <span class="Italic">karma-yogī</span> or <span class="Italic">dhyāna-yogī,</span> it can give him relief from the cycle of birth and death and merge into the <span class="Italic">Brahman</span> effulgence. <span class="Italic">Brahma-sāyujya-mukti,</span> this is called, technically. The <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> also. But that is not final. There is still farther. Even there is <span class="Italic">brahma-sārūpya-mukti, brahma-sālokya-mukti, brahma-sarṣṭi-mukti.</span> So generally, the yogis and the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they aim at <span class="Italic">brahma-sāyujya-mukti,</span> to merge into the <span class="Italic">Brahman</span> effulgence. But that is not final. Final is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> After advancing, if the yogi gets the chance of associating with pure devotee and he engages himself in the transcendental loving service of the Lord, that is final perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> I think so. But this, the ultimate, is very, very far for European people, I think. It's like in the yoga of Patañjali, it's eight-part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṣṭāṅga-yoga, aṣṭāṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">aṣṭāṅga-yoga.</span> The last part of the evolution. I think first we must through the body find the balance. With the balance of our body, we can go after the balance of our ego, of cessation, and after this, perhaps, we are able to sacrifice all to the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sacrifice for whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Yes. Without intention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The Lord, he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Without personal intention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I'm sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sacrifice. Intention means personal intention. Otherwise, intention to satisfy the Lord, that is required. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> We are not intentionless, but purified intention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> And what is your practice? Technically, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, technically, it begins with hearing, <span class="Italic">śravaṇam,</span> to hear about God. Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We hear from God personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> But with... Through lecture? Through sound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, through sound vibration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> And repeat and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śabdād anāvṛttiḥ.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> there is, "By hearing the sound, one becomes immortal." So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> It's like <span class="Italic">japa-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is later. That is later on. For beginning you have simply to give submissive aural reception. That is the first beginning. <span class="Italic">Sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ.</span> Our process is <span class="Italic">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya.</span> I know something or I can know the Supreme by my knowledge. As I am something, I am very important, our process is to forget this first of all. This is called humbleness, submissive. Generally, the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> yogis, they are thinking that they can do something by their own endeavor. Our process is different, that "I am limited. My endeavor is limited. My knowledge is limited. So I cannot realize the unlimited by these limited resources." This is our first submission, <span class="Italic">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya,</span> that "I am limited; I am not unlimited." That's a fact. So how can I know the unlimited by my limited activities? This is our first submissiveness. Just like in the Vedic literature it is stated that Mahā-Viṣṇu, the plenary expansion of Govinda, from His breathing innumerable universes are coming and going. <span class="Italic">Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya jīvanti loma-vilajā jagad-aṇḍa-nāthāḥ [Bs. </span>5.48]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we cannot conceive even of this universe. And innumerable universes are coming and going during the breathing period of Mahā-Viṣṇu. And that Mahā-Viṣṇu is the plenary expansion of Govinda. So this is the position of Govinda. So therefore our process is not to try by our limited endeavor to understand the unlimited. This is our first proposal. Better be submissive and hear from the Lord or from the representative of the Lord about Him. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva.</span> Call Nitāi.</div>
<div class="Verse">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva<br class="calibre2"/>jīvanti san-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām<br class="calibre2"/>sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir<br class="calibre2"/>ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's first admission, that this way, one can... Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāne prayāsam udapāsya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That's Tenth Canto, Chapter Fourteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You can find out in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> In the Kṛṣṇa Book we find out when Brahmā is offering prayers to Kṛṣṇa. Brahmā is offered, I think, first part.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This is in English. What would it be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> It would be about the fourteenth paragraph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> We don't know this universe, so there are so many innumerable universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fourteenth paragraph, what is written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Fourteenth is "Lord Brahmā admitted that his birth was from the lotus flower which blossomed from the navel of Nārāyaṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Here it says 10.14.3, the third paragraph.</div>
<div class="Verse">jñāne prayāsam udapāsya namanta eva<br class="calibre2"/>jīvanti san-mukharitāṁ bhavadīya-vārtām<br class="calibre2"/>sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir<br class="calibre2"/>ye prāyaśo 'jita jito 'py asi tais tri-lokyām</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jito 'pi. Jito py asi tais tri-lokyām.</span> Where we have explained in English. What is the...? <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā,</span> Eighth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Not here. It's in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Eighth Chapter we have translated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes. Manuscript is there in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We have published this book up to Eleventh Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Not published yet, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this book, this <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That is <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> not <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, not <span class="Italic">Madhya-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No. Third paragraph, it should begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The third paragraph of the chapter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Fourteen. Yeah, let me see it to read it. So it says here, "The best process of understanding You is to submissively give up the speculative process and try to hear about You either from Yourself, as You have given statements in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and many other similar Vedic literatures, or from a realized devotee, who has taken shelter at Your lotus feet. One has to hear from a devotee without speculation. One does not even need to change his worldly position. Simply he has to hear Your message. Although You are not understandable by the material senses, simply by hearing about You one can gradually conquer the nescience of misunderstanding. By Your grace only, You become revealed to the devotee. You are unconquerable by any other means. Speculative knowledge without any trace of devotional service is simply useless waste of time in search for You. Devotional service is so important that even a little attempt can raise one to the highest perfectional platform. One should not therefore neglect this auspicious process of devotional service and take to the speculative method. By the speculative method, one may gain partial knowledge of Your cosmic manifestation, but it is not possible to understand You, the origin of everything. The attempt of persons who are interested only in speculative knowledge is simply wasted labor, like the labor of a person who attempts to gain something by beating the empty husk of rice paddy. A little quantity of paddy can be husked by the grinding wheel, and one can gain some grains of rice, but if the skin, the paddy, is already beaten by the grinding wheel, there is no further gain in beating the husk. It is simply useless labor."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> school does not very much appreciate the speculative method. They surrender and they try to get knowledge directly from the Supreme Lord, as <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is being spoken by the Supreme Lord, or statements of the pure highly elevated devotees, just like Brahmā is speaking. This way. Hearing. The main purpose is hearing, hearing from the right source. That is... Especially in the western world, instead of hearing from the right source, they want to speculate about the Absolute. We have got about twenty books like this, but they are not speculation. They are simply by hearing. I am writing what I have heard, not that I am speculating. Mostly, the philosophers, they write as they speculate. They write their own opinion. But our process is not that. We don't speculate. We present the statements of God and His devotees. There is the whole book. Anywhere you won't find, "I think," "In my opinion," "Perhaps it should be like this way." No. We don't do that. As soon as there is "perhaps" or "maybe," that is not perfect knowledge. That is speculation. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Padma-Purāṇa,</span> there is statement of different species of life, <span class="Italic">jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi,</span> statement that "There are 900,000 species of life in the water." It is not written like this, "Perhaps," "it may be." No. Neither says one million or 800,000. No. 900,000 specifically. So how do they get this knowledge, exactly seeing? <span class="Italic">Jalajā nava-lakṣāṇi sthāvarā lakṣa-viṁśati</span> (?). Now, in another place, the magnitude of the soul is explained. <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> also it is stated that 10,000th part of the top of the hair point, is the magnitude of the soul. Our knowledge is accepted in that way, Vedic knowledge. Whatever is stated in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that is taken as Absolute Truth and we accept it. And that is fact. If you go to the same point by experimental truth, you will come to the same conclusion. So we think that by experimental knowledge, why should we waste our time? Better take the truth which is already stated in the Vedic literature and build up your farther premises on that basic principle. Just like that small fragment of spirit, 1/10,000th portion of the top of the hair, is there within you, within me, and that is rotating through the air, <span class="Italic">prāṇa, apāna, vyāna,</span> like that, the <span class="Italic">vāyu.</span> The yogic process is to capture it. But that is a fact, that the spirit soul is there within this body. It is a fact. So either you try to understand or capture it by the yogic process or you know it, that there is the soul within the body, the result is the same. Therefore you will find in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> at the end of the Sixth Chapter that the <span class="Italic">bhakta-yogī</span> is the topmost yogi.</div>
<div class="Verse">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-gatenāntarātmanā<br class="calibre2"/>śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa me yuktatamo mataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.47]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So naturally, Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> If one continues in this attitude, always to be absorbed in Kṛṣṇa... And Kṛṣṇa recommends, "Such person is the topmost yogi."</div>
<div class="Verse">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-gatenāntarātmanā<br class="calibre2"/>śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa me yuktatamo mataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.47]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So it is confirmed by the greatest authority, and if we practice... This practice can be done in the association of devotees. And that is perfection of life. There are some conditions about self-control: no meat-eating, no fish, no eggs, no illicit sex life, and no intoxication, even smoking, drinking tea, and no gambling. And chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and thinking of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Very easy. And everyone can perform it without undergoing the bodily exercises, which is sometimes difficult for a common man. So one can adopt this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process and become perfect. And this is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ tyajaty ante kalevaram [Bg. </span>8.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one becomes accustomed to this habit and at the time of death, he thinks of Kṛṣṇa, then his life is perfect. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Nitāi:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran bhāvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tyajaty ante kalevaram<br class="calibre2"/>taṁ tam evaiti kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>8.6]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sadā tad-bhāva-bhāvitaḥ.</span> Yes, this is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> "Whatever state of being one remembers when he quits this body, that state he will attain without fail."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are practicing this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> and teaching others also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> And when people are not prepared, for example, to be vegetarian and to..., when his mind is not prepared to his life what are you doing? How can you educate people to come...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are educating. We are educating hundreds and thousands. If one agrees to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Occidental people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all occidental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> Yes, yes, you, but very few people. How do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Occidental means eastern, er, western? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Western.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are all western. They have taken to it. They have given up all such habits. In the beginning they were coming to me with their girlfriends, boyfriends. I said, "No, you cannot stay like that." So they agreed. I have got them married personally. They have got children. If you want to live as <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> live. If you want to live as <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> or as <span class="Italic">sannyāsa...</span> So generally, young men, young girls, I get them married. There is no harm. Married life, sex life, that is allowed in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> But not illicit sex. That is not allowed. If one remains sinful, he cannot make any progress of spiritual life. That is not possible. This is bogus, that you remain sinful and at the same time make spiritual progress. That is not possible. Otherwise, why there is distinction of sinful and pious life? You must be pious life. And the basic principle of pious life is this, avoid these four sinful life: illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and meat-eating. They are sinful life. So one cannot make any progress in spiritual life who is habituated to act sinfully. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">M. Roost:</span> I am according, but how to understand, how to measure...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is plain understanding. Just like physician says that "If you eat these things, then you will not be cured." A physician should straightly speak to the patient, "You should not do this. Then you will be cured." If he does not agree, then he will not be cured. It is like that. If you remain sinful, then you cannot make any spiritual progress of life. That is going on. All the swamis, yogis, and... Don't mind. I have seen. They keep them in the sinful life and talk very, very, big, big words. That will not help. Sinful life must be stopped. Then yoga practice will be successful. <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihārasya yogo bhavati siddhiḥ.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If you are yogi, if you want <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> then you must eat and sleep and accept things<span class="Italic">-yukta.</span> <span class="Italic">Yukta</span> means "as it is required, not more than that, not less than that." That is <span class="Italic">yukta.</span> We don't say that you stop. No, we don't say. We give them eatables. We don't say there is no sex life. Sex life is there. But married, simply for begetting children. Otherwise, no sex life. Not for sense gratification. If these things go on... In New York there is a yogi. I do not wish to name his... But in the paper it was published that he was having sex with his disciple. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone knows. What is this? (laughing) Even from moral point of view, a disciple is just like daughter. And this man was having sex life with his disciple. And he's a yogi. Just see. Even he has no moral sense, apart from spiritual knowledge.
