<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...kinds of ideas and that we have ideas that can be very useful for them. So actually there is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you have to understand what is the basic principle of civilization, what we want to fulfill, what is the goal. There are different species of life beginning from aquatics, fishes and animals in the water. Then, as the water dries up, then vegetation come. In this way there is evolution from aquatics to vegetable life, then moving, insects, reptiles. Then, gradually, birds. From insect, the flies come out, and then flies gradually comes to bird. Then from birds to beast, four-legged. Then from beast to human being. Then human being, the aborigines, uncivilized. Then you come to civilized life, which is generally known as Aryan life. So the Aryan civilization, Vedic civilization... In this way we get this human form of life, developed consciousness. Now we should try to understand, "What I am? Am I this body or something else?" That is the subject matter of enquiry. So where is that department of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Where do we fit in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> We, the organization that I work for, the government that I work for, is, of course, very, very different, no doubt, in ideas and in philosophies to all of you, and you for example. We work within, however, a situation where we are concerned that within the framework of Australia's society, which involves people, private enterprise, industry, increasing population, all of these placing demands on what naturally is Australia, what you were talking about to begin with. The evolution of Australia, the continent, the land mass, and the birds, the animals. Of course, we have a magnificent and unique and diverse fauna and flora.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> These we must try to protect and preserve for two reasons. Our ideas are that we must, we have to be, to an extent, slaves to the twentieth-century civilization, or what we call the nowhere civilization. In other words, our function stops or is frustrated if a government won't give us money to continue our work and our research. So in other words, we have to direct a large part of our research towards people and making life and opportunities better for people. We can't, however, do that-we can't improve agricultural production, we can't improve forests, we can't improve recreational opportunities in the forest lands around cities-if we don't consider sympathetically, thoughtfully, and scientifically the natural resources of Australia. So it's interesting that you mentioned to begin with in the evolution, say of the evolutionary cycle in Australia, you mentioned the aborigines. The aborigines were in fact far better at maintaining and conserving the central Australian landscapes, the central Australian arid regions, than any Australian since European colonization.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The aborigines lived in almost perfect harmony with their environment for thirty thousand years, thirty to forty thousand recorded years-that's how far our research can take us back-whereas in a little over a hundred years, European man in Australia has done in places irreparable damage to not only the vegetation but also the soils of arid Australia. It's damage that will probably never, ever be repaired because the environment is so delicate in central Australia that as soon as our cloven-footed animals, our sheep and our cattle, for example, are brought into the arid areas, they eat, they trample, they remove vegetation. This loosens the soil; the soil is very thin. It's very unfertile, and it blows away. And virtually all you have left is rock. And nothing grows, of course, on rock. That's an over-simplification and perhaps an over-dramatization, but this has happened in Australia. It didn't happen when the aborigines lived here, undisturbed by us. It has happened since European man has come.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In Perth, in this city, around this city, since Europeans have come, we have removed forests, we've cut down trees, we've tilled the soil, we have changed the natural order of things, we have increased the amount of water from rain that flows through the soil. It's getting more and more salty. We are affecting our coastal wetlands, as we call them, the lagoons and the lakes and the marshes, so that they are becoming both more salty and more clogged with silt and soil and debris. Water birds can, in some areas, no longer live there. Fish are dying. A lot of migratory fish and crabs, for example, are no longer migrating to their traditional breeding grounds. So our work, our approach, is-and I have to stress that it is scientific and therefore it's long-term, and we're really a very young group here in western Australia-but our approach is to attempt first to understand what has happened, to understand what is happening, and then slowly to be able to suggest ways of improving or halting what is happening which is bad and putting forward ideas for what might happen which is good, which is good both for people...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">We're stuck with that, we're stuck with our urban... Whether we like it or not, we're stuck with our urban civilization. We're stuck with our Western way of doing things, unfortunately. But, that being the case, we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did the aborigines...? They were growing their food, the aborigines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Oh, no, no, no, no. The aborigines grew nothing really. They were nomadic. They were mostly meat-eaters and insect-eaters. There are... For example, one of the staples of the aborigines was a very thick and very fat grub called a witchity grub, which lived in the roots of certain low bushes, and they used to tear the bush over and these fat grubs would appear which would be eaten live and raw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No cooking. No cooking. Immediately, wiggling. The fresher the better. They used to eat small furry animals, bandicoots, wombats. There were no rabbits, of course, in those days. Rabbit has been a disaster introduced by man, by European man. But they used to occasionally pound the grass seeds from a few species of arid sand grasses and make a kind of an unleavened bread, which they would then bake. But generally the aborigines were nomadic, they were shifting, and they didn't cultivate. They didn't till the soil ever. But we must, whilst attempting to provide for the inevitable Australian people and the growth of population, we must also try to do that within the confines and the dictates of nature and the natural resources which we have. Australia is very rich in a lot of natural resources; it's very, very poor in others. It is quite poor in water, and, of course, water is absolutely basic to the growth process. Australia has abundant sunlight, solar energy, which is the basis of photosynthesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vegetable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> And vegetable growth. But we lack water. And in Perth we are doing an excellent job at ruining our water. It's criminal in many respects, what is going on. And this is what we must do. So we are trying to strike a balance between science for and research for the benefit of people. But it must be also for the benefit of the environment, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni. Annād.</span> A-n-n-a-d. <span class="Italic">Annād.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> A-n-n-a-d. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">annād bhavanti bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yajñād bhavati parjanyo<br class="calibre2"/>yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "All living bodies subsist on food grains, which are produced from rains. Rains are produced by the performance of <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> sacrifice, and <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is born of prescribed duties."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Purport: "Śrīla Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, a great commentator on the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> writes as follows: <span class="Italic">ye indrādy-aṅgatayāvasthitaṁ yajñaṁ sarveśvaraṁ viṣṇum abhyarcya tac-cheṣam aśnanti tena tad deha-yātrāṁ sampādayanti, te santaḥ sarveśvarasya bhaktāḥ sarva-kilbiṣair anādi-kāla-vivṛddhair ātmānubhava-pratibandhakair nikhilaiḥ pāpair vimucyante(?).</span> The Supreme Lord, who is known as the <span class="Italic">yajña-puruṣaḥ,</span> or the personal beneficiary of all sacrifices, is the master of all demigods who serve Him as the different limbs of the body serve the whole. Demigods like Indra, Candra, Varuṇa, etc., are appointed officers who manage material affairs, and the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> direct sacrifices to satisfy these demigods so that they may be pleased to supply air, light and water sufficiently to produce food grains. When Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshiped, the demigods, who are different limbs of the Lord, are also automatically worshiped; therefore there is no separate need to worship the demigods.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">For this reason, the devotees of the Lord, who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, offer food to Kṛṣṇa and then eat-a process which nourishes the body spiritually. By such action not only are past sinful reactions in the body vanquished, but the body becomes immunized to all contamination of material nature. When there is an epidemic disease, an antiseptic vaccine protects a person from the attack of such an epidemic. Similarly, food offered to Lord Viṣṇu and then taken by us makes us sufficiently resistant to material affection, and one who is accustomed to this practice is called a devotee of the Lord. Therefore, a person in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who eats only food offered to Kṛṣṇa, can counteract all reactions of past material infections, which are impediments to the progress of self-realization. On the other hand, one who does not do so continues to increase the volume of sinful action, and this prepares the next body to resemble hogs and dogs, to suffer the resultant reactions of all sins.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The material world is full of contamination, and one who is immunized by accepting <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> of the Lord, food offered to Viṣṇu, is saved from the attack, whereas one who does not do so becomes subjected to contamination. Food grains or vegetables are factually eatables. The human being eats different kinds of food grains, vegetables, fruits, etc., and the animals eat the refuse of the food grains and vegetables, grass, plants, etc. Human beings who are accustomed to eating meat and flesh must also depend on the production of vegetation in order to eat the animals. Therefore, ultimately, we have to depend on the production of the field and not on the production of big factories. The field production is due to sufficient rain from the sky, and such rains are controlled by demigods like Indra, sun, moon, etc., and they are all servants of the Lord. The Lord can be satisfied by sacrifices; therefore, one who cannot perform them will find himself in scarcity-that is the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Yajña,</span> specifically the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> prescribed for this age, must be therefore performed to save us at least from scarcity of food supply."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did you follow? So the only remedy is that you should perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> And this <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is, in this age, <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> performance of <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> is very costly affair. At the present moment, things are not available. So you should perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> If you don't perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then nature will restrict supply and put so many impediments. That <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ... [Bg. </span>3.14]. If you regularly perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> then there will be sufficient rainfall. There is sufficient water. Just like all around there is water. There is no scarcity of water. But you cannot touch it without God's intervention. The same water will be converted into cloud and will be distributed on the land, and the water again glide down to the reservoir of water. This is nature's way. But if you do not perform <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> this machine will not work to get water from the sea, convert into cloud, and then distribute. This will be restricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But we must all perform <span class="Italic">yajña</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you have to perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> And that <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> at the present moment, is very easy, to... <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtanaiḥ yajñaiḥ.</span> It is recommended that we have to recognize the authority of the Lord, and in this age, simply by performing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> He will be satisfied. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> means to glorify the Lord in so many ways. We glorify the Lord His form, His activities, His name, His quality. So it is not difficult job. We can sit together, family-wise, community-wise, or in office, in factory. We can sit down together and glorify the Lord. Is it very difficult job?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> You make it sound very, very simple of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then why don't you accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well, I for one might. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I am not talking about you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No, no, sure, certainly, but imagine the man, as we have to consider, the men, the thousands of them on their tractors, at their bulldozers, hacking down natural forest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He says we have to consider the men who are working the machines to take down the forest for agriculture... Is that what you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> The point I'm making is that there are so many people in Australia who would have no time. They are too busy making money. They are too busy doing what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what you will do with money? If there is no grain, then will you eat money? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Certainly not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That is foolishness. Money is not required. Required-food grains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But unfortunately, of course increasingly now, in our society, there is an increasing ability to produce food almost artificially. And this happens more and more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the scarcity? Why you are complaining, "There is scarcity of water." Why? You are complaining, "scarcity." If there is enough food, then why you are complaining about scarcity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well, I complain because I am a geographer, because I am working with an eye to the future, with an eye to a long-term situation where I can see that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I... Your problem and my problem is not different. You are thinking... I am not thinking. It may be. But you require food grain, I require food grain, the animals require food grain, and everyone requires food grain. So if there is sufficient food grain, then everyone will be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Yes, now perhaps. How about in fifty years' time though?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> How about in fifty or a hundred years' time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you were complaining about scarcity of water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Yes, sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gradually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But also... sorry, I don't mean-and perhaps I didn't explain myself well enough. I do not mean to address myself only to a problem which is here with us right now. Perth, for example, right now this city does not have a scarcity. There's plenty of water around. Seventy percent in fact of the water which is delivered to domestic homes every summer is put on gardens to make them green. It's not used for growing vegetables. It's not used for human consumption or human existence, for supporting human life. It's used for making lawns such as outside this house, making lawns and trees green so that houses will be attractive and the property values will go up. Once again it's the money ethic. It's the money situation. It's what our society exists on. It's what makes it all go around. But what I am worried about is the situation in a hundred years' time. There isn't a scarcity now, although the water is getting, is becoming less and less acceptable, where, by taking down the forests, we're letting more water seep into the soil, it's unlocking the salt that's been in the soil for thousands of years, and so on.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That's our problem. It's long term and it's complex. I'm worried about generations to come, not now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. If there is rainfall sufficiently, that water is distilled water, pure water. So if pure water is distributed all over the country...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> It's pure when it hits the ground, but it isn't, unfortunately, when it comes out into the streams.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says it's pure when the rain comes down, but when it hits the ground it becomes impure and then the salt gets in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. It is not... Rain water is pure water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when it touches the ground, it may become impure. It doesn't water (matter). But the water is pure. Water is coming. You cannot take water from the sea and moisten the ground with... That is not possible. But if pure water comes down from the rain, it is utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But a lot of the water that is in our dams and the water that we use for irrigation south of here, which is the basis for the dairy produce of Perth, is becoming slowly, because of its contact with the ground and its travel through the soil and its seepage out into streams and into underground areas, that water is slowly becoming in many respects almost as salty as the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But first of all, you want water. If the water is reserved on the top of the hill, then it gradually comes down. That is nature's, God's, arrangement: Let river fall down, and you can use that water. That is the nature's arrangement. Just like you keep your water on the tank, and by pipe you get down. But there is nature's arrangement. The water is stocked on the top of the hill, and throughout the whole year the pipe is the river. That water must be there. That is the first problem. Therefore here it is said, <span class="Italic">parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> You must have sufficient water. Water is already there. But it has to be purified, kept on the top of the hill, water tank, and it will come down in rivers. Then you take and utilize. And when the water falls down and there is sufficient water, the ground becomes cleansed so it is no more polluted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> It's a very complex thing. In the hills outside Perth there are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is the general plan that you must have sufficient water. And that water must fall down from the cloud, not by your system you pump out water from the sea and utilize. That is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No, sure, we can't do that. We can't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore you must have pure water. And that water is manufactured or supplied through God's machine, not your machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Certainly not. And I wouldn't presume to suggest in any way that that was the case. What our problem is, though, is that because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that problem solved if you perform sacrifice. That is the verse. <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> And <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyo yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Very simple formula. If we follow this formula, that first of all, if we want regular water supply... That we want. Not that "if we want." We must have regular water supply. So that is possible by performing <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Um hm, um hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajña</span> means to satisfy the Supreme Lord. That is <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ. Karma</span> means your activities. Whatever you are doing, that is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> You are working as geologist? What is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Geographer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Geographer. And another man is working in the factory or somewhere else. Everyone is working. So by working the aim should be how to perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> That is... That should the... Suppose you are geographer, and I am a religious preacher, and he is a cultivator, he is a factory man, he is a motorcar driver. So that is all right. But if we sit down together and perform <span class="Italic">yajña</span> simply by glorifying the Lord, where is the loss in your part or my part or his part? Where is the loss? Suppose as a geographer, you sit down; as a religious preacher, I sit down; as a motorcar driver, he sits down; as a factory worker, he sits down and perform <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajña</span> means we chant the holy name of the Lord. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> I wish it were as simple as that for the majority of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone. Even the child can take part. Even the child, woman, educated, noneducated, rich man, poor man, worker-everyone can sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So why don't you accept this formula?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> How do you know that I haven't?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But how about the people living next door or the people...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can form different groups. You can form your group. Suppose there is hundred gentlemen in this neighborhood. We can sit down. If he has no time, they can sit down with family members. Everyone has got family. Everyone has got his wife, children or somebody else, servant. Sit down for half an hour and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No difficulty at all. But it doesn't happen, does it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to introduce. That is our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Sure, yes, I can see that. But why aren't people doing it? Why aren't more people? In Perth, in this city, why aren't more doing it? I'll tell you one reason. And it is because Austra...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people should be educated that "If you do not perform this <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> you will suffer."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But, of course, there are conflicting educations, aren't there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they may be. What is the wrong there, that, if we sit down together and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> without any loss of our factory or work? But if there is some gain, why not try it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> A delightful idea, a beautiful idea, and a very simple-sounding idea. How about, however, the Anglicans, the Roman Catholics, who are bound in this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the... No, Roman Catholics... We don't say that Roman Catholics cannot perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> We say that you chant the holy name of God. So Roman Catholics they have God or not, no God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well, they think they do a lot of that on a Sunday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, whatever it may be, any religious system... Religious system means connection with God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Yeah, well, that's what it's supposed to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without God, is there any religion? Any religion, is there any religion who will say, "No, we have no God." Is there any religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are asking, "Chant the holy name of God." So if you are Roman Catholic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Any man's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any man's God. God is one. God cannot be two. But we are thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Roman Catholics don't agree with you on that, do they? Roman Catholics have their own God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> And this is one of the problems. It's nowhere near as simple as, I am sure, as you suggest, and I wish it were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is simple. It is simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> The Roman Catholics are a jealous people. Roman Catholics are jealous religious people. They refuse even still to accept, for example, that Anglicans pray in the same way as they do. They refuse to accept that Anglicans pray as well as they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, one thing is that may be Anglican, may be Roman Catholics, may be Christian, may be Hindu or Muslim or anyone. Whether they have God in their conception of religion or not. Do they have God or no God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well they all have. They must have, to be a religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am asking that "You chant the holy name of God. If you have God, you chant the holy name of that God." I don't say that "You chant the holy name of my God." You chant the holy name of your God. God is one. Just like water. Somebody says "water," somebody says "<span class="Italic">pāni,</span>" somebody says "<span class="Italic">jala,</span>" but the end is, the aim is, water. Similarly, God... I may say "Kṛṣṇa," you may say "Jehovah," the Muslims may say "Allah," or others may say something else, but the aim is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well, why aren't we better off then? Because obviously, therefore, going on what you've just said, there are a lot of people in Australia every day, perhaps certainly once every week, chanting the name of their God. Why then do we still have problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, problem...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Are there not enough people chanting to their God or to the one God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So problems... Suppose if you are... Aborigines, they have God? They have their name of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Yes, well, they have multiple gods, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if they chant the holy name of God there is no loss. At least there is no loss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No, certainly, oh, well, we've established that, sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not begin this? There is no loss. You are not losing anything. Suppose if you chant the holy name of God as a geographer. Your salary is not decreased. So there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Certainly not, no. But why is there...? If people are, in their own way, then, chanting to their God, why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no... Ultimately, you require sufficient supply of water to grow your food, vegetables. Or even if you are animal-eater, to maintain your animals you require sufficient water. And that is recommended, that <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And the <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is very simple: chanting the holy name of the Lord. So why not introduce, that every home, every factory, every community, every place, they should sit down at least for half an hour and chant the holy name of the Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Could I ask you very simply? You suggest this. If we all do this, will that, for example, remove the problems that we do, that our society, at any rate, at any guess, generates for ourself? We have more and more pollution. Depending on the way the wind blows, for example, we get at times choking pollution from the industrial complexes down to the south of this city. Are these problems going to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the next question will be, "If you get sufficient grain for eating, why should you take to industry?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> To make money, very simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what for, money? Money means you require the necessities of life. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But that's not what the multinational corporations that enjoy using Australia's resources are going to say. All of the hills to the east of Perth are almost entirely made up of bauxite, from which of course, we get, not that, the stainless steel, but from which we get aluminium. Aluminium is a very... Bauxite is a very, very favored material now. The West Indies are rich in it, and a few other countries, but not many. Australia is now part of, as they call it, part of "the bauxite club." And Dr. Cairns(?), our deputy prime minister and treasurer, was some months ago talking with a number of people in the West Indies about fixing world prices for bauxite and eventually aluminium. America has Comalco and Alcoa, two very large international groups, have large interests in the bauxite in the hills around Perth. They are out to make money. They're in it to return money to their shareholders in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But therefore, there are two ways of living. One way of living is called material enjoyment, or sense enjoyment. This is one way of life. In Sanskrit it is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti-mārga,</span> "How to enjoy more, more, more, more, more." This is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti-mārga.</span> That is going on. The whole... At the present moment the whole civilization, throughout the whole world-everyone is trying to get more money. More money means more sense enjoyment. More money means more sense enjoyment. This is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti-mārga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Well, maybe less enjoyment but more possessions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, enjoyment in this way of life more sense enjoyment, you will never be able to enjoy or happiness. That is not possible. That is the nature's way. (Aside:) You can close the door. If you simply want to enjoy, you can enjoy. But you will create more miseries. So this is one way of life, that you enjoy your senses and create more miseries. This is one way of life. And if you want to decrease your miseries, then there is another life, which is called simple life. Simple life means you produce your food and you produce your cloth so you dress yourself nicely, you eat, yourself, nicely, keep yourself fit and glorify the Lord. This is one way of life. And the other way of life, that "We don't care for the Lord. Let us enjoy the senses to the topmost capacity and be happy..." So this way of life will never make you happy. You will simply go on struggling. This is one way of life. Another way of life, that the human life is meant for God realization...</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That is Vedānta philosophy. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Now, by evolutionary process, we have come to the human form of life, and it is meant for asking, "What is my constitutional position? Am I this body, or I am something else?" The dogs, he cannot put this inquiry. A dog, he thinks that he is dog, that's all. He is jumping, he is barking, and eating, sleeping, and having sex. That's all. If I ask one dog, "Please sit down. Hear <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>" it is not possible. But you are human being, if I ask you, "Mr. such and such, sit down, hear from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>" you can do that. First of all we must know the difference between dog and me. The dog is incapable to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But human being... Just like we are selling this book in the Western countries, many millions of copies, because they are human being. We are not selling among the cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Hm, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if a human being does not become inquisitive to understand what he is, in which way his progress should me made, then he remains a dog. The dog cannot do it. And we have got the capacity. If we neglect this facility and remain like a dog, simply engaged in eating, sleeping, sex, and defense, then we remain dog. Then again we become dog. The opportunity was given to us to understand the problems of life, how to solve. If you don't take this opportunity, facility, if you simply remain like dog, then we are next life... That also they do not understand, that there is next life. Do you believe in the next life? You, a person, do you believe in a next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No, I don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> So therefore I'm bad material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But I will become an old man anyway in the course of my life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore there is future life. If you say, "I don't believe in it,"...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Are you talking about reincarnation, life after death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Reincarnation, you are already reincarnated. Where is your that childhood body? Where is that body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Here it is. It's grown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, it is changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> It's grown, it's changed, it's evolved, I have evolved. Just like evolution, I have evolved to the situations...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway... Just try to understand. Anyway, that, your boy's body or childhood body is no longer. Either you say changed or grown, whatever you say, it doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But they're the same bones, it's the same skin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are the same man. That's a fact. You understand that you were a child or you were a boy, youthful boy, jumping. You remember that body, but that body is not existing. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> I can't agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why not? Suppose somebody had seen your childhood body, and for many years he has not seen you, and he all of a sudden comes. Suppose your father's friend. So father introduces. He says, "Oh, you are the same?" He will be surprised because he saw you in a childhood body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But I'm less interested in what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all think that you have changed your body. The other man says, "Oh, you have grown up?" Or... Generally they take it as grown up. But the actual position is the body has changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But they're the same bones. It's the same skin. My face looks just about the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not it is same. Medically, it is not the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> The functions are different, but it's the same heart that's beating, the same veins...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, it is not the same body. Just like in your childhood, when you were a boy, you had no sex impulse. Now you have got sex impulse. The body of a child, the body of a boy, they cannot understand sex life because the body is different. And now, because you have got different body, you can feel what is sex life. So it is imperceptibly changing. Therefore we think that it is growing. But it is changing. It is changing swiftly. Just like in the cinema spool. The picture is changing, but because it is changing so swiftly, you are seeing that one man is moving. That is the fact. There are hundreds and thousands of pictures passed on. When you see that "This man is taking the stick and bringing this way," this means there are many pictures. So similarly, it is like a spool. Your body is changing every moment. That is medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Absolutely. Yes. At every moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So changing. So you are changing your body. That's a fact. But because you are seeing all in one spool, you are thinking, "It is growing; it is moving." That's all. But it is changing. This is the science. So body is changing. And you remember that you had such-and-such body. Therefore you are different from the body. This is the science. So unless we understand that "I am not this body. I am different from the body. I am changing bodies. Therefore I will have to change this body and accept another body..." This is the science, beginning of scientific knowledge. Without understanding this fact his advancement of knowledge is simply for eating, sleeping, sex, and defense. That's all. There is no advancement. According to Vedic literature, he remains animal. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The simple truth. But people have no education. That is the defect of the modern civilization. This is the fact, that you are accepting every moment a different body. So after death, you will have to accept another body. Now, we should know, "What kind of body I am going to accept next?" That is intelligence. That is civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Do you mean that the, that that, then, will allow me, if I come to that realization, that that will allow me to then continue to improve my mind, continue to study, to think, to gain knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> ...beyond say the normal sixty-five or seventy years that I might live in what I imagine to be this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The knowledge should be acquired from the beginning of life, from childhood. But if by circumstances I could not get this knowledge from childhood, then we should begin immediately. Because unless we get this knowledge, our life remains imperfect. We remain animal. The animal does not know this. And after evolutionary process, coming to the human form of body, if we keep ourself in the darkness of animal life, then our this opportunity is lost. This is the first problem. Unfortunately, the modern education is... Leaders, they have no education, and they are thinking just like animal that "I am this body." Therefore you are thinking you are Australian, I am thinking I am Indian, he is thinking American, he..., only on this bodily concept of life. But we are not this body. We are different from this body. So unless we understand this point, our aim of life, our standard of civilization, is incorrect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> I suppose it's very easy to understand and to credit that so many people will be thinking maybe this way because that's part of the basis of being selfish, and, after all, a lot of people, particularly, I would imagine, a lot of Australians, are basically selfish. They are interested far more in what they can get and do for themselves not necessarily by working hard, by striving or by reading or by thinking or by studying. They, they... The old saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The human life is meant for acquiring knowledge, real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But so many people don't see it that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least one class of men must be thoroughly conversant, thoroughly aware of the things as they are. They are called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Therefore the society should be divided into four classes. The first-class men, who have got full knowledge of life and the problems of life... That there should be, the first-class men. They may be very few; it doesn't matter. Ideal class. People will learn by their behavior, by their character, by their knowledge. So must be there. Then the next class would be the administrators. They would be advised by the first-class men, and they would administer the state. And the third-class men, they should produce food, enough food for the whole population. And the fourth-class men would assist these three higher class, first class, second class and third class. This is the arrangement, nature's arrangement. There are first-class men; there are second-class men; there are third-class men; there are fourth-class men. But if you produce simply fourth-class men, there cannot be any adjustment.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">It will be chaotic society. That is the present position, that there is no first-class men, there is no second-class men. There may be some third-class men, and all fourth-class men. This is the position. Therefore the whole human society is in chaotic condition. The first-class man should understand this. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is the meaning of <span class="Italic">dhīra</span>? Just see.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All are necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> ...for the removal... Yes, sure. But you're saying that we don't have the first class of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you create.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But... But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By education you create.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Fine. But how... O.K. How about, then the, some of the ancient and maybe even now the latter-day philosophers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> ...the men of sobriety and gentleness, the Bertrand Russells for example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have to be trained. Just like you have been trained up as geographer; similarly, a certain man can be trained up as first-class man by education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But trained by others or trained by themselves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there must be institution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But surely training by oneself. But training by oneself, such as for example an Albert Einstein or a Bertrand Russell...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, no, no, no. By teacher. You have become geographer not by yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Oh, yes, but we also have many... I'm nowhere near what you're saying is a first-class. I'm talking about some of our latter-day philosophers, and Bertrand Russell is a person, for example, who, for gentleness, sobriety, and thought, whom I admire very much. And he has attained that himself. He hasn't been... He was certainly, as we all must be, surely, trained to begin with. But then it's a process of individual thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. No, no, no. But that's all right. Just like we have got different institution-this is for educating engineers, this is for educating medical man, this is for educating geographer-as there are different departments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Oh, sure, to begin with, and so there must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, there must be a department to train first-class men. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> We don't have them in our universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore it is chaotic, no first-class men, all third class, fourth class.</div>

And every religion teaches that. Now take in your Christian religion. Christ said, "Thou shall not kill." And they are maintaining slaughterhouse. So this is the condition of the society. How you can become happy? You are violating the rules and regulation of religion and God. You cannot become... Nature will disturb in so many ways. That is nature's business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> But so many of us, of course, are used to it. We like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not talking about you particularly, but general way, general way. So this is first-class man. <span class="Italic">Śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣā.</span> Now, suppose I was not a first-class man; I was a fourth-class man. Now I want to become a first-class man. So I was eating meat. Just these boys, European, American boys, they were eating everything. Now they have given up. On my word or to associate with me, they have given up meat-eating, illicit sex, meat-eating. So in the beginning it may be disturbing because "I am habituated to all these things, and by my spiritual master order not to do this..." So it may be disturbing. But that is called <span class="Italic">titikṣā,</span> tolerance: "No, I have to do it. If I want to make progress to become first-class man, this is order, so I must do it even..." The tolerance. Even it is disturbing... In the beginning. It is not disturbing. In the beginning, because I habituated to do something... Just like a thief. If you ask him to become honest, it will be disturbing for him because he is habituated to steal.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So that we have to tolerate. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">titikṣā. Śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣā ārjavam. Ārjavam</span> means simple life, simplicity, that "If I can live in this way, why shall I acquire so many things for artificial life?" That is called <span class="Italic">ārjavam. Śamaḥ damaḥ titikṣā ārjavam,</span> then <span class="Italic">jñānam. Jñānam</span> means knowledge that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul. My..." Actually that is the fact. This body is not important. The living force within the body is important. As soon as the living force goes out of the body, what is this value? You may be a great geographer or scientist or Professor Einstein or whatever. As soon as the living force is gone, you are useless, this body is useless. You have to throw it. That is <span class="Italic">jñānam,</span> that "I am taking so much care of this material body, which will not exist, which I shall, become... 'Dust thou art; dust thou beist.' Again it will mix up with these dirty things. I am taking so much care of this body. What about that living force, which is important?"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Nobody is taking care. Therefore they are not in <span class="Italic">jñānam,</span> knowledge. They are in ignorance just like cats and dogs. This is called <span class="Italic">jñānam.</span> And the <span class="Italic">vijñānam. Vijñānam</span> means practical application of the knowledge. That is called <span class="Italic">vijñānam,</span> science. Scientific knowledge there is. <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam. Āstikyam</span> means to believe in the authority. That is called <span class="Italic">āstikyam.</span> Just like we are speaking about this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> because it is spoken by the most supreme authority, Kṛṣṇa. To believe in the authority. You also believe in authority. But ultimately, in this way, if we acquire this qualification, then we become first-class man. So anyone can be trained up. Just like these boys. They were fourth class, fifth class. And now they are trained up to become first-class men. Just like anyone can become geographer, anyone can become engineer by proper training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Do you think you'll make it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I'm making progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are young men. They are all within thirty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> And your aim, all of you, is to become first-class men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Does it matter how long it might take you? Can you become first-class men soon, within five years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, sufficient, sufficient. We can make in one year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Really. I wish you all well. Well, I hope I won't give you offense if I look at my watch and say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is a very important matter. If you do not spare time, that is your business, but... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> I'm afraid my life is one of these selfish lives. It's a life that's dominated by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is natural, just natural. Just like why first-class men required in society? Just like in your body there is first-class part, second-class part, third-class part, and fourth-class part. Just like your head is the first-class part of your body. If your head is cut off, then everything is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> True.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, if in the society, if we don't create first-class men, that society is dead. That society is dead. So at the present moment there is no first-class men according to this word. Therefore there is chaotic condition, problems, and so on, so on, so on. So unless you create at least a few percentage of the people first-class men according to this standard, there cannot be any progress. This is my last word to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Thank you. I wish you all well, and maybe I should think along those lines myself. It's been most interesting talking to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is necessary to create a class of men first class, ideal. And if you all create fourth-class men, then there cannot be peace. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Excellent talking to you. Thank you very much and I wish you well in Melbourne and then in Hawaii?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Fiji and Hawaii. You can keep his address. He may talk with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Here is a sweet we have made from milk product.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Justin Murphy:</span> Thank you. Good night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.<span class="Italic"> Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He said that... When we were walking to the car, he said... I was talking to him a little bit about it, and I gave him some magazines to read. He said it is very convincing argument about the, why the problems are all there because of the bodily concept of life. So he said, "It is a very convincing point of view and very thought-provoking." So I think he listened very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, if this kind of man will understand-they are in position-that will be a great... He is better than so many clergies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> (laughs) Yes. I invited someone for Friday. I can't guarantee that he'll come. But anyhow, his name is... He's from the local government Alcohol and Drug Authority. And they are... They have hospitals to treat people who are addicted to drugs and alcohol. He is a social worker who has worked in a mental hospital, and he wants to bring a psychologist and a psychiatric nurse. And I hope he comes because he sounded intelligent like that also. These people are looking... They have problems on their hands, and they don't know what to do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This world is full of problems. I have said. If you go this way, sense gratification, then you will have only problem. And if you go this way, towards God, there will be no problem. Because nature will put forward so many obstacles if you go. Because this is not the way of life, human life. Animal life, that is another thing. But they do not know. But human life, he is given the opportunity to go towards God, but he does not take this opportunity. He goes towards animal. Then there will be problem. Nature will not excuse. "So you are given the opportunity, and you are again becoming animal? You must suffer." This is nature's way. Therefore they are suffering problems. So many directors, so many government, the problem cannot be solved. That is nature's way. These foolish persons, they should know how nature is working. Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are thinking, "I am director," "I am minister," "I am this, I am..."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">What is...? You are all rascals. Nature is working differently. That they do not know. They do not believe in the nature's authority. They think, "We have become authority."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br class="calibre2"/>guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br class="calibre2"/>kartāham iti manyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.27]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Translation: "The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities, which are in actuality carried out by nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is pulled by the ear by the nature, "You rascal, you have associated with this quality. You do this. You must accept this body." That he does not know. "Now you have acted like dog, you accept this body of a dog." This is nature's creation. You cannot say, "No, no, no, I don't want this body." No, you must. "You acted like dog, you take this body of a dog." That he does not know. He is thinking, "I am all in all; I am independent." That is foolishness. The whole world, big, big scientists and philosophers, all in ignorance, and they are being pulled by the ear by nature. That they do not know. What is the purport I have given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Purport. "Two persons, one in Kṛṣṇa consciousness and the other in material consciousness, working on the same level, may appear to be working on the same platform, but there is a wide gulf of difference in their respective positions. The person in material consciousness is convinced by false ego that he is the doer of everything. He does not know that the mechanism of the body is produced by material nature, which works under the supervision of the Supreme Lord. The materialistic person has no knowledge that ultimately he is under the control of Kṛṣṇa. The person in false ego takes all credit for doing everything independently, and that is the symptom of his nescience. He does not know that this gross and subtle body is the creation of material nature, under the order of the Supreme Personality of Godhead,..." (end)</div>
