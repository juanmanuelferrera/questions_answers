<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa knows. He has imitated Kṛṣṇa's plan. Kṛṣṇa has made so many birds. So you cannot make any other size. That is the version of the Vedānta. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> The original idea is from Kṛṣṇa. You simply, you can imitate. That's all. Just like there are so many imitation birds. Similarly, everything is imitation. Everything is imitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. In <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavata</span> you get so many stories wherein all of <span class="Italic">devas</span> and <span class="Italic">kinnaras,</span> they come in their own planes and stand there with the planes. How could they stand with their planes down there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is much improved. This is not so much improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And in good old days when the planes were not in existence, the westerners thought that we were all fairy stories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are also thinking, "There is no Kṛṣṇa. There is no background." We are also thinking. (chuckles) Although we are big, big leaders, we are simply imitators of the westerners. That's all. Western people are our father and mother. That is our modern Indian... Now, western people are drinking wine. Now the government is drinking. Gandhi stopped it, but "No, the western people do." Unless they drink wine, they cannot be very... They work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Here they are all now alco...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So western people, western civilization has become the father and mother of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They idolize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they don't drink so much, I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> These boys in western...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are now introducing. Now, when it is introduced, they'll be accustomed. They'll drink day and night. Don't bother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have not got that experience. When I was a student in London, in London University, the boys there, they drink but not that much as they drink here. They are abusing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every, every few steps there is a wine shop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, every few steps, now you can have that in your own home. Here. You give the minister ten thousand rupees of bribes for a license to... [break] ...have in your home. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...these four things which we are prohibiting: illicit sex...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And drinking, meat-eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, intoxication, meat-eating and gambling. So these four things are encouraged by the government. Gambling, that, what is that? Lottery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Lottery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And meat-eating: beef shop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Masko(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The government has big distribution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And prostitution means contraceptive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Birth control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prostitution and illicit sex, contraceptive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who use the best, these contraceptives?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The boys and the girls in the colleges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See. They're encouraging, encouraging these things. So why they will like? Now,... Therefore our position is that they want to drive us. The whole plan is they do not want this Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement to stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can they drive you? I don't agree with you on that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they are trying their best. They wanted to break the temple and drive away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They, temple they broke...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But self-discipline alone is... nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the plan. And now no sanction of temple. That was the plea, that "It is temporary. It should be broken." And when we asked for permanent approval, "No sanction." This is clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Have you got the... Have you received the, renewed the temporary permit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, we've applied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every year we have to apply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, every year it should be applied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the law. I give this warning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the law of breaking temple. And when we want, that is the law, "No sanction." (Hindi) This is our position. If we go forward, then we are culprit. And if we remain backward, then we are culprit. Both ways. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now, camp of the sin of these people is now filling up, and Kalki-avatāra must come out. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...gentlemen. Otherwise, how they could reign for eight hundred years? At that time Hindus were very strong. They were rigid. And there were many native princes. Still, they ruled over India for eight hundred years. As soon as the Aurangzeb showed his bigotry, it was failed. Muslim... As they're advertised, Muslims are not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They were good to Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mākhanalāl:</span> They have very much reputation for violence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In Vṛndāvana we have got. So all the Muslim emperors, they contributed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that way, in Vṛndāvana you have got some signs that some of the Arabs have become saints, Hindu saints. Two or three Arabs, they have got very big tombs there in Vṛndāvana. Arab saints. They came to Surat and then they, I mean... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...our calculation is if the Muslims were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So bad as that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...so bad, then how they could rule for eight hundred years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is right, but they were bad enough. They were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bad enough... Your, our so called Hindus are worst enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's all right. But they were bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because devotees of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they were bad enough, we are now worst enough. We are now introducing meat-eating and drinking and... We are worst.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, in the newspaper the other day it said that the India government wants to start exporting beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Beef! Because they want to... Yes, we read it. They want to be..., slaughter the surplus cows because they are not yielding enough milk. There was very big article I read wherein they said that not only the milk is important, but the cow dung is as fertilizer in the fields much more than the modern day... [break] No? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, go-rakṣya?</span> Why not another animal<span class="Italic">-rakṣya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bāgha-rakṣya koro.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is specially mentioned? <span class="Italic">Go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are doing <span class="Italic">bāgha-rakṣya</span> here, not <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya.</span> All the tigers are getting much... [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhava-bhūti:</span> ...Balavanta's election campaign. After a fired-up speech by Balavanta, one lady called up and said "Why do you keep referring to the American people as animals?" So she was so offended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> She became violent. So all violent, they are animals. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are good.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If they do not take seriously to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then this prosperity will not exist.</div>
