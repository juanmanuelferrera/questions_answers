<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...demon came here to try and make Rāmeśvara leave with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tried to take him home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A big demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In order to kidnap?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, his father arranged it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> His father sent him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A very big demon. And Rāmeśvara preached to him, and what happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We made him very embarrassed by preaching to him, he felt very insignificant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rāmeśvara Mahārāja called him a jackass (laughter) and many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how he was trying to kidnap you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, and we tried to prove to him that he was afraid of death and we are not. We are better situated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda wants to know how did he actually try to kidnap you by telling you, or by his philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He was trying to convince me that the goal of life is sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. That is the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's one of our buses, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the bus that will take you to the farm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is already mentioned. Unless one understands that there is another life, sex life is the only pleasure. That will keep him perpetually conditioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He also tried to say that our movement will never be accepted, it is a waste of time. Why are we trying. We'll never be accepted by the public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why you have accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We said that, why have so many Americans now given up voluntarily, from wealthy families they have given up so many material things. But then he said "But you haven't given up material things. Just look at this building, just see how opulent, how can you claim you have given up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>So what do you mean by...? We shall live in the sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Flower in the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You shall live in the building and we shall live in the sky, in the air? You mean to say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We told him that this building is actually for rascals like you. To try to inspire you a little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were calling him directly rascal and fool. He was calling him a rascal directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We also showed him that our movement is being accepted, in different ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yesterday we spoke to Gurukṛpā and he's having, some of his men were deported.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> From where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So his collection is not going to be as..., he wanted to do two hundred thousand dollars this month but he says it won't be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why deported?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, because they are Hare Kṛṣṇas. There's one man, he says, in Osaka that's a big demon, one policeman who simply makes his business to try and find out the devotees. So that one man arrested three of them in one day. Anyway he's just taking another thirty-five thousand out and he's immediately transferring today ten thousand to Gargamuni and he's arranging a bank account jointly with Rāmeśvara in Los Angeles for his other money. Rāmeśvara will put the money in fixed deposit and monthly transfer ten thousand dollars for construction. Gurukṛpā was happy to know that the money could be used for that. He says he's studying, chanting and working very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are trying to drive us away. How to counteract it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we have to do some positive, very subtle positive preaching. I suggested that-if you recall-I suggested that a cultural center should be opened there on the basis of showing dolls, showing movies, restaurant,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But very vague.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's printing Japanese <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> this year he says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But very vague, not dressed as devotees, strictly cultural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Cultural. They should... Deity worship one of the items. Otherwise it is called <span class="Italic">bhāgavata</span> and <span class="Italic">pañcarātra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I felt that it should be done in a very modern American style but very cultural with Vedic subject matter. Then gradually they would appreciate it. As well as the library party. If the library party, Satsvarūpa is thinking to go all over the world now, if they go to Japan they are expecting a good reception in Japan, that will be another advantage if your books are accepted by the professors there. I thought that a cultural presentation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have to somehow or another get the local people to join there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well that's the way, see they're not going to join as Hare Kṛṣṇas because of the bad publicity. They're not going to join like that. You have to have a different method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this church, big church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gurudāsa also called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Lutheran Church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in Detroit. He told me to book his ticket to London on the same flight that you were going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I came here in the evening, with umbrella and in the morning I saw the whole street is white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> White-washed, you thought it was white-washed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> From the snow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa: :</span>He thought that someone had poured white wash.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I first saw from the window that the street was all white, "How is that? One white-washed?" (laughter) Then when I saw in the street, "Oh!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You never saw snow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even in the Himalayas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw in Kashmir, but that was not so white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> From a distance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, on the street also, but not so white. That is ice, not snow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yes. Here it's snow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Eighth Avenue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No this is Central Park West. I used to live on this street. I was living here, Eighty-first Street and Columbus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are apartment buildings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yes, all residential. Very big, actually they are very first-class residential apartments. The ceilings are very high in every one of them, fifteen, twenty-foot ceilings. Nowadays the ceilings are usually only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At most.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise nine feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The best ceilings I've seen is in Calcutta in our place in Calcutta, very high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta, all aristocratic buildings, they are made according to English pattern, London pattern. Just like our temple, it is made London pattern. It was designed by one high-court judge. (pause) The land acquisition at Māyāpura, no news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No news. [break] ...who are building the Ratha-yātrā carts and who help in the temple construction? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, this is so cold. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Unbearable [break] ...too cold then we can go in our bus to Florida for preaching. In the winter you go to Florida, eighty-five, ninety degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Florida. And in summer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Summer it's not very pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's about the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really? Most people though, most tourists don't go to Florida in the summer time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very hot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is a little hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some rain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's moisture in the air and rain, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have a lot of hurricanes there, don't they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> A few. But no place is perfect within the material world. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the fourth floor we're going to have doll projects. Doll exhibits. So there's an open balcony up there and I want to do something like that, see up there with the glass, the balcony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I want to do that. Because there's an open balcony right on the street side, enclose it with glass, it would be very popular. After going to see the doll exhibits people can sit there comfortably take, you know, rest on the bench. And it can be seen from outside so it will be indirectly an advertisement. You'll see that there are people sitting there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...artists that work on your books, they have to train many devotees to paint because one day in all the government buildings there will be paintings of Kṛṣṇa. Just like now they have all these paintings of so-called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are selling, you can sell these pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think they will sell. [break] ...popular is that at colleges they like to have art shows come where they display the paintings and then they move on to another college. So we can do that with some of our art paintings also. They will give us one hall just to hang the paintings for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many trees have come. [break] ...from stone there is grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have no explanation for this. No one ever asks these questions, Śrīla Prabhupāda, why the grass is coming out of stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our point is why even in moon planet there is stone only, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no living entities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say there is no air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's due to atmosphere, that's their reasoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say stone can be in both places but life, living entities cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They classify organic and inorganic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may talk all rubbish, foolish things, we don't believe it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that on a planet like Jupiter the atmosphere is full of methane which is poisonous, so no life can live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Only here. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...Pacific Ocean one volcano came up and it formed an island and within five years there was grass growing on it. So they tried to say that the seeds of the grass floated in the ocean and reached the island and began to grow. They couldn't explain how it became vegetated so quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why the seeds does not go by air to the other planets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When they first developed the radio, they set up a system to send out radio messages into outer space. And their idea was that if there was any intelligence on other planets they would answer by sending...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So whether your radio message reach there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We should wait, Śrīla Prabhupāda, a minute, because police over there, they may object if we walk. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...only in America (laughter). All intelligence monopolized by America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sounds like the old British policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foolish policy. Just like the deaf man, he thinks everyone is deaf. You know that? This is psychology. Deaf man will think that everyone is deaf. Broadcast radio message in the Pacific Ocean, the aquatics they do not reply, that means there is no life? Rascal theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, maybe they speak a different language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They don't understand that there may be different mediums of communication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The government announces to the public that so much money from the taxes has to be spent on this space exploration. But according to the information that you're giving us it is not possible for them to be spending so much money to photograph Phoenix so they must be stealing the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned that in previous ages when there was <span class="Italic">yajña</span> taking place on this planet, sometimes the demigods would come down. So that means that is it possible that they would be communicating with the people of this planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. They're speaking Sanskrit language. In all other planets they are speaking Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You also said they had the ability to make themselves visible or invisible to the population. Actually, they have many sightings of what they call UFO's, so-called spaceships and things like this, or things that they cannot explain but the government doesn't release the information because they think that people will panic. Sometimes aircraft pilots, they've reported that their aircrafts are being inspected while they're up in the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inspection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who inspects?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well they don't know who. But there's all kinds of things that they can't explain, but they don't release the information. What the scientists can't explain they won't tell anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> After they claimed they have landed on the moon they announced that they wanted to build a gigantic dome on the moon's surface and within the dome they would have these pumps pumping air and in that way earth people could go to the moon and live there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what happened to their project? Stopped now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're going to do it on Mars instead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're going to do it on Mars instead. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...do it on the moon because they want to have people go there to drill into the surface of the moon to see if there are any valuable minerals or jewels underneath the surface. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is a modern sculpture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says <span class="Italic">jaya</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the kind of artwork that they're putting up everywhere now (bangs on the sculpture).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hollow. Called the formless form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's supposed to be pleasing to the eye, it's supposed to bring pleasant thoughts into the mind. (laughter) It simply makes them crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's like the "emperor's new clothes." Everyone thinks it is pleasing because the leaders or the artists say it is pleasing. Everyone is being fooled. And if they say it is meaningless then they are called a fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bengali it is called <span class="Italic">pare mukhe jhalma(?).</span> Somebody says "Oh, it is very hot!" "Oh, it is very hot!" (laughter) He did not taste, but the other man says "Oh, it is very hot!" So he says "Oh, it is very hot!" <span class="Italic">Pare mukhe jhalma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The city pays these artists hundreds of thousands of dollars to make these forms. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...it is constructed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Metropolitan Museum of Art extension.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can return back now. This one is older, this is new. There are twice as many floors in the same amount of space. It's actually double. [break] ...think there's an advancement in living conditions. Seems to be worsening, but they're taking it as advancement. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> About the same as Mercedes. Ten thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nandaki, is it as good mechanically as a Mercedes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mercedes is very sturdy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The comfort's better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But after two years this all becomes finished, all this. Starts falling apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Mercedes is strong. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, Mercedes is strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very long lasting. (pause) But Mercedes they say it's supposed to last about two hundred thousand kilometers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The engine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Europe most of the taxi drivers use Mercedes because they are so long lasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That means the engine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the body also lasts. Good quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You see them ten years old, still running. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...telling you that the Māyāpura time, the <span class="Italic">Rāma-navamī</span> comes in April, <span class="Italic">Gaura-pūrṇimā</span> is in March, it will take a total of six weeks. This year our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> book distribution was set back severely on account of the over-long duration of the festival and all of the devotees and GBC men wanted that it should be about three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the problem is that Gopāla Kṛṣṇa is saying that he wants all of the devotees to stay there for the opening of the Bombay temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not necessary. Because there is at least, there would be still about a hundred, hundred-fifty devotees there anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them. They can go sometime later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Or the next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Some batches may go this year, some batches may go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The following year, <span class="Italic">Gaura-pūrṇimā</span> festival there can be a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> program in Bombay. Then they can visit it the next year. The main point is we don't have to be there for the opening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As you recall perhaps, in Māyāpura, we discussed that we would like to go in Vṛndāvana first and end the festival in Māyāpura on <span class="Italic">Gaura-pūrṇimā. </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That way we'll get the cooler weather and we'll get the best preaching in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...so dismantled and constructed this building. When I was ten years before, they were dismantled. Very nice building. Just to change the fashion, they spend so much. [break] ...walking generally this. [break] ...producing company?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is Rockefeller Center?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Now they have designed these buildings so that many of them have fountains and big courtyards and you can walk from one street to the other by going through the center of the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And in the middle of the courtyard they have this crazy sculpture. All over the city. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...some of our artists make big sculpture out of metal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No. That's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Philosophically not possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because some of our men here who have helped to make this wall, the front wall of the temple that we're making in front of the Deities, they are artists and they have the ability to cast large, they've done this previously,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them do some small first of all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And show you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right. They say that they can do it very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What will it look like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three, three foot, four foot (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, that's the first thing. First thing we're going to cast is <span class="Italic">Pañca-tattva</span> for installation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But it must be very nice, just like in Jaipur they have made those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You have to find a material which is strong and light so you can ship it easily to the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Brass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Or plexiglass, or fiberglass I mean, fiberglass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṣṭa-dhātu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eight metals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like they are in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, you mean for Deities, Deities are different, I thought you meant art for the temple rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. (end)</div>
