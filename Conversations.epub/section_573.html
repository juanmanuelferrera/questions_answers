<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...cannot become a medical practitioner by simply reading the books. He must study under a medical practitioner. So in the case of your books, is it possible to become a devotee without actually having personal association with you? Just by reading your books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not that you have to associate with the author. But one who knows, if you cannot understand you have to take lesson from him. Not necessarily that you have to contact with the author always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Just like the textbooks are not written by the teachers; they're written by other professors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Usually you don't even meet the author.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply one who knows the subject matter, he can explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But can your, would your purports, would that serve as explanation besides...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, anyone who knows the subject matter, he will be able to explain. Not necessarily the author is required to be present there. [break] ...to study from a medical man, I never said you have to study from the author. Or one who understood the author's purpose. Just like we are explaining <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Not that one has to learn directly from Kṛṣṇa. One who has understood Kṛṣṇa, from him. That is <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Also in the lecture last night, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were saying that after the water subsides, then the trees come out, and then the insects, then the birds. That would indicate that the creation takes place in stages?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It would indicate that the creation of this universe takes place in stages, over quite a long period of time, and this is what the scientists also claim. Darwin's theory is similar to that, that first there was water, then vegetation came up, and then gradually, gradually, each and every species evolved, like that. So is there some correlation between those?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the varieties of creation, not that everything is coming like that. Just like Brahmā was first created, the first intelligent man. So although there was water, he was above water. He was on the lotus flower, which is not in the water. So that is also creation. So suppose this part is not covered by water-you see grass. But where there is lake there is no grass. So both things are there. Somewhere where there is water, unless the water is dried up, there is no grass. But somewhere you will find, immediately, grass. But there is no water. Or above water. So far the material elements are concerned, that is this stage. But the material elementary presentation, in different places, different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> From the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> we understand, though, that Brahmā first created human species of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So if he created the human species of life, how is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that other's creation was there. Just like Lord Śiva. He began to create all demons. The Brahmā stopped it. So somebody was creating demons, somebody was creating animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Oh, different Manus, uh, different procreators were creating different types.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Paramahaṁsa was... we were discussing this morning about the species of life. We understood that there is actually all the species of life on this one planet, or some species don't exist here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everywhere the same process. Everywhere there are living entities in different forms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrut akī rti:</span> The 8,400,000 species is for the whole universe or for each planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. No, whole universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So not all of those species are on this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, all of them are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> On this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> And the demigods we cannot see. Like the demigods, the higher human species, we cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You, why do you believe on your seeing? That is the defect. That is the defect of the Westerners. They are very deficient; still they say, "I cannot see." What is your seeing power? Suppose if Nārada comes, some demigods come, but you cannot see. Just like when Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva appeared, Prahlāda was seeing. "Is your God here?" "Yes." And he could not see. So why do you believe so much on your seeing? You have to attain seeing power. That is very good example, Prahlāda... Hiraṇyakaśipu asking Prahlāda, "Where is your God?" "My God is everywhere." "He is on the pillar?" "Yes." So he was seeing, but he was not seeing. He became angry and broke the pillar. "Let me see, where is your God." This is the position. So one has to create the eyes to see things. Not that whatever eyes you have got you can see everything. No. Just like motorcar is being driven, a child is seeing that the car is running automatically. And the father is seeing, "No, there is driver."</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So the seeing of the child and seeing of the father is different. In our childhood we were thinking that in the gramophone box there is a man. And the fan there is a ghost. (laughter) I remember quite. "How these records are being played? There must be one man. He is singing." And the electric fan was running, I was thinking there is some ghost. This is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The demons are trying to go to the heavenly planets by building their skyscrapers higher and higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāvaṇa's, Rāvaṇa's staircase for going to the heaven. He promised that "Oh, what is the use of austerity? I shall make a staircase directly. You can go." As their... It is the same, Rāvaṇa's staircase and the modern attempt to go to the moon planet, the same thing. They will never be able to go, but imagining that "We shall do it." The same process, Rāvaṇa's process. For how many years they are going? Since 1950?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> To the moon expedition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, moon expedition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Maybe 1955.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> 1955.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The first moon landing was 1961.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is beginning. First of all they sent dog. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Space dog. Space mouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Space mouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Space monkey also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So since 1955 even. So twenty years, what they have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Spent billions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, simply they have brought little dust, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Now they have found that that same dust is here on the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply propaganda. They are not going. Now the Russian scientist and American scientist are combined. Because both of them thieves, so one thief is asking, "Don't expose me. I will not expose you, so that our business will go on." This is the way. "Let us combine together and cheat these rascals, and otherwise, if you expose me, then I will expose you. Then our business will stop."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are cooperating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cooperating. Thief, thief's cooperation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> in Canto Two, it's mentioned here that without discrimination both the demigods and the demons worship the Lord as devotees in the Lord's personal abode. I was wondering if you could explain how this is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the explanation of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Those who are devotees... You can see the devotees, they are gods, demigods. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved daivaḥ. Viṣṇu-bhakta,</span> those who are devotees of Viṣṇu, Vaiṣṇava, they are demigods. So why do you say we do not see the demigods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It also says the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demons, those who are not devotees. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved daiva āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ.</span> Those who are opposing these Vaiṣṇavas, they are <span class="Italic">asuras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But how is it that a demon is worshiping the Lord? It says in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> he just read, that the demons are also worshiping the Lord in His personal abode.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When the demon is promoted to the Vaikuṇṭha, they also become. Just like you are all now Vaiṣṇava. (laughter) Why don't you compare with yourself? The others are seeing, "What these <span class="Italic">mlecchas, yavanas,</span> how they can become Vaiṣṇava?" They are seeing like that. Therefore they object. The Vṛndāvana, "How these Europeans can worship Deity?" They are protesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We can show them this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, there are many verses. When one is qualified, he is no longer demon. [break] ...big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> So I was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span>, they are now saying, "How this <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> is doing? He was a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> He never lived with us." They are saying in that way. [break] Tree has spread the roots solid standing. Just see how carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> In the courtyard back at the temple I would like to grow one <span class="Italic">nim</span> tree. Would that be nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nim</span> tree, how you can get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I think we can grow. Get some seed from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Scientists cannot purify the sea water and use it profusely. Why they are depending on rain? Let them purify it and take so much water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's a very costly process, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Therefore I am asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Kṛṣṇa is doing it. He is taking the water from the sea and putting it up in the sky, and it becomes very pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Millions and millions of tons water taken and distributed. Why their scientists so proud of their achievement? What they can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Hm. It is amazing. There is no factory in the sky to purify the water. Simply by the evaporation of the sun, the water is held up in the sky, and immediately it comes down pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And it is stored on the mountain head and it comes down. Eternal supply. Whole year's supply through the rivers, huge water. You have seen that, what is name, Niagara Falls?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes. You have seen? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Huge water. There are many falls like that. Clean, clear, nice, sweet water is coming. There is sweet-water sea also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> In the sea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not here. In the sky. There is sweet water, very sweet, nice water, drinking water, sea. Sea of ghee, sea of yogurt, sea of milk. Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> There is a government house. Simply a monument now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The governor lives there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes. They still let them fly the flag, the British flag.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> British flag?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They still let them fly the British flag on top of the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have disconnected the British?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes, but there is some traditional respect. [break] When you were speaking with the priest yesterday, he was saying the chanting is material because it comes out of the mouth and it's made like a material sound vibration. Would it be possible for them to run scientific tests on the chanting, the sound of Hare Kṛṣṇa, to make a distinction between that sound and let's say the sound of an automobile's horn? Would that be perceptible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the same sound. Sound is the same; when you are impure, this is material. Just like the tongue is the same, but when you are suffering from jaundice, you are tasting sugar as bitter, and when you will be cured, then the same tongue will taste it is sweet. So it depends on the purification of the body. Whole this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> or any yoga, the whole system is purification. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyet sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Our existence is now impure. Therefore we have to accept birth, death, old age, and disease. And when it is purified, without any contamination, then there is no birth, death, old age. In diseased condition you cannot relish. Even if you are given actually <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> you will not taste it very nice. If there is no appetite, even it is <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> it is useless. Spiritual life means curing the contamination of material disease. That is spiritual life. And when you are purified, you relish the spiritual taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That is a subjective experience. When you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa you can say, "Oh, I feel good," but to someone who won't chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, if there was some objective way of measuring the difference between the Hare Kṛṣṇa sound and the sound of, let's say, someone's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the sound is the same. I gave you the example. The tongue is the same, but according to your condition of life you taste differently. Tongue is not different. But if you are diseased, then with this tongue you taste something else. And if you are in healthy condition, with the same tongue you can taste differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So Śrīla Prabhupāda, if the sound is the same, does that mean that when you become fully purified you will also see the sound of an automobile horn as transcendental?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is transcendental, this microphone, because it is being used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. The same flower, when you use it for sense gratification, it is material. The same flower when you offer to Kṛṣṇa, it is spiritual. The flower is not different, but by the different use it becomes material and spiritual. I think I have said many times that there is actually no material existence. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> means it has no actual existence. We create an atmosphere. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Atmosphere of forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">māyā. Anartha. Anartha,</span> unnecessary. <span class="Italic">Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> If this park is given to us, we can immediately make it Vaikuṇṭha. We know how to do it. But it is not given to us. The same electric energy is creating heater and cooler. For the cooler there is no different electric energy. And for the heater there is no different-the same electric. Similarly, the material and spiritual is coming from Kṛṣṇa's energy.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">How Kṛṣṇa's energy can be material? That is spiritual. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that "These material elements, they are also My energy." So how Kṛṣṇa's energy can be material? <span class="Italic">Bhinna,</span> separated, a little separated, that's all. Separated means as soon as you separate Kṛṣṇa from anything, that is material. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you have to dovetail everything with Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be spiritual. As soon as you say these demons they separate Kṛṣṇa, "What is Kṛṣṇa? What is God? We are scientist, we are technicians and so on, so on. We create our own thing." That means they don't dovetail with Kṛṣṇa. Therefore they are materialist. When we want to enjoy life without Kṛṣṇa, that is material. And Kṛṣṇa gives chance, "All right, you enjoy without Me." And when he is disgusted, then Kṛṣṇa comes once, "Now you have experienced. You haven't got happiness. Now give up this attitude to enjoy without Me." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span>... [Bg. 18.66].</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">"Do it." This is going on. The rascals, they want to enjoy life without Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are dancing with Kṛṣṇa; the dancing is here also, ball dance. Why they do not get any pleasure? Without Kṛṣṇa. You dance with Kṛṣṇa, you get real pleasure. So our business is to educate people that "Everything is Kṛṣṇa. You try to understand." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You are trying to forget Kṛṣṇa. That is your argument. Just like the materialistic person argue, "Why shall I do this? Why shall I go to Kṛṣṇa?" They argue simply this. Actually, there cannot exist anything without Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam,</span> Kṛṣṇa says. "All this, whatever you see, that is My expansion of energy. Everything is resting on Me." <span class="Italic">Mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Everything is on Me." <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ teṣu avasthitaḥ.</span> By <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> gradually he develops that everything-<span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]-everything is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> That <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is very rare who can see everywhere Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> How it is realized...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Some people want to artificially jump to that stage of seeing everything is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That stage is attained after many many births. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate.</span> When one is actually wise, he can see, "Oh, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti,</span> everything is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> That is very rare." <span class="Italic">Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛ</span>...<span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.13]. At that time he is under the control of spiritual energy. And what is the sign? <span class="Italic">Bhajanty ananya-manasaḥ.</span> He has no other business than to render service to Kṛṣṇa. That's all. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It says this tree is dangerous in a high wind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It will break.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And this path is not dangerous? (laughter) Everything is dangerous in the material world. <span class="Italic">Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām [SB </span>10.14.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> In every step there is danger. That is material life. [break] ...they claim equal rights man and woman. Why in the lavatory they are different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They also want to have the same there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is difference? Ladies and gents. Why not equal right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> In some of our modern universities they are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Advancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, foolishness. But at least somewhere there is no equal right in the lavatory. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Greeting someone) I have received your letter, you can see me. [break] (Conversation continues in the car) This too much intermingling of woman means the path of hell. Therefore the restriction is that only the married couple can freely mix, not others. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevāṁ dvār</span>... That is the defect of the modern civilization. They are not interested associating with devotees. They are interested associating with man or woman, that's all. Woman is interested to associate with man, and man is interested to associate with woman. <span class="Italic">Yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam.</span> Therefore the civilization is becoming hellish. It is already said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> One should associate with spiritually advanced men, but that is not being done. Now the woman is hankering after man, man is hankering after woman. <span class="Italic">Yoṣit saṅg... Yoṣit</span> means for sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Tamo-dvāram.</span> This is the path of darkness.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Just like the priest was saying, "Oh, sex is very nice. Why you stop?" Just see. And he is a priest. Why the Roman Catholics they are ordered not to marry? Why? Roman Catholic are supposed... the fathers and priests, they should remain unmarried, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes. They remain celibate. He was saying that it is a personal preference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They have no general rule. It's just that if you want to be celibate, then that's very nice, but if you want to have sex life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they have recommended this, unless there is some benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Well, that knowledge has been lost through the years. A few hundred years ago, many of the celibates were also vegetarian, but all that has changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are gliding down towards hell, that's all. <span class="Italic">Yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam.</span> Now they are coming to the platform of homosex. This is their advancement, spiritual advancement. <span class="Italic">Yoṣitāṁ saṅgi-saṅgam.</span> This is Coca-cola, everywhere. [break] ... <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> liberation, and the word salvation is the same? Then what is the meaning of salvation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Salvation means to be saved, liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what do they mean by that liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Salvation means to be saved by Jesus. Saved by Jesus means to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the platform of that saving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> To go to heaven, spiritual world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is idea of spiritual world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, there is kingdom of God, but they have vague idea. They say no man has seen God, nor has he seen His kingdom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how Jesus saw?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Well, he was not of this world. When they say no man of this world has seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyone who is not of this world, he can see. That we say also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But they say that no man has seen it nor described it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No man has seen it, then how Jesus says that there is kingdom of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He said there is the kingdom of God, but he never described it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you cannot understand it, you rascals. He said that "Thou shall not kill" and you killed him. You are so intelligent. "And first of all let us kill this man who is advising 'Thou shall not kill.' " Your intelligence is so sharp. <span class="Italic">Guru-māra-vidyā.</span> First of all kill the guru. That is called <span class="Italic">guru-māra-vidyā.</span> Guru advised that you take food in goodness, <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span> So he first of all advised that don't take fish, just like we are advising, meat, eggs, don't take. Then they thought that "The cow is very pure. Cow is very pure, so let us eat cow, <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That is pure, <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "Every part of the cow is pure, so we can eat every part of it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when Guru Mahārāja inquired that "You have given up everything bad?" "Yes, now we are eating cow." "What?" "No, it is <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span>" "No, no, no, no, no. You cannot eat even." Then they thought, "Then what we shall eat? Guru Mahārāja is <span class="Italic">sāttvika,</span> most <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span> So let us eat him." (laughter) So it is called <span class="Italic">guru-māra-vidyā.</span> "For <span class="Italic">sāttvika</span> eating, let us eat Guru Mahārāja." This is intelligence. "Why so much botheration seeking here and there? The Guru Mahārāja is there." (end)</div>
