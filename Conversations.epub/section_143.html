<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called? Lunatic, compact in thought. (chuckles) So Kṛṣṇa lover is also another kind of lunatic effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Except that it would mean concentrating all my consciousness on the one single image of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not image.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Or the one single thought or name or feeling or awareness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have got varieties of duties. Just like we are. You have seen all these boys. They are always engaged. Always engaged. Similarly, everywhere they are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa. We want extra time to work for Kṛṣṇa. The twenty-four hours is not sufficient for us. Yes. Then we shall see that we are sleeping, wasting time. Gosvāmīs, they used to sleep for one half-hour only. That also sometimes forgot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> To dream?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They were always engaged. Volumes of books they have written. When there is no writing, chanting, dancing, talking, and like that-engaged in Kṛṣṇa always. That we have been taught by our Guru Mahārāja, twenty-four hours engagement with Kṛṣṇa. So māyā has no scope to enter in our mind. She always remains aloof: "Oh, here is fire. I cannot touch." <span class="Italic">Bhakti mukulitāñ... Bhaktis tvayi sthiratarā yadi bhagavan syād daivena phalati divya-kiśora-mūrtiḥ, muktir mukulitāñjaliḥ sevate 'smān.</span> Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, a great devotee, he executed devotional service for seven hundred years. He lived for seven hundred years in Vṛndāvana. That picture you have seen, Sūradāsa? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Sūradāsa, the poet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is known as Sūradāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Teacher of Tulasī Dāsa, or student of Tulasī Dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may be different, but Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, he was also blind. He made himself blind. You know the story of Bilvamaṅgala?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, in his previous life, he elevated himself to the loving stage of Kṛṣṇa. Not exactly, just previous, <span class="Italic">bhāva.</span> It is called <span class="Italic">bhāva,</span> ecstasy. But some way or other, he could not finish, so according to the instruction of Bhagavad-gītā, he was given birth to a nice <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. (aside:) You can call that Bengali lady. She can hear. So very rich. <span class="Italic">Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">,</span> in that way. Rich family, at the same time, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. But richness, generally, sometimes glide down to wine, women, and intoxication. So by bad company he became woman-hunter, prostitute-hunter. So he was too much addicted to one woman, Cintāmaṇi. So his father died, and he was... He did not marry. In your country it is called girlfriend, and in our country it is called prostitute. So he was that about that prostitute, Cintāmaṇi. So he was performing the rituals, but he was thinking of his girlfriend, that Cintāmaṇi, "When I shall go there?" Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura? Yes. So he asked his servants, "Give me some food. I shall go to Cintāmaṇi." So anyway, he performed... Did not perform. His mind was there. He took some nice foodstuff, and when he went, there was a big river, and it was raining heavily, and the river was flooded. So he thought, "How shall I go the other side?" So one dead body was floating. So he thought, "It is a log," and he took the help of the log and went the other side. And it was heavy raining. And then, when he reached that Cintāmaṇi's home, he saw the door is locked already. Blocked. So he jumped over the wall, taking the tail of a serpent, and when he reached inside, he knocked the door, and Cintāmaṇi was astonished. "How did you come? So heavy rain. You had to cross the river." He said everything, that "Oh, I cannot stay without you." So she was much inquisitive: "How did you come? How did you jump over this wall?" And so he showed everything, that there was a big snake, and so he thought it as rope and jumped it. And then, when he went to the riverside, he saw that was a dead body. So at that time Cintāmaṇi thought, "Oh, this man is so much addicted to me." So she told, "Oh, this much attraction if you would have with Kṛṣṇa, oh, how nice your life would have been." So immediately he came to his senses because he was lifted to that position in his previous life. So immediately he left and was going alone to Vṛndāvana. And on the way he saw another beautiful woman. So his business was to be attracted by woman. So he again became attracted. So he was following. So this woman, after entering, she told her husband, "Just see, this man is following from a distant place." So he asked him, "Oh, come on." He saw he is nice gentleman. He was a rich man, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> "What is this?" He said plainly, "Oh, I have been attracted by your wife, by the beauty of your wife." "All right, come on. What is that?" You enjoy my wife. You are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> You are..." So he was received well. And at night, when he was given place, then he asked that woman, "Mother, will you give me your hair pin?" He took the hair pin and pushed in the eyes: "Oh, these eyes are my enemy." Since then he became blind. And in that blindness he was worshiping Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa was coming to him. And he would not touch. He'll sing, dance, and He'll supply milk and go away. So this Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura wrote one book, <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta.</span> It is very valuable book. That is very highly estimated, Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What century is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is since seven hundred years...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian Woman):</span> Fourteenth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, fourteenth century.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Bilda... How do you pronounce his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Fourteenth century, not Bilvamaṅgala. Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura, some time before(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Bilvamaṅgala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Bilvamaṅgala. Bilvamaṅgala. No, I didn't know the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many poets. He was great poet. If you read this <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-karṇāmṛta</span> poetry, ah, you'll find...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Vaiṣṇava, (Bengali) ...Vidyāpati, Candidāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vidyāpati, Candidāsa, Jayadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Jayadeva, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Jayadeva is a great Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many nice poets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I know some of the Baul poetry in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You just try to read this Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura especially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Nartham.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Narottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That song you were reading last night, <span class="Italic">Nitāi pada kamala?</span> That is Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura's song. For the Vaiṣṇava, to become poet is another qualification. Vaiṣṇava has twenty-six qualifications. I think it is written there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And one of them is to become poet also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Poet. He must be poet. All the Vaiṣṇavas, they are poet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because they are so deep in love with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Poetry comes out in deep love with something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Is that published somewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Arjuna just typed it up, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> You want to see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No, don't take it down. I'll look. On my way out I'll read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hṛṣīkeśa, you can read loudly. We'll hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛṣīkeśa:</span> "Qualifications of devotee: 1) kind to everyone, 2) does not quarrel with anyone, 3) fixed in the Absolute Truth, 4) equal to everyone, 5) faultless, 6) charitable, 7) mild, 8) clean, 9) simple, 10) benevolent, 11) peaceful, 12) completely attached to Kṛṣṇa, 13) no material hankering, 14) meek, 15) steady, 16) self-controlled, 17) does not eat more than required, 18) sane, 19) respectful..." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not insane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛṣīkeśa:</span> "...20) humble, 21) grave, 22) compassionate, 23) friendly, 24) poetic, 25) expert..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Poetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛṣīkeśa:</span> "...25) expert, and 26) silent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are the qualities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Whose list is that? Is that an old list or have you made that up for young Americans?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, these are taken from authoritative <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> Yes. This is the test, whether you are becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious or not. You have to test yourself, whether you are developing these qualities. This is for testing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I'm slowly developing all qualities except sanity. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Insanity for seeking Kṛṣṇa, that is required. Yes. Unless you become insane after Kṛṣṇa just like Lord Caitanya became... Yes. His worship is to become insane after Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Is Kabir in the Vaiṣṇava tradition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> He is mystic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So what tradition is he in, actually?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is impersonalist on the whole. He is impersonalist, whole, and he has got some Vaiṣṇava thought. That's all, perverted thoughts. Perverted thoughts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So who is the most perfect of the Vaiṣṇava poets? That would be Mīrā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Mīrā was a devotee. She was a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotee means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Vaiṣṇava. She was, Mīrā, Kṛṣṇa devotee. Oh, her songs has called me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Have you used her songs here at all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in India it is very popular, Mīrā's song. Mostly they are written in Hindi, and some of them have been interpolated. But Mīrā was a devotee. She saw Rūpa Gosvāmī, a contemporary. She has written many poetry about Lord Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Oh, she was a contemporary of Caitanya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Did they meet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. She appreciated that Lord Caitanya is Kṛṣṇa, and she has written one poetry, song, that "Now You have left aside Your flute, and You have taken the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> rod." In that way she has written nice poetry. "And where is Your hair and peacock feather? Now You are bald-headed." In this way. So Mīrā appreciated. Her life is also very excellent. Her father gave her a small Kṛṣṇa doll to play, and she developed love for Kṛṣṇa as husband. So when she was married... She was princess, daughter of king, and she was married with another prince.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What position does Anandamayi Ma have now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is also impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> She is impersonalist</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is not a devotee. There are many impersonalists. They take advantage of... They say, "Caitanya's <span class="Italic">patha,</span> Śaṅkara's <span class="Italic">maṭha,"</span> that "Follow the principle of Caitanya but ultimately take the conclusion of Śaṅkara." That means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Śiva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Śaṅkarācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Aha. What was the conclusion of Śaṅkarācārya?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya's conclusion was to defeat Buddhism. They do not know it, but actually, when there was too much animal-killing and people became almost atheist under the shadow of Vedic rituals, Lord Buddha appeared. He wanted to stop men from the sinful activities of killing unnecessarily under the plea of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So he invented that <span class="Italic">ahiṁsa,</span> nonviolence. And... Because people will give evidence, "Oh, in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> there is..." They are not following, actually, the Vedic rituals, but just like crooked lawyers take advantage of law books, similarly... Therefore, Lord Buddha said that "I do not follow Vedic rituals. I have nothing to do with <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is my own formula." So Jayadeva has written one prayer because the Vaiṣṇavas can understand how God is playing. So he writes, <span class="Italic">nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātaṁ:</span> "My dear Lord, now You have appeared as Lord Buddha. You are decrying the Vedic rituals." <span class="Italic">Śruti-jātaṁ. Śruti-jātaṁ</span> means Vedic. Why? <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya-darṣita-paśu-ghātam:</span> "You are so much compassionate to see poor animals being killed unnecessarily." <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare:</span> "All glories to Jagadīśa. You have now assumed the form of Lord Buddha, and You are playing in pastimes." So Lord Buddha is accepted as incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> also it is stated. He is accepted as the tenth incarnation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ah. Who was nine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nine was Baladeva. Baladeva, Kṛṣṇa's elder brother Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Then Buddha is one possible tenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not tenth. Buddha is ninth. Yes. Buddha is ninth. Baladeva is eighth. And the tenth is awaiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Kalki.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kalki.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Now, what is Kalki's nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kalki's nature, that is described in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> He will come just like a prince, royal dress with sword, and on horseback, simply killing, no preaching. All rascals killed. No more preaching. (laughing) That is the last. There will be no brain to understand what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> There will be no brain to understand God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They will be so dull, so dull. It requires brain to understand. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">evaṁ prasanna-manaso</span> [SB 1.2.20]<span class="Italic">,</span> "fully joyful," <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti-yoga,</span> "by practice of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga." Evaṁ prasanna-manaso bhagavad-bhakti-yogataḥ, mukta-saṅgasya:</span> "and freed from all material contamination." He can understand God. Do you think God is so cheap thing, anyone will understand? Because they do not understand, they present something nonsense: "God is like this. God is like that. God is like that." And when God Himself comes, that "Here I am, Kṛṣṇa," they don't accept it. They'll create their own God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So Kalki comes at the end of the Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And is Kalki connected with the Kali-yuga cycle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kalki, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So He would come at the end of Kali-yuga to end the <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then Satya-yuga will begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Then what begins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Satya-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Which is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Satya-yuga, the pious. Satya-yuga. People will be pious, truthful, long-living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Are those people that remain or whatever new creation comes out of the destruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them will remain, some of them. It will not completely extinguish. Some of them will remain, pious. <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> All miscreants will be killed, and out of them, there must be some pious... They remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Do you think of this in terms of a historical event that will occur in the lifetime of your disciples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This will happen at least 400,000's of years after, at least. So by that time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> They will go down, down, down for 400,000 years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So at that time my disciples will be with Kṛṣṇa. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And those who will not follow them, they will see the fun, how they are being killed. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> 400,000 years. Will people still be chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in 400,000...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Hare Kṛṣṇa will be finished within ten thousand years. There will be no more Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ah. So what will be left?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. Left will be I'll kill you and eat you, and you shall kill me. You shall eat me. That will be left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> After ten thousand years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There will be no grain, no milk, no sugar, no fruit. So I have to eat you, and you will have to eat me. Full facility for meat-eating. (laughter) Full facility. Kṛṣṇa is very kind. He'll give you facility: "All right. Why cows and calves? You take your own son. Yes. Eat nicely." Just like serpents, snakes, they eat their own offsprings, tigers. So this will happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Kali eats her own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And there will be no brain to understand, no preacher, nothing else. Go. Go to, to the dog. And then Kṛṣṇa will come: "All right, let me kill you so that you are saved." So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> But you see it as actually a historical thing of ten thousand years for the chanting, of the diminishing chanting of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, then do you think more people will chant Hare Kṛṣṇa or fewer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. More people. Now it will increase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Until?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to ten thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then diminish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So what is the purpose of right now, a world increase...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People will take advantage of this up to ten thousand years. Then they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So this is like the last rope, the last gasp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. So the sooner we take to shelter, shelter of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, then, according to Vedic theory, when did this <span class="Italic">yuga</span> begin? According to this Vedic theory... Or... This is <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> When did this <span class="Italic">yuga...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Begin from this Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He introduced five hundred years ago, and it will continue now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kali-yuga has begun five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Began five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> But this wave within Kali-yuga, in which Hare Kṛṣṇa increases and then diminishes, is about ten thousand years and that began five hundred years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kali-yuga, the duration of life of Kali-yuga is 432,000's of years. Out of that, we have passed five thousand years. There is balance, 427,000's of years. Out of that, ten thousand years is nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Where is all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic literature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa, Purāṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Has the detailed analysis of what goes on within the Kali-yuga?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes, yes. I'll read you sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> There are translations of that. There are some translations of that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the Twelfth Canto, the Kali-yuga descriptions are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Twelfth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twelfth Canto. And you will find that all the descriptions are coming to be true. Just like there is one statement, <span class="Italic">svīkaram eva udvahe:</span> "Marriage will be performed simply by agreement." Now that is being done. And <span class="Italic">lāvaṇyaṁ keśa-dharaṇam:</span> "People will think that he has become very beautiful by keeping bunch of hairs." That is coming true. These are written there. All things are there in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa</span> is there also provision for the Caitanya cult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇam [SB </span>11.5.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have given that in that book, our <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span> That is the first quotation there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So it's on this quotation from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa</span> that Caitanya built His system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is program, already presented, and He came to execute the program. Just like our meeting is already programmed. I come and execute it. That's all. That was previous. Clearly it is said, " 'In the Kali-yuga the Supreme Lord comes as one who always chants the holy name of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, who is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, whose complexion is yellow.' <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> Eleventh Canto, Fifth Chapter, 32nd verse."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It's in there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have accepted Lord Caitanya as Kṛṣṇa not fanatically. There are evidence in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> in <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> in <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> in all Vedic scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, then, within this period of ten thousand years, only those who hear Kṛṣṇa's name and worship Kṛṣṇa by chanting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is also stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So only those who practice Kṛṣṇa chanting can attain <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They become immediately liberated and go back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And everybody else gets involved deeper and deeper in the <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. So if anyone believes in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> they should take to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is intelligence, to take advantage of authorized scriptures. You'll find in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> There is a history of Candragupta, and "The Yavanas will become kings." That means English occupation, Mohammedan occupation. Everything is there. And Buddha's appearance, <span class="Italic">kikaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati. Kikaṭeṣu</span> means in the Bihar province in India. <span class="Italic">Bhaviṣyati.</span> Because <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Purāṇa</span> was written five thousand years ago, and Lord Buddha appeared about 2,600 years ago. So therefore it is stated, <span class="Italic">bhaviṣyati:</span> "In future, just in the beginning of Kali-yuga, Lord will appear as Buddha. His mother's name will be Añjana, and his business will be to cheat the atheists."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> To cheat the atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sammohāya sūra-dviṣam [SB 1.3.24]. Sūra-dviṣam</span> means atheists. <span class="Italic">Surat. Sura-dvisam</span> means those who are envious of Lord's devotees. That means atheist. So to bewilder them. What is that bewildering? This atheist class, they became so much absorbed in this animal-killing, they forgot everything about God. So they said, "What is God? We don't mind." So Lord Buddha says, "Yes, there is no God." Lord's philosophy is: "There is no God. Void. There is no God. But what I say, you follow. Yes. That's all right." But he is God. Is it not cheating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes, except that he claims to be neither God nor not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? But he never said that "I am God." He said there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> No. He doesn't say there's no God either. He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. That's anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> He says, all conceptions of the existence of the self, as well as all conceptions of the nonexistence of the self, as well as all conceptions of the existence of a supreme self, as well as all conceptions of the nonexistence of the supreme self are equally arbitrary, being only conceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a jugglery of words. So his principle was that they did not believe in God. So still the Buddhists says, "You don't believe in God." So but they are worshiping God, Lord Buddha. There are so many temples. In the same way, as we worship. So this is transcendental cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Transcendental cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckling) Just like sometimes father has to cheat his child. That is not cheating. That is welfare. But apparently it (looks) likes cheating. A child is insistent on some point. "Yes, yes. You are all right. But you do this like this. Yes, you are very good boy." Like that. But Vaiṣṇava, in Vaiṣṇava literature, in Vedic literature, he is God. The godless worshiping God in a different way. If there is nothing, why they should worship Buddha even?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> They don't... Well, strictly speaking, one does not worship Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, they have many big, big temples in Burma and Japan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah. But the practice in the temples is like empty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. That is a little different. That's all. But the temple worship and God worship is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In, like in Zen Buddhism and in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is later invention. Originally Lord Buddha, the statue of Lord Buddha, worshiped all, all over...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Originally there was no Buddha. There was a wheel for the doctrine, for the <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> There was a wheel, and then for a parasol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We see from historical, archeological evidences, all over...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Then, when the Europeans came to India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question, Europeans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Then they made a statue of a human-faced Buddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, no. Buddha's temple was much before then. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What it had as a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. Buddha was a <span class="Italic">yuga-pracāra.</span> That is very old, old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Very old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because I saw the date, the posture of Lord Buddha when he died in a place, in a village, and I saw Buddha 20 feet long, gold Buddha statue, just the way he lied when he was dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> <span class="Italic">Pari nirvāṇa,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Pari nirvāṇa</span> pose, exactly. Twenty-two feet he was, long. And it was made just after his death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> What I had understood is that like the Jews and the Muslims, the original first few centuries of Buddhist meditation made use of a wheel for the <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or a parasol, or a bo tree as the image of Buddha, as at Sanchi. But no, but no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So long Buddha was living. After that, when Buddha died, they started making his statue, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> yes. That is the archeological evidence. Archeological evidence is that Buddha's statues were original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> The museum at Mathurā, I think, had the earliest human statues of Buddha, which are Greek nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because Candragupta's style... (Bengali) And they had many temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Buddha is worshiped by statue. That is historical. That is historical fact. And there are many temples in Burma, China, and in Japan, all these Buddhist countries. But these Buddhist temples began not exactly after Buddha's disappearance. At least, after one thousand years. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. That's much later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, much later. Because when Buddhism was driven out of India, then in Japan, China, Burma, the Buddhism flourished. Yes. That is after, almost after one thousand years. Otherwise whole India was Buddhist, whole India. Sometimes the Jagannātha Temple... They interpret. Actually it is not. They say that is also Buddhist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jagannātha Temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think I told you I had <span class="Italic">darśana</span> with Jagannātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. I got inside the temple. I was silent and made believe I was a mad, a madman. I had long hair, and I had pyjamas, white <span class="Italic">khadi, khadi</span> cloth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like some Punjabi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So I went inside. And when anybody came to ask me anything, because I was afraid of opening my mouth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no enemy of a dumb. <span class="Italic">Bhuvar śatru nyāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> So I just kept my mouth closed and got down on my knees and touched their feet. So they all thought that I was crazy, and so they kept away from me. (laughter) So I got inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. So you had a nice view of Jagannātha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> It was very beautiful. I was there about..., with Peter also, about a week, a week there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you saw once or several times?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> One time. I was afraid to go in and out many times. I figured I got away with it once, and I didn't want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that Aquarian Gospel said that Lord Jesus Christ lived in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (Bengali) Jesus Christ was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was thick and thin with the priest. One priest was very friendly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Vidyāpati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he was discussing philosophical talks with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> According to the Aquarian Gospel, Christ was in Jagannātha Purī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And he saw Ratha-yātrā, and there is, name of Kṛṣṇa is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ratha-yātrā, as we are performing, San Francisco. So Lord Jesus Christ saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> We went to Mathurā also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Mathurā. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> For several days. And Vṛndāvana for about a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You stayed there, Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yeah, about a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You have seen Vṛndāvana nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Well, we went from one temple to another, sang, sat by the river, went to the little garden where the tree is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nidhuvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> And met two <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> devotees. The one I mentioned, Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji and Bankibihari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bankibihari?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. They translate from Mīrābhai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Into English. Good translations. Good translations. They were published in the Bhakti-vidya-bhavan series. In that series. They have four or five books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They have five books they have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> One <span class="Italic">Sufis, Yogis, Saints,</span> poets like Muktesvara. And then another of Mīrā. Two volumes of Mīrā with a life of Mīrā. And then one on the Kumbhamela, a book on the Kumbhamela.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are good scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Yes. Good scholars. They know Blake also. They know English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mataji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Śrīmata Kṛṣṇaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Mathurā, I think this Mātājī lives so(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> In India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. She is not. She does not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> But in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nidhuvana(?). In which year you have been in Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> Which year? 1962.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. At that time I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> We probably passed on the street. (laughs) You were there then? '62.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I left Vṛndāvana 1965. From 1956 I am there, I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I would like to go and live for a while and to stay. I liked it when I was there. It would be a good place to live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> You're going next year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Allen Ginsberg:</span> I think pretty soon I'm going to be going back. Yeah. I have to stabilize the farm I'm on.</div>
