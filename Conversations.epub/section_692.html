<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...money is finished. And there is no use because they have lost India. For India they made all these arrangements. But that India is lost, so what is the use of maintaining? The Gibraltar also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> All of the ships would go around the south of Africa up to England. So they would maintain their shipping route. But now... That's a fact. They don't need it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that Suez Canal is closed, complete?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's open again. [break] It is not as Westernized as in a place like Nairobi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Africans are all thieves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Here there is not as much stealing as in Nairobi. [break] I think they have had to amputate afterwards, mangled by the shore. It happens frequently. On some of the beaches here they've put up signs that "There are many sharks in the water. It is dangerous to bathe here." Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> "Amongst fish, I am the shark." (Prabhupāda chuckles) He shaved off his beard yesterday, this young boy. He shaved off. He had beard. He shaved off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Further progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...900,000 forms of life in the water. How many they have seen? They are giving pictures. [break] Calcium carbonate, oil wintergreen, and soap powder, powder hard soap, and I will make toothpaste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What is this soap powder?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is called powdered hard soap. (end)</div>
