<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one cannot give up the family life, and it was an opportunity to give up family life. So it is blessing in disguise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> I'm sometimes thinking that if my activities were more purified...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Always be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> But trouble is it seems that in my..., engaged in management work, sometimes my spiritual activities suffer. That is unfortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Management is also spiritual activity. Why do you take like that? It is Kṛṣṇa's establishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> But my wife never sees that, unless I am just chanting <span class="Italic">japa</span> and offering Deity worship. Otherwise it's all nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, she is also an woman. She has no much intelligence. But here, to manage Kṛṣṇa's affairs, is also Kṛṣṇa's work. Don't take it otherwise. We must be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's business. That's all. That is our duty. Fighting is very good business? Killing? But why Arjuna...? "Yes." <span class="Italic">Kariṣye vacanam.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. And Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si priyo 'si me:</span> [Bg. 4.3] "You are My devotee, very dear friend." What he was doing? Fighting. The fighting is good business, to kill others? But for Kṛṣṇa's sake... He personally denied, "No, no, no. I don't want this kingdom." Personally he had no desire. But when he saw that Kṛṣṇa wants it, "All right. I shall do it." And this is Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> I always thought that you appreciate it when we try to manage, so therefore I have tried to stay on here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are managing very well. I am very satisfied. Do it. There was no water. Sometimes the tap becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Because so many guests are here today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Some of these boys do not know how to use water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> They wash clothes with three or four buckets of water. But otherwise there's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them should go there, in the pond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> I have just informed today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When you have got that water tank, it is enjoyable, more, to take bath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Yes. It is Ganga water also, Ganga water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So as soon as possible they should go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I bathed there this afternoon. It was all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is very nice. <span class="Italic">Avagana-bhak.</span> (?) To dip into the water is refreshing, very refreshing. It is enjoyable. You artificially create tank in your country, bathing tank. And here is tank. Why should you not enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Swimming pools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Gargamuni Swami says it is contaminated, that water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is contaminated for you, not for us. Why contaminated? So many people are taking. In Bengal, all villagers, they take bath in the pond, this tank. Large quantity, water, is not contaminated. A small quantity, water, is contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Everything is there, the fish and this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> Everything is keeping it clean. So Śrīla Prabhupāda? I have built one home at Māyāpura. Perhaps you have been told. My plan was to leave my wife there because she likes a peaceful place. City life she cannot live. And I would stay in Calcutta, say, four days a week and go on weekends to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Abhirāma:</span> That way there be some separation. At the same time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gradually full separation. And she'll be... (end)</div>
