<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We'd have to break the top and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Break? Why break? Another expenditure. Simply you make two brackets, wooden brackets, like that, and have a tin. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Tin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tin or steel. Why breaking, again another?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. The arch will.... That's all right. Then don't require. Then it is all right. Don't require. [break] It will be colder in Bengal. <span class="Italic">Māghi, Māgha-māsa.</span> Who has done this mischief, "Māyāpura"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Someone put mud over "Māyāpura." This is our land, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> [break] Not so many <span class="Italic">gosas</span> come for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> (break-to room conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "...Sanat Kumāras were going to Vaikuṇṭha to visit Lord Viṣṇu. They were stopped at the door by the doorkeepers, Jaya and Vijaya. But specifically, the Supreme Lord cannot be seen by ordinary eyes. But He now became visible to the eyesight of the Kumāras. Another significant word is <span class="Italic">samādhi-vākyam</span>. Meditators who are very fortunate see the Viṣṇu form of the Lord within their hearts by following the yoga process. But to see Him eye to eye is a different matter. It is only possible for pure devotees. The Kumāras therefore..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">aratika</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They have <span class="Italic">kīrtanas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] They couldn't see the Lord face to face?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dhruva Mahārāja saw face to face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudama:</span> [break] ...factured this in Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] So then the chance is lost. Repeatedly Kṛṣṇa is saying, "You give up all this habit. Just become Kṛṣṇa conscious. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān...</span>" Nobody will hear. "Why shall I not?" There is a Bengali song, <span class="Italic">cakṣe yadi lāge bhālo keno dekhbo nā:</span> "If it is gratifying to my eyes, why shall I not see a beautiful woman? Why you are forbidding me?" <span class="Italic">Cakṣe yadi lāge bhālo:</span> "It is pleasing to my eyes. Why you are forbidding me? This is going on. <span class="Italic">Cakṣe yadi lāge bhālo.</span> If there is little happiness, don't mind it is flickering. It will go on. The Carvaka Muni: <span class="Italic">ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā ghṛtaṁ pibet:</span> "Some way or other prepare foodstuff with ghee." "I have no money." <span class="Italic">Ṛṇaṁ kṛtvā:</span> "Just take. Beg, borrow, steal, bring <span class="Italic">ghee</span> and prepare nice foodstuff and eat and enjoy life." This is the material world. But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "No, no, no. Don't do this. This is the hog's business. <span class="Italic">Tapo.</span> Just try to go, follow austerity." Even those who are so-called advanced in knowledge, <span class="Italic">karmī, jñānī, yogī,</span> they are also after sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> is openly after sense gratification and <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> is subtly. "No, no. This kind of..." <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> "Now I shall enjoy Brahman. I shall become God." This is another side, the same sense enjoyment. Because I have failed becoming a minister or becoming a king, becoming a leader, becoming-I have failed, now I shall become God. Same sense grati.... They cannot understand that this is also sense gratification. "I am not no more satisfied by becoming a little minister and king and.... No. I shall become God. Why shall I.... By becoming king or minister I beg to the goddess of fortune, 'Mother, give me a little money.' Why shall I beg? I shall enjoy her. I become Nārāyaṇa." Same disease. A yogi also, after mystic power they want to show magic: "I shall make like this and gold will be there. People will worship me as I am God." Do that. People do that. If you play something wonderful they will accept you: "Oh, you are God." But he does not know that he cannot become God. That is not possible. Although he gets little fractional authority to puzzle others that he has become God.... Because people are fools, if he can produce little gold like this, they will be immediately amazed: "Oh, how powerful he is." They have no capacity to understand. If God is meant for making gold, why not worship the God who has made already millions of gold mines? Unlimited. There is no limit. Why this paltry god? They have no such knowledge. They are amazed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have to go to so much trouble as well just to achieve that little flickering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very, very great trouble. You have not seen the yogis? Of course, there are some.... But still, they have to undergo very severe processes for achieving this yogic power. And a devotee, they kick it, that "What is this nonsense?" That is devotee. "What is this nonsense? What shall I do by producing gold?" And I never tried for making gold, but is there any scarcity of gold? I never tried for that, how to make gold. That Sai Baba is showing some magic power. What of the Maharsi? Maha.... He was also after some yogic power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were with him. You do not know? "The transcendental meditation-you will get this, you will get that." He is advertising in that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> All material opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Ultimately you will become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the attempt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And in the meantime, you can enjoy material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They never said anything more than you'll just get good sex life and good health.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.... Becoming God means the same, money and sex. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Wouldn't it be handy, though, to be able to fly around without having to use airplanes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I mean, if you had some mystic opulence like being able to fly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the yogis can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Wouldn't that be handy? Couldn't a devotee utilize that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, instead of taking airplanes here and there, you could just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. What is the difference? If by practicing severe yogic means you fly, the birds are also flying. They are flying without airplane. Does it mean that it has become very great? There are many birds, <span class="Italic">garuḍa</span> bird. They can fly from one planet to another. Just like small birds-they fly from one tree to another, take rest again-so they fly from this planet to another. Take rest, again another. What is the value of your airplane? You cannot go to another planet. There are birds; they catch up elephants and take it away for eating. Does it mean he has become, it has become God? There are Siddhaloka planets where the people can go without any airplane from one planet to another, Siddhaloka. They have got all yogic <span class="Italic">siddhi</span> automatically, by birth. Just like we cannot fly, but a small bird, a small fly, from the birth it can fly. There are so many. So similarly, by birth they have got all yogic <span class="Italic">siddhis.</span> This is called Siddhaloka. There are different varieties of planets, different varieties of perfection. Just like here also, I cannot dive into the water. A small fish can dive. I cannot fly in the sky but a small sparrow, it can go from here, here, immediately. Does it mean he is very advanced in yogic power because he can fly? You are proposing that. Nothing is any big achievement. The big achievement is how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is wanted. Not these things. These things.... You cannot do; I can do. I cannot do; he can do. What is the greatness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It seems harder to control the tongue than to fly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It takes more austerity to control one's tongue by chanting and taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even that is not achievement. To control the senses, that is not very great achievement. The great achievement, how we have become a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa. So that will include everything. You haven't got to prepare gold, but if you want gold, Kṛṣṇa will send you. So why should I try for that and waste my time? Let me become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious. That is required. Kṛṣṇa.... <span class="Italic">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham: [Bg. </span>9.22] "I shall give you all protection. I shall supply whatever you want," Kṛṣṇa said. So I shall do such thing when Kṛṣṇa will be my protector and supplier and everything. He is all-powerful, so He will do that-if I require. I don't require anything. I.... Simply I have to become a sincere, pure devotee. But if I require something, it will come from Kṛṣṇa. Why shall I try for it? A rich man's son, he doesn't do anything for earning money. He knows, "My father is rich and as soon as I require money, he will give me. So why shall I become a big, big businessman and become a <span class="Italic">karmī</span>?" <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upāry adhaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> You try for that thing which you did not achieve so long, even if you have traveled from different species of life, different planets. For that thing you try, which you have not achieved. Simply you have become implicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Why bother with something that's available to a hog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Why bother with something that is available even to the hogs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, even if you achieve such thing, achievement, so where is the guarantee that you'll..., it will stay? The so-called achievements for sense gratification, that means body. The body is always troublesome. That day I was asking, "Did you taste the Birla's eggplant?" You said, "No, I could not take it," due to the body. So even things are there, the body will not allow you. There are many rich men, they have got money, but they cannot eat anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That John Paul Getty is the richest man in the world, and they asked him, "What would be your wish if you could have anything?" He said, "I just want to be healthy. I've got so much money but I'm not healthy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many. There was a big, rich man in Calcutta, Raja Jyotindramana Ṭhākura. So just like you give me so many things, he was king, he was getting more supply, but he had no appetite. So one day he was given so many things-because it was routine. So one coolie was going on the street, taking a fish and chanting very pleasingly. So he said that "Instead of becoming Raja Jyotindramana Ṭhākura, if I could have been a coolie like that, at least I could enjoy by eating. And what is this? I have got everything but I cannot eat." He regretted, "I would have become a coolie like that instead of becoming a Ṭhākura."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everybody's mad after getting some big position, and then when they get it they find out it's even worse than where they started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the body does not allow. So all, from all side we were discussing Prahlāda Mahārāja's..., how he is experienced of this material way of life. It is all useless. So by following this <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> devotee we can make our life perfect. Nothing is wanted except Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is perfection of life. That is instruction of.... <span class="Italic">Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarim</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> No, we don't want. Then what do you want? <span class="Italic">Mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatad bhaktir ahaitukī.</span> Without any motive let me become a sincere devotee of.... (end)</div>
