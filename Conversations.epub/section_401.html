<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...yogic practice. So to save oneself from the influence of material laws. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...executed all religious principles. In this way you were able to cleanse your heart and control the influence of material law. In executing your austerities you used to eat only the leaves of the trees which fell to the ground." [break] ...takes birth in other planets are the same Devakī and Vasudeva, His parents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then how is it that after they gave birth to Kṛṣṇa this time they went back to Godhead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, according to the usual way of thinking, we think that if somebody if... Well, that doesn't apply in this case. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the universe, Kṛṣṇa may have another devotee like them. If there is another universe, why not another couple? There is everything another. Because we are limited, we want to make Kṛṣṇa always limited. How it can be? We should always remember Kṛṣṇa's inconceivable omnipotency. [break] ...know how many thousands of couple are there because Kṛṣṇa's, that birth is going on every moment. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">nitya-līlā,</span> in this universe immediately born, that that birth, that pastime, is again immediately manifested in another universe. He has grown old two days; so the same form again in another universe. The same example. Just like 6:30 AM on the sun, solar calculation, immediately in another country, 6:30 AM. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> [break] ...the position of being Kṛṣṇa's parents or hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> or being a cowherd boyfriend, can be filled by different living entities qualified in the different universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But that makes them sound like they are posts instead of individuals. I thought you once said that Arjuna, he always stays in the material universes. He's a person and he always travels with Kṛṣṇa, not that it's a post.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, all the associates of Kṛṣṇa, like Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Right now Kṛṣṇa is in so many different universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> And He is having the same pastimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> And in each universe there is an Arjuna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Everything. So is it the same living soul, Arjuna, in each universe, or a different living being may be taking that position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take it for granted, different. What is the wrong there? After all, everyone is Kṛṣṇa's expansion. <span class="Italic">Ānanda cinmāyā-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are also expansion. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. But still, we have got individuality. Kṛṣṇa proved it-I explained that in Vṛndāvana when everything was stolen by Brahmā. Again another batch of cows and calves and cowherds boys. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Immediately. What is the difficulty for Kṛṣṇa? Is it clear or not? You wanted to clarify. Is it clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, you said the answer is that it's different persons, not just one Arjuna, not just one Yaśodā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I have got hundred branches. Each branch I have got a set of my sitting room, of my books and everything. And wherever I go I see the same place. If it is possible for an ordinary man to have a hundred sets of the same thing, why not for Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So in each branch you have a different cook, different president, different treasurer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the set is there, what I want. The set is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. Now in the case of Jaya and Vijaya, who fell down and took the role of demons, after three births as demons, they were supposed to go back to the spiritual world. So after the three births in this universe, were the same pastimes going on in other universes.?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Whenever Kṛṣṇa desires that He is to fight with somebody, another must prepare himself for fighting, becomes His enemy. Because in the Vaikuṇṭha world there is no chance of fighting, therefore He sends His devotees to become His enemy and there He fights.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So other living entities would play the part of Rāvaṇa in other universes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Or any other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We cannot actually conceive of all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The conclusion is that Kṛṣṇa being the reservoir of all pleasure, so the pleasure of fighting is there. So He can exhibit anywhere. [break] That is the understanding of Kṛṣṇa. As soon as we limit Kṛṣṇa like one of us, or little bigger than me, then I become doctor frog. (aside:) Don't come near. Why don't you tell them? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...Vasudeva attempted to take His son from the delivery room, and exactly at that time, a daughter was born of Nanda and Yaśodā. She was Yogamāyā, the internal potency of the Lord. By the influence of His internal potency, Yogamāyā, all the residents of Kaṁsa's palace, especially the doorkeepers, were overwhelmed with deep sleep and all the palace doors opened although they were barred and shackled with iron chains. The night was very dark, but as soon as Vasudeva took Kṛṣṇa on His lap and went out, he could see everything just as in the sunlight." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) ...he worships like anything. Then he... We have an assembly, and they passed by majority vote that I should refrain from coming here, but I somehow or other came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I saw and offer my obeisances to your motorcar. (laughter) I was thinking that "Dr. Patel's representative, the car is here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) Because we are trained to all the accredited saints of India, to whatever opinion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our business is to point out who is not a saint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But don't point us out. We want the tree to be a saint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our business. Preacher must be. (Hindi) [break] ...can I speak something? Because their position is to take Ramakrishna as a saintly person. Saintly person there may be. Just like Rāvaṇa. He also underwent severe penances, but just to fulfill his personal desire, or Rāvaṇa was so devotee of Lord Śiva that he was cutting his head and offering to the Deity. Is it? You know, everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why he is called <span class="Italic">rākṣasa,</span> not a saintly person? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Because he was trying to en...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will talk. Why he is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> as <span class="Italic">rākṣasa?</span> And not only that... I do not know whether here. In Delhi have seen <span class="Italic">Rāma-līlā,</span> the effigy of Rāvaṇa is beaten with shoes sometimes. But actually he was a great devotee of Lord Śiva. Everyone knows. And he was so big devotee that Lord Śiva gave him all benedictions, "Whatever you want." So why this Rāvaṇa is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> as <span class="Italic">rākṣasa?</span> Why he is not described as a saintly person? He was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> by birth. He was born of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> father, and he was great student of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Materially he was very opulent so that he could control even the demigods. He was so powerful. Still, with all this qualification, why he is described as <span class="Italic">rākṣasa?</span> You answer this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Because he had some fight with... So <span class="Italic">kāma, krodha, moha, lobha,</span> he had that also... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not a devotee of the Lord. So anyone... That is our criterion. Anyone who is not a devotee, whatever he may be... He may be very, very big or so-called saintly, but according to the description of the <span class="Italic">śāstras, na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> We shall calculate in that way. As soon as we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> He was devotee of Lord Śiva. Otherwise why Lord Śiva gives him whatever he wants?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Śiva is Lord Śiva. He is very powerful demigod. He can give. He has got the power. But in spite of being favored by Lord Śiva, in spite of his becoming the great devotee of Lord Śiva, why he is described as <span class="Italic">rākṣasa?</span> That is the point. So therefore if I say Rāvaṇa a <span class="Italic">rākṣasa,</span> according to the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> another devotee may be angry. So what can I do? It is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra, rākṣasa.</span> Similarly, in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is stated that <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ:</span> "If one is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa he is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina,</span> the most sinful, <span class="Italic">mūḍhā,</span> rascal, <span class="Italic">naradhāma,</span> lowest of the mankind, <span class="Italic">māyayā apahṛta-jñāna.</span>" These things are there. But if we quote the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that "This man has not surrendered to the Supreme Lord; therefore he is a rascal," then what is wrong with us? It may be very strong words, but it is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Just like about Rāvaṇa, it is stated that he is a <span class="Italic">rākṣasa.</span> So it may be very insulting and strong words, but this is the statement of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And if one quotes from the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> what is wrong on his part? Suppose in the court a big man has done something criminal, and the judgement is that he should be punished. So can you accuse the court, "Oh, such a big man?" Just like... For the time being let us understand. Mahatma Gandhi was put to jail in so many times. So nobody could say because according to law there was civil disobedience. So if the law puts you in the jail, so can you protest against that? Then you will be also put into jail, contempt of court. Although everyone respects Mahatma Gandhi, but why he was put into jail? According to law. It may be it is man-made law, it is wrong, but the principle is that whatever is judgement of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> we have to take. It doesn't matter who is that man and how great he is. That is... <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na siddhim sa...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is given stress always. So you cannot go beyond the verdict of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is the injunction. [break] ...about Guru Nanak's statement that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Rāma gao rāvaṇa gao.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You just explain that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as he said that, he was killed immediately. That is the atheistic version. "I don't care for God," So as soon as he became atheistic, he was killed, and so long he was chanting, "Rāma will kill me, Rāma will kill me," so he was not killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> He was a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> at that time according to the... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was chanting the holy name of Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> He was chanting Rāma, Rāma, Rāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">...yogino 'nante satyānande cid-ātmani, iti rāma-padenāsau paraṁ brahma ity abhidhīyate.</span> So so long one chants Rāma Kṛṣṇa, who can kill him? Yes. That is the point. [break] When he constructed bridge on the ocean, the stones were floating. Where is the law of gravitation go on? So He can do that. He withdrew the law of gravitation. [break] ...position of the demons. Although he is not learned, he will give instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> [break] ...who is learned. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...business, that without being learned in the subject matter he wants to give instruction. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Sir, let us now make arrangements to kill all children who were born within the last ten days in towns, countries, villages and pasturing grounds." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On this side there is government sign, "No dogs," "No dogs." Dogs are not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dogs are disturbing to the people. They can attack any man. If one takes dog, he must lash it, chain. That is the law there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> There is no idea also. When master is there, then he can control the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, the master is... He may be master of the dog, but he is not master of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But that is how he did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is quite all right, but after all, it is dog. After all, it is dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> And the law also is that it should be chained. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...sometimes dog attacks the master. Not only dog, animals. [break] ...the bitterest enemies of the demons, always. That is the position. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-bhakto bhaved daiva āsuras tad-viparyayaḥ.</span> So demigods, they are devotees of Viṣṇu, and they are always enemies unto the demons. [break] ...especially in the heart of the saintly person, to kill the saintly person. So Kṛṣṇa also will be killed. Because Kṛṣṇa is in everyone's heart, therefore everyone is Kṛṣṇa. The same conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> That does not show any logic, because He is in everybody's heart, how can anyone be Kṛṣṇa? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is in the heart of a dog also. Then dog is also Kṛṣṇa. So why one should go to the temple? He can worship his dog at home. If this logic is all right. [break] ...the verdict of the Rāmakrishna mission, "You can worship whatever you like. That is God." And therefore they have manufactured this word, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">Jāta-karma-saṁskāra, saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ. Saṁskāra,</span> reformatory method, begins before the birth. Before the birth, when the father and mother have sex, that is called <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.</span> That is also another ceremony. It is not a hidden fact. So <span class="Italic">saṁskārad bhaved dvijaḥ.</span> Otherwise it is birth like cats and dogs. That is Vedic civlization, <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> before the birth and immediately after the birth, then one after another. This is called <span class="Italic">jata-karma;</span> then <span class="Italic">nāma-karma;</span> then when he is grown boy, <span class="Italic">upanayana-saṁskāra, dīkṣā-saṁskāra;</span> then when he is grown up and marriage... Marriage is also another <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> In this way there are <span class="Italic">daśa-vidha-saṁskāra.</span> So unless one goes through all the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras,</span> he is not accepted as higher caste. He is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> In a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, if the <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra</span> is not taken, so it is said that immediately the whole family becomes <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> no more <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Then where is <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra</span> is going on? Nobody takes care of <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra.</span> Still, they are declaring that "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" Therefore the conclusion is <span class="Italic">kālau śūdra-sambhavaḥ:</span> "Everyone is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span>" [break] ...no education. Still, one is called <span class="Italic">paṇḍitji.</span> What is the meaning of this <span class="Italic">"paṇḍitji?"</span> If he is not learned, then why do you call him <span class="Italic">paṇḍitji?</span> (laughing) [break] That <span class="Italic">paṇḍiya</span> is also another form of <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. From <span class="Italic">paṇḍiya, paṇḍiya.</span> From <span class="Italic">paṇḍitya,</span> from <span class="Italic">paṇḍitya,</span> it comes <span class="Italic">paṇḍiya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> He is not a <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> He is a <span class="Italic">pukka</span> businessman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mean, I say this is going on. But <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says if one is engaged in a particular type of occupation, he should be called that. <span class="Italic">Yasya hi yal-lakṣaṇaṁ proktaṁ varṇābhivyañ-jakam.</span> To designate into certain type of <span class="Italic">varṇa,</span> there are symptoms.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> According to the work it is known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Even a man is born in the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, but if he is working as something else, so he should be... Practically also... Just like somebody is <span class="Italic">paṇḍita, brāhmaṇa,</span> but if he is doing the work of an engineer or doctor, he is addressed as "Doctor Saheb." That is practical. "Doctor Saheb. Engineer Saheb." Not "Paṇḍitji."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Provided he has got the particular <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> (Hindi) That is the beginning of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that is the beginning of <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> There is regular ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> But a very few people nowadays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still in Bengal, when the husband meets first the wife, there is <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> There is regular <span class="Italic">pūjā, patha.</span> Then the husband and wife meet together.

The family members take baths, cleanse themselves, and decorate themselves with ornaments and garlands. Then they come before the child and the astrologer to hear the future life of the child. Nanda Mahārāja and other members of the family dressed and sat down in front of the birthplace. All the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> who were assembled there on this occasion chanted auspicious <span class="Italic">mantras.</span>" [break]</div>

So he distributed fifty percent to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and Vaiṣṇava and twenty-five percent he gave to the relatives, and twenty-five percent he kept for his personal emergency.

Although they were village men, they were very rich. That is the old Vedic civilization. Now you go to the village-all poor. The cows are skinny, people have no home, no nice cloth. This is the position. And we are still advanced, advanced. They are proud of "advanced." And here is the... Just hear the description of the village, with cows only. So how much fallen we have become, we can just imagine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, in New Delhi the government has banned the use of milk in the sweet shops and there is no more cheese or any milk products.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And there will be no more. These things will vanish. That is stated in the... Rice, wheat, milk, sugar and fruits, they will be no more available. You have to eat meat. That day is coming. But before that day comes, you go back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. You simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa and everything is finished, all this nonsense place, full of demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> "They possessed such an abundance of various kinds of milk products that they were throwing butter lavishly on each other's body without restriction."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how rich they were.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So much butter and all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Throwing butter like anything. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Now we can see also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> "Their wealth was in milk, yogurt, clarified butter and many other milk products. And by trading their agricultural products, they were rich in various kinds of jewelry, ornaments and costly dresses." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...even the richest man, their wife has no bangles. You see? And they are jewelries. Jewelries. Cow, butter, throwing butter like anything, and silk sari and enough food grains. What is more want for material advancement? That is real material ad... You have got everything, material needs. [break] If a man can feed his wife and children, then he is successful. There is no question of charity. There is no question of charity. But here it is said they were also giving in charity. [break] ...stopped to become real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and give instruction to the society, and they also stopped giving charity to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> So therefore the society is so fallen. There is no instruction from the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and no charity from the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...proṣita bhārtṛkā.</span> By the dress a woman is recognized. When she does not dress very nicely, it is to be understood that her husband is out of home. When there is the vermillion, that means she is married. When the, what is called, division? <span class="Italic">Siti. Siti</span> is in this side, then she is prostitute. The dress, when the woman dresses with white dress, they are widow, no husband. Yes, in this way by dress...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. You can recognize here. But now they are changed completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When the girl has no this covering, that means she is virgin. She is not married. In this way all the signs are there. This is <span class="Italic">prosita bhartrka. Prosita-bhartrka</span> means one whose husband is not at home, outside. Then she will not dress, she will not take regular bath, so that people may know that her husband is not at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> She won't take bath?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not, take bath not with any oil. Yes. Means she wanted to avoid very good looking. Yes, that is the idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> "But although Rohiṇī's husband was away, she still dressed herself on this occasion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...deliver each and every child to Kamsa, but in the case of Kṛṣṇa he did not do so. He did not deliver. He cheated him by changing. So to give protection to Kṛṣṇa, they had to do something, even it is not sanctioned. He violated because he promised before Kaṁsa that "I shall deliver all the children," and he did it. But when there was Kṛṣṇa, he broke the promise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> "Vasudeva continued, 'My dear friend it is very difficult...' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Vasudeva is very jubilant that Kṛṣṇa is now alive and His birthday ceremony has been performed. Therefore he is so pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> "Vasudeva continued, 'My dear friend, it is very difficult for us to live together.' " [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cows were getting grass also. Water. But you will find there is no water, there is no grass in the field. And the government is sending the cows to the slaughterhouse. This is the condition of present India. In Europe, America, although they are selling the cows to the slaughterhouse, they have got enough grass and water. That I have seen. At least so long they live, the cows are comfortably maintained. But here there is no comfort for the cows. Now here the anxiety is whether the cows are getting sufficient grass and water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlal:</span> What's the explanation then? They are slaughtering more cows in the United States, but there is still more fortunate situation there materially.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is now dwindling. The hippies are coming out. So one day it will be finished. One day it will be finished. That... It has already begun. The future hope is now becoming hippies. So who will manage this? It is already there is a problem how to maintain the industry, how to... This has become a problem. So naturally, when the, there will be all hippies, not to work, then everything collapses. The so-called prosperity will be finished. [break] Nobody is working sincerely. Here also in India, all government servants, they do not work. The manager of the government coal company said that "The workers in the mine, they are not working. Therefore we have to increase the price." So now, everything dependent on one another, so if one side there is noncooperation, the whole thing will collapse. [break] ...college they don't work. One thing is that draft board chasing all young men. (end)</div>
