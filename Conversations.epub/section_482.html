<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kanti:</span> Morning walk conversation, at Marina del Rey. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... New Vrindaban? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> When would you like to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you are going to Dallas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Dallas? On Tuesday morning, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (inaudible) We were planning that you would stay there for two days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And then we're going to New Vrindaban on Thursday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (inaudible due to loud ocean waves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We'll be leaving on the 16th. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Delhi also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (inaudible) They have come from otherwise?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Probably the man who brought them out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The man who brought them out to play with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the beach dogs are not allowed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> No. Many times men bring their dogs out to play on the beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...if one successful yogi can walk on the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any process in the science? No. Then? That is called <span class="Italic">laghimā. Laghimā-siddhi. Laghimā-siddhi,</span> you become so light that you can walk on the water, you can fly in the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> There was one yogi who advertised just recently that he was going to walk on the water. And he sold tickets. So all the people came to see him walk on the water. Then when he got on the water he went straight down. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It was in the West I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, there was one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> There was an article in the Los Angeles paper yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, in India also, about ten years ago, there was one... India. In Bombay. But he didn't, he couldn't walk. But it was sold. The tickets was about five hundred rupees or so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But a... Big, big people were invited and actually he didn't walk. He fell down in the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Maybe Kṛṣṇa took his power away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He was almost beaten. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He said he missed something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many birds are floating on the sea. Nobody's interested. But one rascal will advertise that "I can walk." They purchase five hundred rupees ticket. (laughter) (pause) People want to see magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if somebody can show magic, then he becomes God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> God is showing so much magic but people don't recognize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is also magic. But the scientists will say, "Water is combination of this chemical, that chemical." And wherefrom so much chemical came? That is a magic. But that magic he'll not see. Eh? Dr...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That magic, they will say it was produced by nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, it is magic for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, but they don't say it is magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is magic for him because he cannot produce so much water. In the laboratory he can produce water just to fill up a test tube. But wherefrom this water came? That is magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is so much beyond their concept that they just, they just don't want to think about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means, that is animal propensity. The same thing, example. As a rabbit is going to be killed, he closes the eyes. "There is no danger. (laughter) There is no danger." He's thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, there are thousand things they are taking for granted without...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not science. Science should not take anything granted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Something which is beyond their experimental knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the difference between the scientists and the devotees? The devotees, devotee accepts what Kṛṣṇa says. That's all. Granted. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) In the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">acintyā khalu ye bhāvā na tās tarkeṇa yojayet, yojayet.</span> "Things which are beyond your conception or perception, don't bring it in arguments and logic."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is from <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu? Acintyā khalu ye bhāvā...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If they think a little carefully. Then there is no reason why they can't accept Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to do, to convince them that "You think little carefully. You are advertising yourself as scientist, but you are talking without any care." (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have statistical data about the creation of the material universe, the material world. For example, like in a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, yes. Four <span class="Italic">yugas,</span> the four <span class="Italic">yugas</span> comprise four million, three hundred thousand years. The <span class="Italic">yugas</span> together, four. The...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-three hundred thousands of years, four <span class="Italic">yugas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, four million, three hundred twenty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, four <span class="Italic">yugas.</span> Do you mean to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Altogether.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All <span class="Italic">yugas,</span> Satya, Treta, Dvapara, Kali, the total years are forty-three hundred thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. The calculations by the biologists for the beginning of life, they say it is about four billion years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> About four billion years ago, the small species like unicellular species like the bacteria and these started about four billions years ago. And the human life started...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, where started? Bacteria?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. In the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the earth was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, before that earth was formed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When, they say, the earth, first the earth was formed, and after that, it took some time to make some living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, but how the earth came into existence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have several theories about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only one earth, but there are so many. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They speculate that at the most the human form of life started about five thousand, about fifty thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's what they think. From similar type of species like human beings, started about fifty thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, there's just new findings. Three millions years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, that's about the... It's not the whole...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There's all forms of species developing slowly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No. Now they have just recently found a species of man three millions years ago, and it's similar to modern man. So scientists... So now they have concluded that there are more than one species, a lower species and a higher species existing at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Darwin is a rascal. He cannot... He has taken some idea from this <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa,</span> and he has developed in a befooling way. There are different types of human beings, four hundred thousand species. (pause) [break] ...is to conquer over the stringent laws of nature. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No? What is the purpose of scientific research?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To conquer over the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not? The laws of nature is already powerful. So you have not conquered over the laws of nature. Then how science is powerful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> You cannot conquer the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Science cannot conquer the laws of nature. That is why they try to think only about the body, the bodily concept. To give them comfort to the body by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense gratification. That's all. Everything ending in sense gratification. That's all. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's like it is a fashion to try to violate the laws of nature. It is becoming very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is childish. That a child says, "No, no." Mother says, "Sit down." "No, no." (laughter) One! "Ahhhh." (laughter) Mother is the nature, and child is trying to violate the orders of mother. This is the position. So who will take them very seriously?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That's why they suffer the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suffer is suffered(?). <span class="Italic">Tayā sammohito jīva ātmānam tri-guṇātmakam. Yayā sammohito...</span> There is a verse. <span class="Italic">Yaya sammohito jīva ātmanam tri-guṇātmakam, manute anartham... [SB </span>1.7.5].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The car is this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? <span class="Italic">Harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The result of this violation of the laws of nature is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot violate. That is not possible. There is no question of violating. Simply childish attempt. That's all. You cannot violate it. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are... They are planning to make a... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is childish. That is childish. "They are planning." That is childish. Although they are being repeatedly baffled, still trying. This is childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have already timetable worked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That in two thousand years they are going to make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that he'll not live for two thousand years. Then the bluff cannot be shown. Violation is not possible, sir. That is not possible. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> You are trying to violate, but here are the four principles. It is not possible. You cannot violate. There is death; you cannot violate this. As soon as the time will come, you must die. Finished, all your scientific research. Four millions, trillions, and you can say, at that time there was no civilized man. At that time man was dying and animal was dying. And at this time man is dying and animal is dying. So what improvement you have made? There is no improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This is also called tampering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Tampering with the machinery of God. They try to manipulate in a different way so that they can get some deviation from the normal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no deviation. (Śrīla Prabhupāda apparently gets into car.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
