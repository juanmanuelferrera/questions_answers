<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">. Paśyanti,</span> this word is there. <span class="Italic">Yoginaḥ paśyanti</span> they see. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita,</span> by meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> This is the Sixth Chapter <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Is that what you're quoting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I see. But that seeing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That seeing is not <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Seeing is <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> undoubtedly, but seeing and talking and becoming friend, that is higher. Friend or conjugal lover, father, mother. That kind of seeing is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If that yogi quits his body in that condition, does he attain a Vaikuṇṭha planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> [break] Is it possible that if he was... This is a question that sometimes a devotee has asked me. If a yogi does attain a Vaikuṇṭha planet, but by his constitutional nature he is meant to be associated with Kṛṣṇa in Goloka...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not with Viṣṇu. Vaikuṇṭha is Viṣṇu, Nārāyaṇa. That is also... But there Nārāyaṇa is worshiped with awe and veneration. He is God. No friendship as in Vṛndāvana. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Vipralambha-sakhya. Aiśvarya, aiśvarya,</span> opulence. There the Supreme Lord is taken in <span class="Italic">aiśvarya,</span> opulences. Not <span class="Italic">aiśvarya-sthiti.</span> In Vṛndāvana the devotees, they practically do not know that Kṛṣṇa is God. "He is our very beloved friend." That's all. They doesn't care to know whether He is God or not. Here the conception of God. Vaikuṇṭha, "Oh, here is God," with awe and veneration, respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That I understand. The question is suppose this yogi, he has not got full knowledge, he does not know of Kṛṣṇa, and therefore he is meditating on Paramātmā, and he attains Vaikuṇṭha. Is it possible that because he hadn't got full knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has to go, simply by Paramātmā conception, he cannot go to Vaikuṇṭha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Can he later go on from Vaikuṇṭha to Goloka? Can that happen also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is such instances, can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But if a devotee knows Kṛṣṇa, if he knows of Kṛṣṇa, then wherever he is destined, he will go perfectly to his perfect position. Just like Bhīṣma knew Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-yājino yānti mām.</span> Kṛṣṇa devotees, they go directly, especially those who are worshiping Kṛṣṇa through Caitanya Mahāprabhu. They directly go to Kṛṣṇaloka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> What about like the case of Bhīṣmadeva where he knew about Kṛṣṇa in Goloka, and he went to Kṛṣṇa as <span class="Italic">Pārtha-sārathi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa... He understood Kṛṣṇa as Nārāyaṇa. He will go to Vaikuṇṭha, Bhīṣmadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But he had full knowledge of everything as a <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> He knew also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he loved Nārāyaṇa, <span class="Italic">Catur-bhuja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, that was his constitutional position. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like sometimes <span class="Italic">mādhurya-rasa</span> is the greatest humor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mādhurya-rasa,</span> conjugal love. But still, there are devotees who prefer parental love, friendly love. That is liking. Everyone has got his own liking. But they are all the same, all the same. There is no difference between Kṛṣṇa devotee and Nārāyaṇa devotee. They are all the... But it is their liking, varieties of liking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Another related question that also arose... These come in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> class with the devotees because they think about the questions and sometimes they come up with nice ones. When Kṛṣṇa is incarnating in His plenary incarnations like Varāha, Nṛsiṁha, like that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. And sometimes devotees become devoted to those forms. Are there corresponding planets in Vaikuṇṭha for those forms of incarnation? Is there a planet of Nṛsiṁha or Nṛsiṁha-loka in the Vaikuṇṭha sphere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far (I) know, those planets are here within this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Wherever He is appearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Even Rāmacandra's. So far I have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> On all the Vaikuṇṭhas, Kṛṣṇa is in His <span class="Italic">catur-bhuja,</span> four-armed form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But those devotees will eventually go there. Those kind of devotees like devotees of Sītā-Rāma, they will also attain the spiritual sky in their various positions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> All right. Thank you very much. (offers obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jānakī:</span> One is rice and the other <span class="Italic">baḍā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jānakī:</span> Milk, hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jānakī:</span> I think that other thing was not a good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was too cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jānakī:</span> Yes, it reduces heat. I will bring some hot pepper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...is taking place. The rascal Darwin says that it is coming from monkey. Why the monkey does not produce a human being? All rascals. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> Simply rascals. His name is Neiman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Couldn't get his last, Ruby something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ruby, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He is a very nice gentleman. He appreciated <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He said right away, very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> My wife's typing up all your lectures. She has finished L.A. lectures. Now she is typing Māyāpura lectures, this lecture, that lecture. She has permanent machine and typewriter and apartment. So she types all during the day and she minds the child. And then it is in the same apartment.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Typing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now this house will facilitate our business. Just opposite the temple. So round about. Therefore I asked him, "Purchase these houses, purchase." Never mind. So that is not lost. They were paying rent elsewhere. They can pay here. We get our permanent tenants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes. All children live there too. It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these houses. Now we have got four or five houses. Two houses of the Bhaktivedanta Book Trust and three houses of M.V. Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> It will be a city. It's so nice, all the children live there together. Next door there is Baladeva, that little boy with red hair. Aniruddha, he is blond hair and another boy with red hair, he is next door. He is best friend. They always play, all boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. And in the front house, there is ample space back there for children's play. This will facilitate... Very nice. And then one house after, there is another house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, up on the street, on our side of street.</div>

(laughs) After purchasing these houses. Here also, we can have very nice colony, in this village. There are so many land, houses are for sale. If we can organize. Now you utilize these lands for growing fruit, flower, anything, whatever you can grow. But utilize this land. It doesn't matter what you would grow, anything. Who will be in charge?</div>
