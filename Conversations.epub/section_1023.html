<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are so... You can keep it there now. Keep. So you do not believe in these things, that there is Bhagavān and Bhagavān comes, He has got a mission. Do you believe in these things? Frankly speaking, do you believe in these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> We do. We do believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you must act according to His mission. According to His mission. The mission is <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When we are engaged in <span class="Italic">glānir dharma,</span> which is not <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Cheating. <span class="Italic">Glānir, glānir.</span> What is the <span class="Italic">glānir? Glānir</span> means which is abominable. Yes. <span class="Italic">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So what is that <span class="Italic">glānir? Glānir</span> means, <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> there is... Yamarāja said, <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">. Dharma</span> cannot be manufactured by any man. You have got Sixth Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Sixth Canto, Third Chapter, 19th verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, find this verse. Yamarāja said, <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even the demigods, they cannot manufacture <span class="Italic">dharma</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>na vai vidur ṛṣayo nāpi devāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>na siddha-mukhyā asurā manuṣyāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kuto nu vidyādhara-cāraṇādayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.3.19]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Real religious principles are enacted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although fully situated in the mode of goodness, even the great ṛṣis who occupy the topmost planets cannot ascertain the real religious principles, nor can the demigods or the leaders of Siddhaloka, to say nothing of the asuras, ordinary human beings, Vidyādharas and Cāraṇas."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can. This is the principle. So when so many rascal <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is introduced, that is <span class="Italic">dharmasya glāniḥ.</span> So we must know this. Then we can understand what is the mission of Bhagavān. When rascals are introducing so-called so many <span class="Italic">dharmas,</span> that is <span class="Italic">dharmasya glāniḥ.</span> Do you accept or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Yes, we accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, Bhagavān concludes at the end, "You rascal, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span>" This is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> To surrender to the Lord. That is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> In another place, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> Without this, all cheating. If there is no <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> surrender to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, all these kind of <span class="Italic">dharmas,</span> they're all cheating. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> it is said <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> On this, Śrīdhara Svāmī has commented, <span class="Italic">atra mokṣa vañca api nirastam.(?) Dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90].</span> So according to this principle, they're all cheating. So-called religious system, <span class="Italic">artha,</span> economic development, sense gratification. Just like that, we have created so many social <span class="Italic">dharmas. Saṁsāra-dharma, gṛhastha-dharma,</span> this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> that <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> So in that way, they're all-cheating. Therefore, our request is that <span class="Italic">yajñārthe karmaṇaḥ anyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> In the Bālajī's temple, mostly poor cultivators. I have seen, they go. And they want to give something to the Lord. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe.</span> So the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they're advised, <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi kuruṣva tad mad arpaṇam.</span> "Give me." So these <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> somehow or other, by their great fortune, they're giving something to the Lord. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe.</span> That money should not be utilized for any other purpose. That is our message. It must be utilized for the purpose to fulfill the mission of the Lord. Mission of the Lord is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> How people can be trained up to give up all these nonsensical type of <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> and how to become a devotee of Lord. For this purpose this money should be spent. Then it will be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Mostly it is utilized for that. Almost completely. Only one or two is mere what is called charity. The industry, there's been a wrong impression that we are working directly with industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is... It should be utilized simply for the purpose of awakening the devotional, what is called-inspiration. For no other purpose. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> it is said <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-bhakti. Kṛṣṇa-bhakti, nitya-siddha.</span> This is our natural... Just like these Europeans and Americans, they have become Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhaktas.</span> So what business they had to do with Kṛṣṇa? They're coming from Christian family, Jewish families, or some of them Mohammedan family. So what they have got to do with Kṛṣṇa? They haven't got to do anything with Kṛṣṇa. So how they have become a Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta?</span> Even the... Just like he is coming from Parsee family, he is coming from Jewish family, he is coming from Christian family, he is coming from Europe, he is coming from America. So what they have got to do with Kṛṣṇa? We Indians or Hindus, we may have some concern with Kṛṣṇa, but what they have got? They haven't got anything to do with Kṛṣṇa. Now you pay them one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees and ask them, "You become again Christian. You become again Parsee." Just see. Make them again Christian. Practical. These are young boys. You ask them, that "I'll give you good girl, I'll give you good money. You give up this Kṛṣṇa consciousness-come here." Ask them, make a test. They'll refuse, they'll kick out. How they have become? Therefore it is a fact, as it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta, kṛṣṇa-bhakti nitya-siddha.</span> Everyone has got Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> eternally. It is not artificial. They have not become Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> artificially. It is the eternal link that has been awakened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> There's no doubt of that, Swamiji. Let us say there are hundred leprosy patients. There are one thousand orphans. We put them there, give them food, and make them pray to Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, you are... They are mistaken. But if you have to awaken Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> why you go to the lepers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> No, they have come here. They are all there in the temple. They are not allowing others to pray properly. They are all, one thousand... In the past...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no objection, because our principle is <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti nitya-siddha.</span> So Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is there in everyone. So leper and non-leper. Just like our Vivekananda, he took up <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> This is an absurd proposition. Nārāyaṇa is never <span class="Italic">daridra.</span> But if you put this argument, that Nārāyaṇa is everywhere, so if Nārāyaṇa is everywhere, why you take up only <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa?</span> Why not <span class="Italic">dhanī-nārāyaṇa</span> also? If you have got so broad vision that Nārāyaṇa is everywhere, therefore we see everyone, so why you particularly take the <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa?</span> Similarly, Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is everywhere. It is in the leper or non-leper. So why should we take particularly the lepers? So that is outwardly a social service that they are taking care of the leper. So if that vision it will not be right. Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> even requires, even a <span class="Italic">karmī</span> like big, big owner of factories, he's more diseased than the leper. Because he has no Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So we have to take care of the leper and the richest man also if he has no Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> That also. That also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore we should not make any distinction that only the lepers will be taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> (Hindi) a rich man or somebody comes, prays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is more than leper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> He takes <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> in the temple, he goes. But this man is not allowed. He can't come. Therefore God goes to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to take... You cannot manufacture where God goes. You should have to take lesson from God. That is one thing. If we manufacture ideas, that will never be successful. That will never be successful. Don't manufacture ideas. If you want to be servant of God, you must take instruction from God. That is wanted. You cannot manufacture idea that "God wants this." So first of all try to understand what is God's mission. God's mission is, it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So, more or less, everyone is entangled with this <span class="Italic">glānir dharma.</span> They have manufactured. Just like the demigod worship. This is a <span class="Italic">glānir dharma.</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> And Kṛṣṇa clearly says <span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante anya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you want to utilize, people are giving in good faith, Bālajī, Kṛṣṇa. Their hard-earned money, whatever we are giving something. <span class="Italic">Yajña,</span> that is wanted. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> That money should not be utilized for any other purpose except <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> First of all, you have to decide like that. Then we can give you direction. First of all, you have to decide that this money, not a single farthing should be spent for any other purpose than performing <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Then we can give you right direction. And if you have plan to utilize this money for any other purpose, that is not Kṛṣṇa's mission. That is your mission. So first of all you have to decide whether you are going to execute Kṛṣṇa's mission or your mission. Kṛṣṇa's mission is very clearly defined. It is there, everything is declared there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We can do it very nicely. But if you want to do any other mission, then you can do. You are government, you are in power, you can do that. But that will not be pleasing to Kṛṣṇa. He has got a mission. That is stated. <span class="Italic">Dharmasya glānir bhavati.</span> So any <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> so-called <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> which does not awaken their Kṛṣṇa consciousness is <span class="Italic">glāniḥ.</span> Kṛṣṇa does not want that. If you're against the will of Kṛṣṇa, against the mission of Kṛṣṇa, if you want to do something, you can do. People are doing so many things. That is also mentioned by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Iti te jñānam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That one verse is that one does not... Kṛṣṇa's mission is that "Surrender unto Me." Now who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa? That is stated by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyone who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, he must be grouped either <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna, āsuraṁ bhāvam.</span> We do that. Anyone who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa, he must be grouped among them. And for them, what is their... <span class="Italic">Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān kṣipāmy ajasram.</span> Find out this verse, <span class="Italic">tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān...</span> If anyone is envious of Kṛṣṇa, then what is his punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān<br class="calibre2"/>saṁsāreṣu narādhamān<br class="calibre2"/>kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān<br class="calibre2"/>āsurīṣv eva yoniṣu<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Those who are envious and mischievous, who are the lowest among men, are cast by Me into the ocean of material existence into various demoniac species of life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And next verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">āsurīṁ yonim āpannā<br class="calibre2"/>mūḍhā janmani janmani<br class="calibre2"/>mām aprāpyaiva kaunteya<br class="calibre2"/>tato yānty adhamāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 16.20]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Attaining repeated birth amongst the species of demoniac life, such persons can never approach Me. Gradually they sink down to the most abominable type of existence."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is my request, that our money... There is nothing our money. Everything Kṛṣṇa's. But we are thinking. Because we are asuric. So <span class="Italic">asuras</span> think like that. Just like Kaṁsa, Hiraṇyakaśipu. "Ha!" Rāvaṇa. "Ha! What is Rāma?" That is <span class="Italic">asura's.</span> They think like that, and that is asuric. But otherwise <span class="Italic">īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Therefore <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is advised. The sooner you hand over Kṛṣṇa's property to Kṛṣṇa, it is good for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Swamiji we are <span class="Italic">karmī-yogīs.</span> We start the day with surrendering to God and asking Him to show us the way. Beyond that, I don't know what our duty...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But a <span class="Italic">karma-yogī,</span> why you should take Kṛṣṇa's money for <span class="Italic">karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> For what? (indistinct) That is for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> It is not used. As you have correctly said, that way only it is used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the first thing is that if you decide that Kṛṣṇa's money should be utilized for Kṛṣṇa's mission, so Kṛṣṇa's mission is this, that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have to bring them to the sense of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And there is a process. You cannot manufacture that process. You have to take the process from Kṛṣṇa. That Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Four things. You have to teach people how he can think of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> Then the mission is there. That is Kṛṣṇa also. Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>namasyantaś ca māṁ bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>nitya-yuktā upāsate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">You have to teach them like that. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām.</span> As we are doing. We're always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. But if you manufacture in your own way, that you can do. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ na sa siddhim avāpnoti</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> That will never be successful. If you have to execute the mission of Kṛṣṇa, you have to take instruction of Kṛṣṇa and do it rigidly. Then you'll be successful. Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa's mission is that one must know Kṛṣṇa and surrender to Him. This is mission. Kṛṣṇa does not say that by <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> one can understand Him. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot say "We are <span class="Italic">karma-yogīs.</span>" <span class="Italic">Karma-yogī</span> means the third-class. He's <span class="Italic">karmī</span> and little mixed up with <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Adulterated. <span class="Italic">Jñāna-yogī,</span> he's not a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> He's <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> but just to bring him gradually, a little <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> You see? And real <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> When it will be tintless of any <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> then it is pure <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's mission. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not mixed up with <span class="Italic">jñāna, karma,</span> yoga. Otherwise, how Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> He could have said, "Any way," as these rascals say, "Any way go, you will get Kṛṣṇa." That Kṛṣṇa does not say. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">. Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ [Bg. 7.3]. Janma karma me divyaṁ yo jānāti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that <span class="Italic">tattva, bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we have to take this. You manufacture in your own way, and still you carry out the mission of Kṛṣṇa. That is contradiction. You have to take the lesson from Kṛṣṇa. Then it will be successful. <span class="Italic">Karma-yoga</span> is for the third-class. They are addicted to <span class="Italic">karma,</span> a little <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> that's all. That is not pure. <span class="Italic">Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> When there is not a tinge of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> that is pure <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's mission. So everything is there, direction is there. We can guide you, not according to our whims, but according to <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And if you agree to accept, then we can also cooperate with you. But if you manufacture your own way, then how we can possibly... Kṛṣṇa's mission is this: <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Except <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti, bhaktyā,</span> everything is <span class="Italic">glāniḥ.</span> All <span class="Italic">glāniḥ.</span> And that can be awakened, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti.</span> Just like these boys are doing. That is enunciated in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta-nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa</span>-everyone has <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti.</span> You have to awaken simply. <span class="Italic">Nitya-siddha kṛṣṇa-prema sādhya kabhu naya</span> [Cc. madhya 22.107]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is not artificial. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇādi-śuddha-citte karaye udaya.</span> If the hearing about Kṛṣṇa is pure... That is also confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>hṛdy antaḥ stho hy abhadrāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>vidhunoti suhṛt satām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.17]</div>

And government men, you can see that we are not touching a single farthing of your money, but it is being spent for Kṛṣṇa's mission. That you can believe. It is the duty of the government men to see that people may not misrepresent. That is the Vedic injunction. Pṛthu Mahārāja was to see that a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is doing, acting like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya</span> is doing like <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So it is government's duty to see that Bālajī's money, Kṛṣṇa's money, is to the farthing spent for His mission. That is your duty. That is government's duty, that nothing is misused, nothing is misrepresented. But we know how to execute the mission of Kṛṣṇa. Anyone can know because direction is there. It is not a secret thing. It is open secret. But you have to act upon it. That requires training. And so far my experience goes, the whole world will take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Unfortunately, I am struggling single-handed. And they are criticizing me in the Parliament. You have seen the recent article Blitz against me? What is that heading? "Ungodly face." I am doing ungodly? But they are advertising like that. Trying to make me unpopular. The Māyāvādīs, they say that Bhaktivedanta Swami is ruining Hinduism. They are saying like that. (Hindi) So I am being criticized in Parliament, I am criticized by the so-called <span class="Italic">jagad-gurus</span> who have never seen what is <span class="Italic">jagat.</span> And so on, so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> No, for a country suffering from multiplicity of gods, Hinduism, you are doing a very great service, asking them to concentrate on Kṛṣṇa.</div>

They are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> with the purpose of killing Kṛṣṇa. Everyone. The politicians, the scholars, the rascals, and everyone. The main purpose is how to kill Kṛṣṇa. In Bombay I have got a very big friend, you know him. I do not wish to disclose his name. He has set aside ten <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees for preaching <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> But he wants <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> without Kṛṣṇa. Rāma without Sītā. Rāvaṇa's policy. Take away Sītā. Rāma will remain alone. So take away <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and cut Kṛṣṇa. But I cannot make any compromise I shall... My life is ended, now eighty-one. I do not... But so long I shall live I shall make no compromise, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">. Dṛḍha-vrata.</span> And that is a fact.

I am working night, writing these books, and these boys are helping me to sell it. I am getting enough money to spend it. What is my fault? For Kṛṣṇa's sake we have sacrificed everything, our life and everything and Kṛṣṇa is giving us money and we are spending it and they are criticizing in the Parliament. This is my misfortune. I don't take it as misfortune. Because <span class="Italic">asuras</span> are always there. Even Kṛṣṇa's time.</div>

Similarly, in Bombay we are spending every month seven <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> regularly. That is coming from foreign countries. And they are thinking that I'm taking bribe and acting as C.I.A. And C.I.A. have become Vaiṣṇavas with long <span class="Italic">śikhā</span> and giving up all facilities of life and they are dancing with the C.I.A. People have no common sense that C.I.A. agent could stay in a nice hotel and enjoy life. Why so much <span class="Italic">vairāgya?</span> Even my Godbrothers said that American government has given me two <span class="Italic">crores</span> of rupees. Now we are planning to have a temple in Māyāpura where... What is, what is the economic estimates, where we shall spend how much money monthly?</div>

With such nonsense knowledge, they are posted in big post. He does not know who is the author of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Here it is distinctly said, "I learned it from my father." So his father is Vyāsadeva. You take this verse. If anyone says... So Śukadeva Gosvāmī is the speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> he's admitting that "I've learned it from my father." And where the Bopadeva comes? Is that right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I was trying, that if I began to oppose him then he would not take the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Scholarly. Just present that here is the... Śukadeva Gosvāmī is the speaker of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> He says "I learned it from my father." And who is his father? Bopadeva or Vyāsadeva? This is going on. That is finished. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. Only two of them. One of them is here but he was not at home and the other one is out of station. So we'll get their signature when they come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two of them have signed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. Hariprasad and Shrinivas, they have both signed. And Shri Krishnan-dyuta, he's here but he was not at home or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll sign?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. He will do whatever Hariprasad, says and Omkar Lal is the youngest brother, so he will also sign. Shall I keep this or would you like to keep it here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you like. You can keep it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I'll lock it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that? (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhaviṣṇu:</span> When I speak to some of these archaeologists that I meet, these professors, I ask them do they believe in the historical validity of this <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> and they say, "Personally, I believe, but officially we have to follow the archaeology, the techniques of measuring the time." So they have two faces, one for official life and one for personal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Duplicity. Duplicity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhaviṣṇu:</span> Yes. But there are some of them that are trying to prove also that the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> was historical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> That very name suggests history. Bigger India. <span class="Italic">Mahā</span> means bigger, and <span class="Italic">Bhārata</span> means India. Where is Mahāṁsa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhaviṣṇu:</span> There is one verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> in Chapter Seven,</div>
<div class="Verse">icchā-dveṣa samutthena<br class="calibre2"/>dvandva-mohena bhārata<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-bhūtāni saṁmohaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarge yānti parantapa<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>7.27]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The meaning of this verse is that all living beings in the material world are born into delusion, overcome by the duality of desire and hate. So the fact is that the living entity, he desires to become great. Just like God is very great, so the living entity wants to imitate God, and therefore he comes in this material world, and he tries to become great and very powerful. This is desire. He tries to enjoy himself. And also <span class="Italic">icchā-dveṣa.</span> He becomes envious of the Lord. Many people in the material world, they don't like to admit that God exists or that there is someone greater than themselves because they think themselves to be the greatest. This is the disease of material life. But the cure for this disease that we have to accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know that? There are so many rascals, they say, "I'm God." You know that? That is the problem. If somebody says, "I am God," is it a fact? But he says like that. He's such a rascal. That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In spite of all falsehood, people accept him as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They accept.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the proof? Everyone can say, "I am God," but where is the proof? He must act like God. If somebody says, "I am the richest man," simply this statement will do, or we must see how he is rich? (pause) Hm. Give him.</div>
