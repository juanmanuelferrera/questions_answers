<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> They are willing to take so many material risks, but they are not willing to try spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is their fault. That is their foolishness. <i class="calibre3">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam</i>. Therefore, they are called <i class="calibre3">mūḍhās</i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> So how would we define the word "responsibility" in Krsna consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Responsibility is that you have got this human form of life, realize God, this is wanted. Otherwise you are finished. Three words. You have got this human form of life, your only responsibility is to understand God. This is your responsibility. That is Vedic culture. For understanding God, many, many kings, many, many saints, they left everything and went to the forest to realize God. That is Vedic culture. Bharata Mahārāja, under whose name India is called Bhāratavarṣa, he was the emperor of this planet, and at the age of twenty-four years he left everything to realize God. This is Vedic culture. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His position was very, very nice as a <i class="calibre3">gṛhastha</i>. A nice beautiful wife, affectionate mother, good influence, <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> family, learned scholar-everything first class. He left everything, just to show us. He was God Himself, but to set the example, <i class="calibre3">tyaktvā su-dustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīm</i> [SB 11.5.34], He gave up a kingdom, a fortune, which is aspired by the demigods. Such a nice life, such a nice family, (indistinct). <i class="calibre3">Tyaktvā su-dustyaja-surepsita-rājya-lakṣmīṁ dharmiṣṭha ārya</i> [SB 11.5.34], just to teach us the process of realizing God. This is Vedic culture. Be careful, somebody may not (indistinct). There is enough water? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm? Very deep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Not so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> When you asked me, what is that, definition of responsibility? Do you understand what is your responsibility?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> We have this human life, we must realize God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> These three words. Let the rascals understand this. We speak the whole responsibility in three words. Is it complete or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have got any further....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Let Śrīla Prabhupāda go through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> They have not taken God realization as a responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is their misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: Simply as a pastime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is their ignorance. They do not know what is responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: They would say that so many have taken God realization as a responsibility following some Christian church or something like that, but they are also frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We are not frustrated. We are not frustrated. Are you frustrated? (laughter) How the rascal says frustrated? If you take false thing, then you will be frustrated. If you take real path of God realization, there is no question of frustration. It is <i class="calibre3">ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam,</i> increasing pleasure. No frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: But they'd say that no one has real information of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have no, rascal, because you are rascal. I have got. You just wash my feet and I will inform you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotees: </b><i class="calibre3">Jaya!  Haribol!</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda: </b>You do not know how to swim, that does not mean I do not know. Is it a very honest statement? "Nobody can swim because he does not know." But if anyone knows how to swim, then why do you say that no one has done? You do not know, you accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3)</b>: Everyone thinks in terms of their own relative position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Even an insignificant bird, because he knows swimming, he knows swimming, so he can (indistinct). Because you do not know swimming, you cannot say like that. Even insignificant bird, just see how nicely he is swimming. He knows the art. Everyone, cent percent of the modern people, they do not believe in God and they do not know what is religion. That is the position. They think religion is sentiment, anyone can manufacture his own sentiment, there is no God. This is going on. So we are in fault. It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss. The whole world is under this conception; therefore we are at fault, we are preaching God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Generally they make it difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Generally they make it difficult for us to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> They hinder us in so many ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Because they have not realized that we have taken a responsibility. When a man has a responsibility, usually he is given some certain facilities to carry out that responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Everyone cent percent godless, neither they have got intelligence to understand what is God. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> Then we are giving them the intelligence as well as the answers? Because if they have no intelligence to understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, our organization is that. Why you are opening so many centers? Just to give these rascals intelligence. Why Krsna is recognizing so nicely a preacher? Because He knows that he has to face so many difficulties. It is not easy going. Armchair politician, no. He has to face so many difficulties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> Therefore, Krsna recognizes by giving knowledge of Himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Krsna immediately gives him all facilities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (3):</b> There has never been a movement like this which has given them factual knowledge of God. Therefore, they think it's sentiment, religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So we have to abide by their sentiment? Because they are rascals, we have to become rascal? Even if you take so-called responsibility, you will not be allowed to carry it out. The example I was giving., Napoleon, Hitler, and Gandhi, they took responsibility but they were driven away. What can you do? So what is the meaning of your responsibility? You will not be allowed to execute your responsibility. What remedy you have done that you will not be allowed, kicked out? Then what is your responsibility? Even if you are very nice gentleman, you have taken responsibility, but nature will not allow you to execute the responsibility. What is your answer to that? Big, big Napoleon, big, big Hitler, big, big Gandhi came and gone. Where is the responsibility executor? The Napoleon was given horse urine, you know, by the Britishers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (2):</b> To drink.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, at the last stage. When he was asking for water, they have given horse urine. He died like that. [break] Now he has gone to hell, America is there. Just see. Just see the position of regency. The Nixon, when he was in the office, oh, he was a big man, he was a responsible man. Now he is kicked out, he is begging, and America is going on. Where is the need of this responsibility? For several months he was asked that "You give up your responsibility." The rascal will not do. "No, without me, America will go to hell." Just see. This is responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> All of these big politicians, they seem to fall very ill afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> They seem to become very sick. Nixon is also ill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Not only sick, they die very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> Radhakrishnan was paralyzed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, brain paralyzed. (end)</div>
