<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...were caught, that "Here Rādhārāṇī was sleeping." [Break] ...and was talking about the name of God. So if we are chanting the name of God, what is your objection to accept the name of the Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> What's the objection to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Objection to accept the name which we are chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Was not that? What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, that God had no name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God had no name, then Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> His point was actually that God had no name, otherwise He would be a person. But I think you missed that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, I stressed that if God has no name, then why Christ said that "Hallowed be Thy name"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Well, he explained from his theologian point of view, when Moses was asking God, "Who is Thy name?" God didn't give a name but said only, "I am who I am." And then He explained if in the prayer one says, "Blessed be thy name," they use this in order to avoid a direct name. So just only say, "The name." But I don't understand the whole thing because the word God already is... What do you want more? And I believe that in the Christian religion, everybody just says God. They think the word God is the name and nothing more needed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not very good sense, that president, president of America. People say " 'President' is sufficient." Then why "Mr. Nixon"? They are all fools? No, they say, "Mr. Nixon," sometimes they say, and sometimes, "the President." Rather, they say more "Mr. Nixon" than "the President." Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Sure. But I only can say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this argument, this argument is not very sensible argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> No, but that is the answer they would give. I don't believe the special name of God is for me the name, the word God. We are praying to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No, no. Then name... When Christ says, "Hallowed by Thy name," there is name. The name is Kṛṣṇa, already there. Therefore he did not require to say again. But the name is there, Kṛṣṇa is there, Viṣṇu is there, Mādhava is there, Govinda is there. There are thousands and thousands of names. So you pick up any one of them. And chant it. Why do you say there is no name? Then we are chanting the name. Then what we are? We are all rascals and fools? If he says, "No, there is no name," Christ confirms there is name, and we are chanting the name. How you can say there is no name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes, quite. Well, I understand exactly what you mean very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is name. It is confirmed. "Hallowed be Thy name." Now, we are chanting the name. What is your objection? You chant this name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you... I mean to say anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes, quite, quite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And "Hallowed be Thy..." Those who are chanting the name of God, Kṛṣṇa, just see the result, whether they are improving or not than those who have no name. Come to the practical field. These boys and girls, before my coming in the western countries, they were all so many, I do not wish to... (laughing) Now by simply chanting the name, how much improvement they have done? So why there should be any objection to chant this name? And what is the loss there? Suppose anyone chants Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> There is no loss, but the gain is practical. Why do they not, these theosophists, do not agree to chant this name, simple thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> I think they don't know it, and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the fact. They don't know it. And still, they are theologicians. They are philosophers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know anything; still, they are teachers. That is the defect of the modern civilization, that one is not qualified man, and he is teacher. He has become a teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes, the theology is very much a collection of hardened, petrified interpretation of original experiences. And just because they are petrified very often, today theology has nothing to say to our generation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I have got many disciples. They were formerly theologicians. What is the name, that boy in America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In Arabia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There was a boy. He was theologician. Prajāpati, Prajāpati. Do you remember? He was theologician. Our only request is that Bible confirms there is name. Now, even though they do not know the name, here is the name, Kṛṣṇa. So why people will not take this name to chant? And if by chanting the name there is practical benefit, why they should object? Why they should be so sectarian? Theologician, at least, must not be sectarian. So let the whole world chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So there is no loss. If there is any gain, why not take it? And because you are writing books, therefore I am requesting you to write this, that some of the Christians, they say there is no name, but Christ says there is name, and here is the name. They are chanting, and they are getting profit. We don't want anything. We don't want any price, that I have researched the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> They chant the name...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> ...in orthodox church and also very... They chant the name of Jesus. Again and again, the whole day, they say the word "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, have pity of us. Jesus, Jesus have pity of us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Jesus said, "God, hallowed by Thy name." Jesus never said that "You chant my name." No gentleman says like that. He said, "Hallowed be God. Hallowed by Thy name." And why they are sectarian? If there is name already, why do they not chant it? And what is the harm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> There are so many places. At one point he says, "I have kept them in your name. Thou shalt not take the Lord's name in vain." So many references to the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> The Jews have the Jehova, Jehova name, Jehova, but they don't chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No? They are not following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Jehova. How beautiful it is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very nice. (pause) <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is presented in such a nice way that go on reading, reading there are eighteen thousand verses, and in each verse you will find new knowledge about God, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And if you study one verse, it will take at least one month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes, I suppose so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So eighteen thousand months you have to live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many years, eighteen thousand months?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> About 1,300.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eighteen thousand months, divide by twelve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Twelve thousand months would be thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> 1,500 years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What these theologicians think about God? It is already 1,500 months' substance to read. What they will discover? Teeny discovery? We have already stock for 1,500 years' understanding. So what we have to understand from them? [break] <span class="Italic">...anādir ananta-rūpam.</span> This is only for Kṛṣṇa. But Kṛṣṇa has got expansions-unlimited. <span class="Italic">Advaita, acyuta, ananta. Ananta</span> means unlimited. God, His one feature is Kṛṣṇa, and He has unlimited features. If a gentleman simply reads the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> quietly at home, he will be fully conversant, fully aware of what is God. Just like a scholar. He is not limited in one university or in one book. He reads various books to understand the subject matter of his research. Similarly, those who are actually serious about understanding God, they should not stick only to a particular scripture. They should read all others where the information of God is there. Just like we sometimes quote from Bible, but the Christians, they cannot quote from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>or <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> They cannot do that. But they do not read. Even they do not read fully their Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> No, they don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And still, they want to be masters of understanding God. I have seen many scholars in the western countries. They are well known as Sanskrit scholar. But they cannot quote even a verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> I see. Well, it's a pity. Sanskrit scholars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But I understand in Germany there are many Sanskrit scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> It seems so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Germany there are many learned Sanskrit scholars. But till now I have not met any one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Well, to be a scholar in the usual sense of the word and to really go into the meaning, they are two different things. There are sometimes people who seeks to be a scholar, but in their actual knowledge, they have no insight. And that's also the case in the, with the theologian and the Bible. They know the Bible sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> ...but they don't enter into the meaning. They interpret it just along their small brains because they haven't got the experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Do you want to go this way around, Prabhupāda, or just walk straight on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, straight. Car is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, car is there, following us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artificially they live in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes, there are now millions and millions of children who never have seen a cow, never seen a horse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> They go and stand at the zoo to see an animal. Yes, It's true. And I have just now in my center the visit of six Americans from Chicago who have their psychological center, and they wanted to know what we do, and they told me. They have a special little area where children are taken to see one cow, you see, or one horse just to know what it is because they never see it, never see an animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Most unnatural life. City life, most unnatural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Oh, there are many children, they have never seen a tree. [break] ...sleeping only very few hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very few hours. Say, four, five hours altogether. Altogether. Maximum five, minimum four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> All the night or do you at the day sometimes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. At night I get up at one, at half past one, sometimes half past twelve. But I take a little rest, one or two hour in the daytime. So two hours at night, two hours at day, or three hours at night, two hours in day. In this way, altogether five hours, not more than that. Our predecessor gurus, Gosvāmīs, they were taking rest not more than two hours or 2-1/2 hours. So we should come to that standard, yes. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. About them this description is: they reduced their sleeping, <span class="Italic">nidra. Nidra</span> means sleeping. And <span class="Italic">āhāra. Āhāra</span> means eating and collection. Collection is also <span class="Italic">āhāra.</span> Yes. So they were mendicant. They had no collection. And they had no preaching mission. They were simply writing books. <span class="Italic">Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau,</span> very expert to study different scriptures just to get the essence of scripture and give to the people. <span class="Italic">Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.</span> So their life was engaged for the benefit of the whole human society. What these people are talking philanthropy and humanitarian? They dedicated their life for... Just like we are doing. It is not for any sect or any person. For the whole human society. So that should be the mission. <span class="Italic">Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau.</span> Therefore their literature is honored all over the world, all over the universe. Just like our books. We are selling all over the world, all universities, all school, all colleges, all gentlemen. It is not sectarian. <span class="Italic">Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau.</span> This was their hard labor, and <span class="Italic">rādhā-kṛṣṇa-bhajanānandena mattālikau,</span> and they were very much pleased in worshiping Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity. All the Gosvāmīs established a Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. In Vṛndāvana each and every Gosvāmī established one temple in the beginning. Then others followed. Rūpa Gosvāmī established Govindajī's temple. And Jīva Gosvāmī established Rādhā-Dāmodara temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> The Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa center in Geneva, for instance, has there any connection with you, the Swami Nityabowa-badananda? (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> No, no connection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all impersonalists. The whole world is impersonalist. Perhaps we are only the personalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> You know that the Christian theologian, they think the main difference between them and Eastern religions altogether is that the Christian are personalists and Eastern tradition is not personalist. This is the whole...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Misconception, yes. The majority of Indian population, they are personalists. Yes, majority. Either they worship God or demigod, but they are personalists. Recently the Māyāvādī philosophers, they have poisoned, the impersonalism, calamity. God is person. It is... In the <span class="Italic">Veda</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> There are millions of persons. We are all persons. And God is the chief person. Just like in modern democracy, there is no monarch. But ultimately they have to select one president. Without person, there cannot be government. Why they do not remain without a president? Let it... Government, everything is government, impersonal. Why they select a president?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes. One who takes lead, yes, sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if for a small government, three <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land, you require a personal governor, and such a huge government, millions and millions of universes, how the governor, the Supreme Person, supreme executive, shall not be a person? What is the reason? Actually, at the present moment, people have given up to understand the science of God. That is the defect. They are thinking everything here. Here is advertisement, "Everything here. Come on. Here is a bottle. Here is the pack (peg?). Come on." Everything here. That is the defect. And we are preaching, "Everything is not there." "Everything is lost there," we are preaching. No intoxication. And the material world is preaching, "Everything is there." This is the difference. We are preaching, "Everything is here in Kṛṣṇa, in God." We have... There is a tendency here. Just see. They want to worship Deity. Even on the street side there is such thing. The tendency is to worship Deity, person. I have seen in Rome. In many small lanes, they have got this, yes. Personal worship. So the village men, they are all sleeping now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes. Most of them are sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are enjoying. Sleeping is enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> This is a very ugly village here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? It is very clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Nothing but stone. No gardens, no flowers. Usually it is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In other words, you mean to say that "the village for the stone-hearted."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> The village is for the stone-hearted. Nothing but stones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Once when I was in Paris and walking the streets and nothing but stone and stone and iron and nothing alive, I suddenly heard a voice, coming from beneath, as if there were a big, big one. I heard the voice, if you like, of God and saying, "Well, isn't there not a little spot there where I could manifest myself?" The sadness of God. I heard the voice, "This is the sadness of God." Was very impressive to me. Really a real voice in myself. Because a town like this has no place, no channel, for His voice to come through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> That was the feeling at that moment. [break] ...smell of the baked bread.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor Durckheim:</span> Is it very agreeable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What can be done? We have to be accustomed because we have to go all the western countries, the boiling meat. So let us go out now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You want to go in here, the car. (end)</div>
