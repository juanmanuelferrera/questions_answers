<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The modern education means... Just see what is the disastrous condition. For 531 posts, three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> people have applied. How the unemployment... This application means they are all educated. Uneducated, they do not apply for any post. That means educated unemployed. This is India's so-called education. Without light it is... You can open door. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> First thing, I wanted to go over the daily schedule. According to the schedule, the boys get up between 3:30 and quarter to four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why so early?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Why 3:30 and quarter to four? That's what time we all get up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are holding <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati</span> at five. So why 3:30?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, they do <span class="Italic">japa</span> before <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It will be too early for them. They first of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They're accustomed to getting up at...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They've been getting up at that time for years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are accustomed, that is all right. But otherwise it is not needed, so early. When they go to sleep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> At 8:15.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then it is all right. That is all right. At least they must have rest, six hours, complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh, they get more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then they get ready, bathed and dressed, by about 4:10. So they chant <span class="Italic">japa</span> from 4:10 until five o'clock under the supervision of their teacher. Then <span class="Italic">ārati, tulasī</span> worship. And after <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> worship they again have <span class="Italic">japa</span> up until <span class="Italic">guru-pūjā,</span> greeting the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> From the time <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> worship is over until the time of greeting the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's an hour and fifteen minutes. Altogether they have <span class="Italic">japa</span> time amounting to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who... They will... The small boys, they can devote so much time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well these are not small boys. These are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, teachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> At least ten years, nine, ten years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Nine years old to fourteen years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be engaged in chanting, not sit down and <span class="Italic">japa.</span> That will not be possible for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The problem is that some of the boys are fourteen, fifteen, or thirteen. They should chant <span class="Italic">japa</span> because they are required to chant sixteen rounds a day. Many of them are initia...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixteen rounds, it requires, utmost two hours, two and a half hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, two hours is on the schedule, two hours and ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Chela bangiya</span> (laughter). How are you? That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So they have two hours and five minutes of <span class="Italic">japa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanurdhara:</span> Some boys that are younger, they make a vow to do less and then they can study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Some of the younger boys chant six or eight rounds instead of sixteen. They chant that much during that time and then they study. Then they attend the temple program, <span class="Italic">guru-pūjā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> class. And then after that, they go upstairs, wash their clothes and clean the <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span> That takes them about an hour, to wash their clothes and sweep and cleanse the floor, cleanse the shower room, wash their clothes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, when they chant the <span class="Italic">mantras?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Any <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> At... Right now they're chanting from nine until 9:30 in the morning with Yaśodānandana Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not in the, early in the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> In the early morning I take some of the boys in the Deity room between 5:30 and six the boys and the Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deity means temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Deity? What do you mean, "the Deity room"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Within the Deity room, when they are bathing the Deities, we are offering the prayers to the Deities, the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> and <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why? Deity room? Within the Deity room there is no need of chanting. Who told you this? There is no need. Eh? Within the Deity room? You told?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Sometimes you... I thought you said, for installation or at other times when the Deity is being bathed, to chant <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Within the Deity room there is no business. No business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When we hear the chanting, that's where it's coming from in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They can chant outside, yes. The Deity bathing or whatever, dressing, may go on. You can chant not within the Deity room. That you can do outside. Then when their reading, writing begins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That begins at 10:15, after <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at 9:30, and then at 10:15 their English class begins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just after taking <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. Fifteen minutes after.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. What begins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> English class, that goes for one and a half hours. Then there's math class which goes for forty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not continually. They should be given a recess ten minutes. Then again come to the class. And a class should not be more than forty-five minutes. One class should not be continued more than forty-five minutes, then ten minutes recess, then begin another class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> For the English program it is required, in order for them to have enough time to read and write, then they would require an hour and half, so they would have two classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the meantime, one and a half? You give ten minutes recess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And during the recess what should they do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. They'll be free. Nothing to do. Recess means nothing to do. That is brain, I mean to say, rest. All continually you cannot do that. That is not good. Utmost, forty minutes or forty-five minutes. Then give them ten minutes' freedom. Then begin another. Not more than forty to forty-five minutes at a time, reading, writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> After class, then, by 12:30 they bathe again, second time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> first and then bathe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They bathe... They take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at 9:00 in the morning, 9:30. Then they have class. Then after class is finished, then they bathe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After class they bathe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Around 12:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not needed. After <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> they should not take bathing at least for four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They have a schedule where they have <span class="Italic">dāl,</span> rice, and <span class="Italic">sabji,</span> and <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi</span> at 9:30 in the morning. Is that what they have in the afternoon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? So, when they first take bathing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Uh, when they rise, at around four o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. Then they take the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 9:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 9:30. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We can take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why earlier? Earlier, any breakfast?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not? They are children. They must have some breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They have three meals. One at... This is the way the temple program is scheduled. The temple eats at 9:30 in the morning, so the boys also get <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at that time because everyone eats the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But early in the morning they should have some, at least munch of sweetmeat, something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Like <span class="Italic">chewra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Like <span class="Italic">chewra</span> and curds, they can take. After taking bath at one o'clock they should take little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Early in the morning, just after <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> they can take something. They must take something. They are taking bathing at what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Ten to four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Four o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four o'clock. So after <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> the <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati prasādam</span> should be given them, a little sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> We hadn't agreed on that (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, the <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati</span> sweets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Maṅgala-ārati</span> sweets, they should be distributed amongst the children, little sweets. Then they can take 9:30 <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Full <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then? Again they are taking bathing at what time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The scheduled next bathing is 12:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the... 12:30, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> After bathing they take a little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then at 1:30 they take some rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's nice. How long?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then they have Sanskrit class from 2:30 until four.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. 2:30, four, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One and a half hours. So there should be a recess in between.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's one and a half hours, so there should be recess in between.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten minutes at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then at four o'clock the chanting party leaves for the Yamunā procession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In process... That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And they return by six for <span class="Italic">darśana</span> in the temple room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, let them return by 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> Can we have the class while we're there? 'Cause it takes us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, we can adjust this. Because <span class="Italic">darśana</span> begins at 5:30, they should be there by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">darśana</span> begins at five...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 5:30. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee 2:</span> It was at six o'clock in the evening. Originally it was at six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The <span class="Italic">darśana</span> opens at five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, when you come into the temple room, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your <span class="Italic">darśana</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, my <span class="Italic">darśana</span> is different. Public <span class="Italic">darśana.</span> When the Deity room is open?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> At five o'clock in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Why do you say six?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Uh, I meant that when the <span class="Italic">darśana</span> period for yourself was at six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it should be 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 5:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> General <span class="Italic">darśana</span> is open at five. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So then the boys would return at 5:30...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think it may be little earlier, no, half an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Half an hour, it would be because the <span class="Italic">ārati</span> is going at 6:30...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> So the afternoon <span class="Italic">darśana</span> would be at 4:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> That we had, many, last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then the boys would come for the chanting and recitation of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> 5:30 to 6:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, 5:30 we begin class. In that class they can chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And then, at 6:30, there will be <span class="Italic">ārati</span> and they'll stay for <span class="Italic">ārati.</span> Then, after <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> they take a little <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and then take rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And as far as everyone's duties are concerned, Rūpa-vilāsa is the English teacher. He teaches English, and math, and, of course, Pradyumna teaches the Sanskrit program. And Dhanurdhara Prabhu has been. He works in the <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> overseeing the boys...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Taking care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes. And Yaśodānandana Mahārāja will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Recitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> And I also help with getting the boys through <span class="Italic">japa</span> and <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and getting them more enthusiastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's nice to have a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> involved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He can be a good example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> And Bhagatji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For feeding. Feeding. Give them sumptuous food so that they may become healthy, nice food. (laughter) Yes. That is also wanted. Children, they must eat sufficiently. Not overeat. Even overeat, that is not wrong for children. And that will be exercise, by going to Yamunā and coming? That will be bodily exercise. This is nice. Do that. Strictly follow. There is no scarcity of space there, yes. Vṛndāvana is holy place. And there is no government interference, so increase it. Bring more student from all over the world. Then it will be unique. And you also make scheme to get Indian children from aristocratic family. <span class="Italic">Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are born in high-class, rich family or <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, they are not ordinary. But there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family now. So at least the richer section, they can be induced to send their boys to learn Sanskrit and English and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-bhakti.</span> They can do business, and whatever they like, they can do later on. But these things, they should be... Father-mother should be careful. (Hindi conversation) ...just attract all good family children. (Hindi) ...working, they will have to live. They cannot. They cannot become <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> or spiritually advanced men. They have to work. But if the richer section, they get their sons, good character, good devotee. Cāṇakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">ko 'tha putreṇa jātena yo na vidyā na bhaktimān:</span> (?)"What is the use of such son who is neither devotee nor learned?" <span class="Italic">Kāṇena cakṣuṣā kiṁ cakṣuḥ pīḍaiva kevalam.(?)</span> What is the use of blind eyes? It is simply troublesome. So if the aristocratic family, they do not give education in spiritual line, they'll become all hippies, loafer, and drinking, and wasting father's money. They should be informed. (Hindi) [break] I think there must be three, four classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Three four classes afterwards, but at present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> If students are in great number, then we shall introduce, otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Classes to be arranged according to the number of student increases. That's all. That shall be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Now there are two classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There are two classes according to age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kata (?)</span> according to time and circumstance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> In my opinion, Prabhupāda, there should be one period for Hindi classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Forty minutes, forty-five minutes</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very good. That is essential. If the Indian students come they will require some vernacular like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Hindi class there should be. In Vṛndāvana they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Do that, Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> In Māyāpura there should be Bengali class. And Hindi and Bengali, two language are very close.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not any other language. Hindi is essential, must be compulsory, Hindi. That is state language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> For the Western children also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> You should find some time, entrust some time for Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindi, Sanskrit, English compulsory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> That's all. Then, afterwards we can make other, just elemental mathematics, arithmetic or just that, afterwards, when the regular studies go in the (indistinct). Now (indistinct), these three things. By learning Hindi they will (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the government also will like that, that foreign students...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> If they can understand the language and they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, Hindi is essential. It is not difficult. The same principle as Sanskrit. Reading and writing, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> So far as the financial situation, I've discussed with Bhagatji and it seems that the best idea is to open a separate <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> maintenance account with co-signers Bhagatji and Rūpa-vilāsa, so that... Because there's so much...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then some of them, they are getting money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes, the parents are sending money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because with the temple there has been confusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the temple, you can make separate account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We have one question about one of the boys. His name is (name withheld), and he's a... He's more or less a bad boy. He's had a bad background. His mother's a devotee and she's a nice devotee, but he's very... He terrorizes the other boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He misleads them. He lies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How old he is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He's thirteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he cannot be... He must go back. We cannot spoil other children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa-vilāsa:</span> They are being spoiled by him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I was thinking, to make an example of him, either we should beat him or send him back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best thing will be send him back. He's incorrigible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Personally I had that boy with me for two months when I went to South India, preaching, and I thought it would be an asset to have a young boy, but he was so misbehaved that it was too much problem. And the same things that he was doing, in the beginning with me, telling lies and misbehaving, he is still doing now and he does not correct himself never. He has no effort to better his behavior or his conduct. He does not chant his rounds. He rarely comes to the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> or else when he comes to the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> he does not chant. He simply plays and makes fun. And it's very... He has a very bad influence on the other boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then he should be sent back. Or he can be sent to Bombay to work ordinarily. Or Hyderabad farm. Like that. Let him work on the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He speaks Bengali. That boy was in Bengal before and he picked up Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He's very intelligent, but he's just had a bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was in Māyāpura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes, he was in Māyāpura before. He knows Bengali. He can speak Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he can go with the Māyāpura preaching party as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> We could send him with Bhavānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that will be nice. He knows Bengali. Let him go to Bengal and keep him under Bhavānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think that he'll be a problem wherever he goes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Bhavānanda will correct his problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I think Bhavānanda won't want to take him because he knows he's a problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa-vilāsa:</span> Bhavānanda told me he did not want to see that boy again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpa-vilāsa:</span> Bhavānanda told me he did not want to see that boy again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> In Māyāpura he had some girl...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In my opinion, the best thing is to make an example and beat him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, send him to farm, work in the field. If he does not work, beat him. <span class="Italic">Mūrkhasya laktausadhiḥ.</span> (?)(Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He was just in Hyderabad for that ceremony there, and he caused such disruption in the whole temple that I don't think they'd want him there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The thing is, if we beat him here and keep him here, then all the boys will straighten up because they will see that if they go bad, then this will be their punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you think, you can do. But I wanted to engage in farm work, in digging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes, that is his propensity. Actually it's a fact when he was with me I would try to teach him <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> and your purports, which are so clear and simple, but after three or four times explaining the same thing, he would become angry to receive the instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He is meant for <span class="Italic">śūdra's</span> work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> And when that boy would be told to watch himself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot expect that everyone is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> No. He has got <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> mentality, so let him till the ground for Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Svakarmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> He is fit for tilling so let him till and produce grain for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hard work. He should be given hard work. This <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> is for high, high class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriyas,</span> not for the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> (man laughs in background) No, everyone is required for Kṛṣṇa's service, but there... That I was describing today. There must be division. Don't put horse before a cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Race horse before the cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Race horse before the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that will not be nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiśya</span> is meant for <span class="Italic">kṛṣi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If you don't teach <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> for this <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> then how do they do the accounts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are not taking <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> by birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Accounts is just a skill. Anyone can learn to do account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> is special work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, accounts are meant for <span class="Italic">kāyasthas, śūdras.</span> (Indian man laughs) <span class="Italic">Vaiśyas</span> are meant for producing grain and protecting cows. Yes. According... One Englishman used to say, "This clerical job means educated laborer, educated <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span>" (laughs) <span class="Italic">Śūdra...</span> Actually the <span class="Italic">kāyasthas</span> are counted amongst the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> In Bengal <span class="Italic">kāyasthas</span> is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Bengal. Mean in U.P.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> In U.P. <span class="Italic">kāyasthas</span> are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And originally they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> The history of Bengali <span class="Italic">kāyasthas...</span> They went with the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> as servant. That is the history. And in Bengal the system is... (Bengali saying and Hindi explanation) Actually it is... If some low class man, he becomes rich, then he's taken into the <span class="Italic">kāyastha</span> community. Anyone who cannot stick to the principle of caste system, he becomes a <span class="Italic">kāyastha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Hindi) Some of them are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and some of them... Like that. But that is not essential. That is all gone. Now, if one cannot take education, he can be used in farm work, a little hard work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> (name withheld) is another problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> (name withheld), (name withheld)'s boy. He is only eight, but he is becoming like a street boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him go to farm working. Farm working is for suitable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> He likes that. He'll play with cows. He likes dung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He likes dung.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Let him take care. He should take care. Therefore we must have all these engagement. He'll be encouraged to take care of the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> But he's not in <span class="Italic">Gurukula.</span> How can you send him? He is with (father's name withheld). (father name withheld) left him for five days. (father name withheld) is keeping him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the father takes care, that's all right. Otherwise he can go to Hyderabad. Hyderabad should be for <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> for plowing, for growing, and flowers, like that. No education required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> He is not interested in education, not at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no education... That is waste of... For such boys who are not interested, why they should be enforced, education? They are not meant for that. Education is for higher brain, sober brain. And not that everyone has to become literate. It is not required. He can do other work. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Prabhupāda means that according to the nature, you engage them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> "You can do this? All right, do it. Why you should be forced to learn Sanskrit? Not necessary. Not necessary."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanurdhara:</span> What of a boy who does the chanting nicely and the <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> nicely but doesn't do the school work nicely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanurdhara:</span> What of a boy who does the <span class="Italic">japa</span> very nicely and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, <span class="Italic">japa...</span> Whether his father is doing <span class="Italic">japa</span> nicely, that is also doubtful. What to speak of children? <span class="Italic">Japa,</span> children cannot... That should not be taken very seriously. Whatever he can do, that's all right. We should enforce, we should... But not that if he does not immediately, he should be rejected. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> You've often said the first-class intelligent men are the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> second-class intelligent men are the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to train like that, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ,</span> not that everyone should be Sanskrit scholar. Why? It is not necessary. There are so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The inclination depends on <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Although by nature we should not enforce something. We should see for which work he is suitable. You should engage him. And we must have all departments of work-the weaving department, the plowing department, the cow-keeping department, the Sanskrit department, the English department, the trading department. We should have all the departments. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Head, arms, belly, and legs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Whichever suitable, that... One must be suitable for any of these. It is the guide's intelligence: for which purpose he is suitable engage him, like that. That is required, not that everyone has to become a big scholar in Sanskrit. That is not required. Let him come to <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> but if he is not suitable... <span class="Italic">Gurukula,</span> this... So far character is con..., that is for everyone. Just like early rise in the morning, chanting, and going to the... What is the objection? Anyone can do it. That is practice. And for working, if he is not suitable for higher education, let him go to the farm, take care of the cows and grow food, flowers, fruits, eat, and dance and chant. Chanting, dancing, everyone will take part. There is no doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> How to mend him from lies? He speaks lies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> How to mend from lies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is by your good association. What lies he tells? Don't believe him at all. That's all. Take him that he speaks only lies. Then don't believe. Whatever he says, you force him to do. Take him that he speaks only lies. Why should you consult him? He's a liar. But see that he's working, that's all. Now we are getting so much land. We can develop. We can utilize everyone's service. That requires brain. Not that "He cannot do this. Therefore reject him"-no, engage him in some other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One other point I want to make, and that is that until the construction is completed I think we should wait...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is ample place now where can live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But I mean to bring more boys we should wait until the construction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Let them come. It is already there. It is not that the guesthouse is all filled up. Let them come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> As many as possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them come. And arrangement should be made when it is... If Vṛndāvana is too hot, at that time we can send them to Mahabalesvara, or if we get that Madras place, that is very cooling, Nilgiri hills. That will be good recreation for them. They should be kept quite comfortably and built up, their character, education. That is wanted. There is need of some good first-class men, ideal men. The world is full of rogues and thieves and bad character. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> I just told you that building, that Śiśu-vidyālaya(?), Sarasvatī Śiśu-vidyālaya, you saw it with Guṇārṇava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Prabhupāda asks about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Oh. But they said no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagatji:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Guṇārṇava went to see them, Mr. what's his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot send Guṇārṇava. He is not fit for this purpose. You should go yourself. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's our report, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
