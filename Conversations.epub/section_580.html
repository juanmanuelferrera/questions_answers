<div class="Heading">Morning Walk<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>May 27, 1975, Honolulu</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The following is Śrīla Prabhupāda's morning walk conversation in Honolulu, Hawaii, on May 27th, 1975, on Waikiki Beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] ...and the water. (Hindi). [break] ...and one fourth land and we are puzzled with the increase of population. But there is no puzzle, three-fourths water population. Wherever you go, you get immediately many thousand fishes. So just imagine how many fishes are there. These rascals say "Overpopulation." Why not overpopulation there? Huh? The fishes, for want of food, they are dying and floating? Why overpopulation? All their calculation are simply bogus. There is no question of overpopulation. Even... Just like people simply can live on mango and coconut. Where is the question of over-population? It is chastisement. When one cannot get proper food, that is not due to overpopulation. It is due to godlessness. As soon as people will become godless, nature will chastise them-no food, no rain, suffer. This is law. (?) [break] ...signpost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> Private property .</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is private, nobody..., nothing belongs to God. This is their idea. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> ...mountain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the <span class="Italic">timiṅgila,</span> they are as big as this mountain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> I wouldn't want to meet one of those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can go, and you will find in his belly. [break] You think simply small fishes are there? As the ocean is big, similarly, very, very big fishes are there. [break] ...up. Remain deep in the water. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> A very dark condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why dark condition? They are living very happily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> It's dark in the bottom of the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not dark. They have got their light. Everywhere arrangement is there. Otherwise how they can live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> It's also very cold in the bottom of the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cold for you, (laughter) not for them (laughs). Everything, these rascal scientists consider in relation, relatively. But relative world means every living being is relatively existing with a condition. And he is thinking only his relative condition. That is their foolishness. You cannot fly in the sky; a small bird will fly. That is called relative world. For his condition, it is different from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They've done filming at the bottom of the sea, and they've seen many of the fish at the bottom of the sea, in the deep portions, they make their own light. From their bodies they have light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like down this planet there are dark... There are many other planets, Talātala... They are dark. The sunshine does not go there. But there are serpents who has got big, big jewels on the hood. That makes the light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Maṇi.</span> They're called <span class="Italic">maṇi</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ah. [break] ...<span class="Italic">kim asau na bhayaṅkaraḥ.</span> "A serpent decorate with jewel, is it not ferocious?" Similarly a bad man, even if he is so-called learned and scientist, he is also ferocious... [break] ...demon. Bad man means who does not recognize the supremacy of God. Bad man. This is bad, demon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The scientists say that in the beginning of the planet there were only little bacteria and algae.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His father, his great-grandfather. The scientists' great-grandfather, bacteria. Because from that bacteria his father developed and he was born, so therefore the bacteria his great-grandfather.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, they say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. Then how you got so much knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> From fossils.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From bacteria? How rascals they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> it also states that there are nine divisions of creation, and that in the first creation there's the plants and trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but these different bodies, and the soul is transmigrating, that they do not know. The soul is getting a different type of body according to his desires, not the body is developing. This I have explained many times, that you get the apartment according to the rent you are able to pay, not that a small apartment is becoming a skyscraper building. That is their theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But is there a great time period between the different divisions of the creation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everything is there already. It becomes manifest. Just like beneath the water there is land already. And when the water will dry, land will be manifest. Not that the land is created. No, it is already there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> ...told us last time that actually the earth did not come out of the water, but the water receded, and this is how this Hawaii came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> There was water covering everything, and then the water receded, and then the land was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. From creative method, from water, land has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. Gross to..., from subtle to gross.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> There are different devastations by water as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] There is a Bengali proverb, <span class="Italic">ādār vapare yahare khabor (?)</span> A man is dealing with ginger. So ginger is used... Suppose we take ginger, a few small pieces. You cannot expect ginger selling in wagons. (laughs) Ginger is accepted-you purchase one or two pieces, that's all. So a merchant dealing in ginger is asking, "What is the fare of one big freight? I shall take ginger that." He is selling only two pieces, and he's taking information of a big freighter. Similarly, these rascals, they are dealing with small things and contemplate describing (?) life. What about that moon expedition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Rocks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, rocks, that is the last. Now what is the latest news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They want to send a satellite to the other planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moon finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, it is not good for... It is too much money. They cannot afford it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> It's nothing but rocks anyway there. They think it is nothing but rocks so why waste time, go to some other place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Grapes are sour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jackal. Jackal and the grapes. The grapes were high. First of all jumped, jumping. Then, when he could not get it, "This is useless. It is sour."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They didn't reach moon at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At all. Jumping, jumping, the jackal says, "Oh, it is no use. It is sour."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I've seen those rocks, moon rocks. They didn't seem much different than our rocks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is all bogus propaganda. I told it in 1968. No, no, not '68-'58, in my book, <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets.</span> All childish. Then I told in San Francisco in 1968, like that. They asked me, the press reporter, "What is your opinion?" "It is all useless waste of time and energy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Now they will have to agree with you. It's so much trouble. But the thing is that the scientists will lose their jobs if they do not make people want to go to..., useless things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But one thing is the people in general, they are so rubbish and brainless that they believe. They do not use their common sense. I am also one of the member, but I use my common sense. We have read from the Vedic literature the moon planet is influencing the vegetation in this planet, and there is no vegetation. The moon planet... These are explained that influencing vegetation in this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Some big, big scientists, they had a convention about evolution and geology, but they made a rule at the beginning that during the convention no one could bring up the subject of divine creation or God. And then they will discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are going to, I mean to say, hold a convention that life is from chemicals. Our Svarūpa Dāmodara told. Japan it is going to be held. And by their resolution, it will be accepted. But they cannot create.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But I had one question. Is it possible to create a suitable environment for life to enter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Life enters into the matter. Then it comes out with a particular type of body. The soul enters in the womb of the mother and the mother gives the body. The soul comes through the semina of the father, and then the mother's ovum and father's semina mix together, creates a situation for developing a body. This is the science. Without that living entity there is no question of pregnant. Simply a mixture of matter. No, that is not possible. (Boys heckling in background.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Boys:</span> Rascals! Cheater!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> The all-American family. If the moon is illuminating the earth at night, then how come you have brought back dull pieces of rock. They should have also been shining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Did they actually land on the moon, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they cannot go there. What is the question of landing? They cannot go there. It is far, far away. What you calculated? 1,600,000 miles away, up the sun planet. 1,600,000 miles above the sun. According to your calculation, the sun is away from this planet by 93,000,000 miles. And above that, 1,600,000 miles. Then you go to the moon. How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> How is the moon behind the sun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not behind, above.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> It is a bigger planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> In other words, to elevate oneself to the moon planet, that is harder than going to the sun planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is God's wish. "You can go up on Me? What is this?" Their calculation is that moon is nearer, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span>. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But not moon is nearer; sun is nearer. And above, in the proportion, 1,600,000 miles, above moon there is Mercury, Mars, in this way, Venus. It is not so easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The planets are not orbiting the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They have got their different orbits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span>. This is real science, to know these facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> So how can you prove that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Śruti-pramāṇam. Śruti</span> means <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> What is that? That is another island?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's the Kaneohe marine base.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> A marine base, army base.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They have missiles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> In these mountains, and the mountain opens, the missile comes out. It's ready to be fired, atomic missiles. This whole island is nothing but army bases. The Japanese in the World War II, they first came here and bombed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pearl Harbor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> Yeah, and this is a very good place to bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Pearl Harbor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> Yes, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Here it is? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> No, no, this isn't it. This is a very likely place for them to drop their bombs. There's too many marine bases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is a sitting place? [break] ...introduce that "Why you are, rascal, you are introducing all this nonsense?" Let them read this. They will become human being. That is the business of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They are reading only all rubbish things and becoming rubbish. Let them read these books, and their human life will be perfect. <span class="Italic">Na yad vacaś citra-padaṁ harer yaśaḥ:</span> [SB 1.5.10] "The literature which does not give information of the glories of the Lord," <span class="Italic">tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham,</span> "it is just like the pleasure place of the crows." So these books are meant for the crows, without any right information, without any God's information. <span class="Italic">Tad vāyasaṁ tīrtham uśanti mānasāḥ. </span> The swans will not come there. The pleasure place of the crows is not meant for the swans. They have got different place. Our books are meant for swans, and all these literatures are meant for the crows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> The trouble is is that even if we explain these things to most people, factually their only interest is how they can eat, and how they can gratify their senses, and they take these other scientists up as the extracurricular...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 2.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Those who have lost their identity, being captivated by <span class="Italic">bhoga</span> and <span class="Italic">aiśvarya,</span> they cannot understand." <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānām. Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahataḥ.</span> For slight, so-called happiness they are making big, big problems (projects?). <span class="Italic">Māyā... bharam. Bharam</span> means big, big problems. (projects?). And sometimes they put forward their whim (?) for the next generation. Now, if Darwin's theory accepted, the monkeys never thought of the next generation, so how you have got this consciousness(?)? Why you are thinking of your next generation? What is the argument? The monkey cannot think that Mr. Nixon will come, become president of this or that, U.S.A. So how he became president without your thinking of the, your forefathers, monkeys? So why you are thinking of your generation? Your forefathers did not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, but by Darwinism they become reduced to just animals, no better than monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is meant for the monkeys, not for any sane gentleman. Sane gentleman will think that "I have become now... By evolution I have come to this stage human being. What is next? And that is sane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> That is a good argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He will think, "What is next? Is it finished here?" The rascal says, "No, after finishing, everything is finished." What is this? If there is evolution-you have come to this stage -then what is the next stage? That is natural. That is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yānti deva-vratā devān [Bg. 9.25].</span> Now you can go to the moon planet if you try. Moon planet, sun planet, Venus and so many. If you become serious. And you can go to God's planet, <span class="Italic">mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām.</span> Now you select where will you will go. But there is spiritual planet. But what is their theory? That after finishing this body, everything is finished.(?) They do not believe in the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Therefore their life must be hopeless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hopeless, yes. [break] Yes, you can send him to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru kṛpā:</span> But there is no "after" here because there is so much to plant here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yesterday at night we got many plants, and this morning also we got lots of more plants, flower plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's all right. But somebody may learn from him and go to India. (end)</div>
