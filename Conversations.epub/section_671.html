<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmācarya. Brahmācarya</span> means completely cessation from sex life. This is <span class="Italic">brahmācarya. Tapasya</span> begins, austerity. This is the greatest austerity, to cease sex. <span class="Italic">Tapasa brahmācarya.</span> Our Vedic civilization, the boys are trained how to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> from the very beginning of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. [break] ... <span class="Italic">putrakā yena śuddhyet sattva.</span> Our existentional position should be purified. How? <span class="Italic">Tapo,</span> by <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyet sattva [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "And we are enjoying life. Why we should undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya?</span>" And you are enjoying, but you are not enjoying; you are suffering. Even if you think you are enjoying, there are so many sufferings. That the foolish people, they do not know. Just like a healthy man, he thinks, "I am enjoying," but he does not see that even he is now healthy, he will be an old man, he will be attacked with disease, he will die, and still he thinks, "I am healthy." <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> Therefore the intelligent man will see that "Where is my enjoyment if I am going to die? I don't want to die, but I am going to die." That is sure, as sure as anything. And still the rascal will think that "I am happy." He will become old man, he will be attacked with disease, and still he is thinking that he is happy. Apart from this, there are so many other sufferings, but he thinks that he is happy. And that happiness is centered around sex. That's all. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunadi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Their only happiness is sex. Therefore in the Western countries they are simply trying to increase the sex enjoyment. That's all. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole civilization is based on how to enjoy sex very nicely. This is their basic principle of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Always on the best-seller charts of the books there is always some book about how to enjoy sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. There are books here also, <span class="Italic">Kāma-śāstra.</span> So sex enjoyment also you cannot enjoy unlimitedly. Then you will become impotent. Then you will have to call your wife as "mother," as some saintly person did. He was indulging in sex in his young age, and when he was married he saw himself impotent, and therefore he invented some way that "I have realized Brahman. I can call my wife also 'mother.' " And he became famous-"Oh, he is so advanced. He has learned how to..." But in the history we will not find this. Even Vyāsadeva had his wife, but he never said his wife, "mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually you're supposed to see other women as mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But not one's own wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Para-dāreṣu. Mātravat para-dareṣu.</span> That is the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śās...</span> Other's wife. Not that "Oh, my wife is also my mother." Just see. This lunacy is going on, and this lunatic man is taken as incarnation of God. This is going on. This homosex propaganda is another side of impotency. So that is natural. If you enjoy too much, then you become impotent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are trying to make that more and more accepted in America, homosex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The churches accept. It is already law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> This women's liberation movement, the leaders are also homosexual. They're lesbians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Just see. Hare Kṛṣṇa. The whole world is on the verge of ruination. <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...become ruined. The world is on the verge of ruination, but it doesn't become ruined; so therefore they think, "Oh, it doesn't matter. We can go on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is the meaning of ruination. [break] ...so many problems. Still it is not on the verge of ruination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's on the verge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But why you are very much disturbed with so many problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya :</span> They always take the brighter side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They are discussing, "There will be no more petrol. There will be no more this, no more that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So they are thinking, "Well, then we'll get the sun power. Then we'll get this and we'll get that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is the problem. It is not that "Theoretically here is a problem. I will solve it like this. I'll..." That is not solution of problem. Problem is there. When you actually make solution, then... This is madness, theorizing, "We shall solve the problem like this." They are wasting public money in so many ways. [break] They do not know what is real problem. The real problem is presented by Kṛṣṇa: <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9].</span> That they do not care, although they do not want it. That's a fact. It is a problem because they do not want it. But they do not take it as serious problem. This is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> President Ford, he was almost killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> What about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Some woman... He was mingling in the crowd for the election, and some woman came up to him. She was two feet away from him, and she took out of her purse a loaded pistol, and she was to go like this, and then she was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Captured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nayanābhirāma:</span> He was going to shake her hand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So the president said, "Oh, this is simply a distraction." He was trying to say it wasn't important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> She is a member of a group, a fanatical group in California. I don't know what... The Manson group? Charles Manson? Who is that group? This man killed about six people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> And I think this man has many wives. He has about two dozen wives. These are all his wives. He's in jail now. Life sentence. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. He was saying, "Oh, it's just a distraction." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the President's life is not safe, and there is no problem. What to speak of others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> An intelligent man will go completely insane because he can't solve the problems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The solution is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> ...without referring to the Vedic philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The solution is there. Take it. Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They're so much implicated by sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gradually they'll become ... understand that this is not good. Therefore <span class="Italic">gṛhastha āśrama</span> is allowed under rules and regulation. The purpose is to restrict sex life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The wife of the President, she recently said that sex life before marriage is good because it will reduce the divorce rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If everyone is prostitute then where is the question of divorce? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> There's also no question of marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And that is going on. (end)</div>
