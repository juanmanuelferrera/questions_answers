<div class="Heading">Conversation with<br class="calibre2"/>Prof. Saligram and Dr. Sukla<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 5, 1976, Washington, D.C.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> There are certain hymns in <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> which are so personal and... And I don't find anything in <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> impersonal. As a matter of fact...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, impersonal there is. Impersonal means negation of this material thing. <span class="Italic">Neti neti,</span> "Not this." Impersonal means not this material person. That is impersonal. Kṛṣṇa is person, but in order to convince people that He's person but not a material person, the material things have to be negated. That is <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad.</span> Just to evade the material conception of the Absolute. But ultimately He's person. <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇo 'ham pratiṣṭhā. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣu [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there. So in order to substantiate the Supreme Person as completely spiritual, the material conception of personality is rejected. That is impersonal. <span class="Italic">Nirguṇa</span> means He has no material qualities. <span class="Italic">Bhakta-vatsala,</span> Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala.</span> That is not material quality, that is spiritual quality. So negation of material understanding is impersonal. But when one is fully in awareness of Kṛṣṇa, His spiritual identity, then again He's person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda gave the example this morning that something which is personal can speak, like Kṛṣṇa spoke <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa's described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as the Supreme. But we don't have any experience of something impersonal like the sky speaking to us. So if the Supreme is impersonal, how is it that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is spoken by Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Māyāvādīs like Swami Vivekananda, he questions "Who was Lord Kṛṣṇa?" Was Kṛṣṇa King of Dvārakā or anybody else, he don't know even that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a fool. He does not know, therefore other does not know. It is not the fact. He's a fool, he does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> He does not know. He said that <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> and writes volumes and volumes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. That is his foolishness. <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is completely <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is finished. And what is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span>? What is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> According to these <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not according, according to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, all the <span class="Italic">karma</span> should be done for Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For Kṛṣṇa, yes. So that is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Yat karoṣi kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Karma-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is the difficulty, that these <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> they have killed India's Vedic civilization. Now India is atheist. Very tragic position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> What are your plans for India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are pushing this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is being appreciated. It will take some time. Because so much mischievous activities have been done by the Māyāvādīs, to counteract, it will take some time. They are simply mischievous. Caitanya Mahāprabhu has rejected them. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī bhāṣya sunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one takes the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span> version of the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> then his spiritual life is finished. He becomes atheist. His spiritual life is finished. Now what is the contribution? You talked about Vivekananda, what is his contribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing. Simply he has taught the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> to eat meat. That is his contribution. He says there is no harm eating meat. This is going on. Nārāyaṇa has become <span class="Italic">daridra. Daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> these are Vivekananda's contribution. And spoiled India's spiritual tradition. He has created one illiterate priest as God. That is his contribution, if we become honest to understand. So it will take some time to counteract all these mischievous activity. Simply mischievous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> How is it that these men are so attractive to the Indian people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have become fools. Fool's paradise, they have been made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Because Vivekananda became very popular in America, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who became popular in America?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No he didn't. That's just propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> That's propaganda, yes, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: :</span>I never heard of Vivekananda until I went to Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The Vedanta Society was formed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the other day we spoke that... Now in Vṛndāvana, you know we have got our temple. So the Ramakrishna Mission, they have got their temple also. In our temple, thousands and thousands of these Americans came, and not a single one went here. If they had preached anything, then why these American boys and girls are not interested, "Let us see where the Ramakrishna Mission stays." They do not know even. There are many present here who went to Vṛndāvana, and none of them were interested to see. Why? lf there was any propaganda... This is practical proof. Why none of them were interested, "Oh, here is also Ramakrishna <span class="Italic">Mandir,</span> let us go here"? Nobody. Is it practical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, of course. Of course, even in India I don't think Vivekananda is that popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Within one period, people who probably just had no good books to read, and they got some of his writings. I know my father brought some books and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is your home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> It's in Benares, Kāśī. So there were some books by Vivekananda, and he is emotionally against Vivekananda, so that's a little too much perhaps. So he brought those books so that I can read them, I was curious. And he said, "When you are through, give it to your cook." (laughter) That's the only functional use of those books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For burning it in the fire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Yes, he said so that we can make our <span class="Italic">capatis,</span> to have some use of those things. And Kṛṣṇa, of course, there's hardly a village in India where, whether knowingly or unknowingly, people are not aware what is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>In India they know, everyone. They observe Janmāṣṭamī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa paraṁ bhajami.</span> In India everybody knows Kṛṣṇa, even the illiterate person, but nobody knows Vivekananda. Only a few people, they started a Vedanta Society. Of course <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is a very serious literature, it's not just anybody can get into that, it's a very, it's a disciplic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra-padaiś caiva hetumādbhir viniścitaiḥ</span> [Bg. 13.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Very.... <span class="Italic">Nyāya-praṣṭhāna.</span> But <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> is explained in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Therefore our Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavas, they did not write any comment on the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> They accept <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the real <span class="Italic">bhāṣya.</span> But when the <span class="Italic">Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇavas</span> are challenged that "You have no <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra-bhāṣya,</span> therefore you cannot be accepted as transcendental party," so Baladeva Vidyābhūṣana immediately gave <span class="Italic">Govinda-bhāṣya</span> on Vedānta. Our Gosvāmīs, they did not write because they knew <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra bhāṣya, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was also a victim of this Vivekananda philosophy for a long time, and my father was very against.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> There is no philosophy, but it was amusing... My father all the time was telling me to do some devotional service, I was... No, if I would not do it, I would not get my breakfast. So I had to do it. But now you have your books and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I read Ramakrishna when I was fifteen years old, and I became so restless and anxious for guru, and I began to concentrate so much, and I become so God conscious. But I don't know what happened to me by reading Ramakrishna, and I gave up my (indistinct). I don't know what's wrong with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? (devotees laugh) What is the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The question is that she was so much inspired when she was very young, she read some words by Ramakrishna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What was the particular thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then she started looking for guru. She became very aware of the need for guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> That's why I found you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Many of us who have similar experiences like that. Naturally, we weren't always so fortunate that we first came in contact with Prabhupāda's books or his disciples. But somehow or another we weren't satisfied by anything, because there was some gap, some void, some missing information that didn't satisfy us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which portion appealed to you in Ramakrishna's life? Which portion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> (indistinct) When he used to be married he wrote some songs, he used to practice to sing, he used to chant and he used to cry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Of course, first we were talking about Vivekananda, not Ramakrishna. They are two different personalities and two different paths.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> Yes, but I thought Ramakrishna... Many times I get devotees who say to me, "Oh, he's a rascal." I say, "I don't know, I can't say rascal." I don't read him, but he inspired me so much. And I don't know what's wrong. Am I wrong or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now what is the philosophy of Ramakrishna?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> He does not say that Kṛṣṇa is God. (indistinct) and I was very young at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to discuss, there is points of discussion. (laughs) Yes. He worshiped Kali, is it not? Everyone knows it. Do you know that? And by worshiping he became God. Do you agree to that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> No. He said, "I'm Rāma and Kṛṣṇa both."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he realized by worshiping Kali. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...he dressed up as Rādhārāṇī too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do you agree to that? Then how you appreciate it? <span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> No, I don't appreciate it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It is a common sense. He, later on, he became God, by worshiping Kali, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> He was cursed by Kali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he was a big worshiper of Kali. And he was meat-eater also, Ma Kali's <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> that unless one eats that <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> he cannot become a devotee. So this was his position, that he worshiped Kali, and later on by worshiping Kali... His picture is there, mother Kali's embracing. And he also preached <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat:</span> "Whatever path you take, accept, that is all right." Is it not? So do you think it is all right? He worshiped Kali and he said <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> You agree to this? Now, Ramakrishna says <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> And Kṛṣṇa says... He became Ramakrishna, identifying himself with Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">mam ekam,</span> and now he's becoming Kṛṣṇa, he says <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> Just see. When he's actual Kṛṣṇa, he says <span class="Italic">mām ekam,</span> and when he became imitation Kṛṣṇa, he says <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> Kṛṣṇa has changed his views. (laughter) Just see, this foolishness is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Well, it's documented that he was kind of deranged, of a deranged mind. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Yes, because he was, when he was thirteen or seventeen he was walking, he was going from one village to another village through the paddy fields, and the clouds were very thick and thunder and lightning, and he writes that he saw Kali, and I have a friend in England, Carl Wilson, who has done some work on Ramakrishna, he believes that at that very moment...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are miracles, that's all. It has no value. People are after miracles. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said <span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajante 'nya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are worshipers of other demigods, they are <span class="Italic">hṛta-jñānāḥ. Hṛta-jñānāḥ.</span> Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura gives his comment, <span class="Italic">hṛta-jñānāḥ naṣṭa buddhayaḥ,</span> one who has lost his intelligence. So by worshiping the demigod Kali he is to be considered as <span class="Italic">hṛta-jñānāḥ,</span> one who has lost his intelligence-and he becomes God. Is it possible? One who has lost his intelligence, he becomes God. With that lost intelligence. And this is the proof that on account of lost intelligence, he says <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mām ekam. Sarva dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> And when he became Ramakrishna, same Kṛṣṇa is speaking, <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat.</span> So he has changed his view. We have to accept this? And how he gave up his wife, that's a long history, I don't wish to discuss. We know everything. So we cannot accept something which is beyond the instruction of <span class="Italic">śāstra. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">yaḥ śāstra vidhim utsṛjya<br class="calibre2"/>vartate kāma kārataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>na sa siddhim avāpnoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">If you have no knowledge of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> then you'll never be successful in your spiritual life, what to speak of happiness and liberation. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian woman:</span> Is Mirabai Lord Caitanya's disciple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm talking of this Ramakrishna particularly. There is no <span class="Italic">śāstra siddha.</span> Whimsical, sentiment, that's all. So far his <span class="Italic">yata mata tata pat</span> is concerned, at last he proposed, "Now I shall worship according to the Muhammadan process. So I have to eat cow's flesh." So he was living in that temple... What is that temple in Calcutta? Daksinesvari. So the temple was owned by one big <span class="Italic">zamindar.</span> So because it is temple, he cannot take... Of course, in that temple Kali was there. So they are taking fish and flesh. That was not objectionable. But he, when he wanted to take cow's flesh, so he wanted permission from proprietor, "Sir, I shall now practice according to Muhammadan system. So I take cow's flesh. So I want your permission." So he said, "Sir, I've given you so much licenses, but if you ask this, then I'll ask you to go out. I cannot give you this permission." Then he stopped Muhammadan way of worship. This is whimsical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> We have another mentally retarded person in India, Sai Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have that newspaper from South Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyway, we are not after all this magic. We are laymen. We do not want this magic, neither we want to show magic. We simply, as canvasser of Kṛṣṇa, we are preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, "Sir, Kṛṣṇa says like this, you do like that," that's all. If you like, you can do; otherwise let us do our own business. We don't show any magic, neither we speak anything which is not in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. If there is little success, it is due to this secret, that's all. (Bengali) Kṛṣṇa says that He is Supreme, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are preaching, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme," that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Therefore you are doing so with tremendous success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, people say that "Swamiji, you have done wonder, you have..." so on, so on, so on. But I do not know what is wonder. I know it is certain that I have not adulterated. That much I know. But I do not know how to play wonders. That I do not know. But I am certain that I have not adulterated what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all. And I study everything by the crucial test of Kṛṣṇa's teaching. That's all. Kṛṣṇa says:</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">As soon as we see that somebody is not Kṛṣṇa conscious or Kṛṣṇa's devotee, I take them immediately he's a <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina,</span> he's a <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> he's a <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> "Oh, he's educated!" <span class="Italic">māyāyapahṛta-jñānā.</span> Finish. Our study finish. We take it immediately that here is a <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> Because he denies to accept Kṛṣṇa, he must be within this group. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> So people will be sorry or happy, we take them like that, that "Here is a <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina,</span>" that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Tulasi dāsa has also said that who is not God, Kṛṣṇa, conscious, you should treat them like your enemy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, that <span class="Italic">asat-saṅga tyāga vaiṣṇava ācāra.</span> The Vaiṣṇava's behavior is to give up bad company. Who is bad? Next question will be that "I have to give up the bad company. Who is bad?" Then He says, next line: <span class="Italic">asat stri saṅgī 'kṛṣṇabhakta' āra.</span> Two words. Those who are too much attached to woman and those who are not devotees of Kṛṣṇa, they are bad. So Caitanya Mahāprabhu says give up the company of these two bad men, that's all. That is Vaiṣṇava. So everything is there. If you simply follow with sincerity, then Kṛṣṇa is pleased. As Arjuna says, "Yes, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava [</span>Bg. 18.73]<span class="Italic">.</span>" That's all. He becomes perfect. And Kṛṣṇa immediately accepts, <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> He becomes immediately recognized by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">. Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">. Priya-kṛttamaḥ,</span> superlative. <span class="Italic">Priya-kṛt, priya-kṛtara, priya-kṛttamaḥ.</span> So let us follow the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, our life will be perfect. That is a fact. Don't divert your attention here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, you were a chemist before, but I think you are the greatest alchemist to have taken so many leaden souls and turned them into golden Vaiṣṇavas. Perhaps you can even transform them (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is giving us facilities to preach this cult. Everywhere we have got very, very palatial buildings to accommodate devotees. Now we have got here a very nice place, accommodate devotees. Everywhere we have got. In Bombay we are getting the best temple in India. We are spending crores of rupees, Kṛṣṇa is giving us money. So I started the business with forty rupees. That was also not American currency. They allowed me to bring forty rupees. So when I was getting off the ship I asked the captain, "I have brought these forty rupees, which will not be accepted here, so you take." At that time three books I had, the first, second and third volume. So I asked him that "You purchase. Give me some dollars." So he asked, "What is the price?" "Sixteen dollars." So he gave me twenty dollars, and I delivered them. With that twenty dollars I got out down on the land of America, and that forty rupees. So I did not know where to go, where to stay. So Kṛṣṇa is giving us all facilities, and these American boys are helping. I think those who are Indians, they should join this movement sincerely and preach more vigorously. People will be benefited-this is real substance. Otherwise people are being misguided, so many things going on. Transcendental meditation, the, what is called? No, another. So many. Actually, speaking for the last at least two hundred years, many swamis, people came here, but not a single person was converted to become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That is history. What do you think, Sukla? You have studied. So many swamis, yogis, scholars came, and they spoke on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and other, but not a single person became a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> I think they try to be impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be. They are supposed to be great personalities, but not a single person was converted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> (indistinct) ...he was asked who is such a master. He pointed out could not answer who can be such a master. He posed himself as a spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here is an opportunity to preach real India's traditional culture. So those who are Indians present here, they should cooperate. They should not mislead further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> We have started teaching your <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> at Georgetown University, where I teach. Before we had, we have two years course of Sanskrit, and we had some excerpts from <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and some <span class="Italic">Pañca-tantra</span> and so on, but there was no <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> So I decided and we were using the entire <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> for the second year. Your contributions can't be duplicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> And same thing with <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> We all know what a great book that is, and what I really appreciate about the whole thing is, number one, that there are no misprints in the book. So that's a great delight. Especially, for people who do not know Sanskrit, for them, there's no difference between the wheat and the germ that comes with it. The translations are very accurate. So it's real scholarship there. And people who were not aware of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they know that if the intellect is so powerful, the spirit must be powerful too. Our library, of course, has several copies, and our bookstore has almost all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All over the world they have given standing order. (laughter)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now other professors you have to assure that higher appreciation. Any scholar will appreciate. Apart from religious point of view, from scholarly point of view, they like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> I think you should maybe some day in the future also put out a grammar, Sanskrit grammar, whether yourself you write or somebody.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> In Europe, Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's a very nice Hungarian boy, he's a translator. He doesn't know English expertly, but I kept talking to him, he was working on translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he'll translate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> He's a Hungarian and he knows Russian also.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> He knows English quite fluently, but he feels not so expert in it. He's developing his expertise for English too. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is engaged in the business of sense gratification. Just like last night millions of men went to see the firework. So the firework as well as the people went to see there, the expenditure was very heavy, I think, total?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned that with all of the cars going and what not, it probably amounted to about ten million dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that petrol. But what was the purpose? The purpose was little sense gratification, "I shall see something illuminating." What was other purpose? No purpose. Simply to satisfy the eyes, to see something illuminating. That is one sense, eyes. Then there are other senses. They also want satisfaction. There are hands, there are legs, there are tongue, eyes, ears, nose. So every one, every one of these senses, they are engaged for sense satisfaction. So this is the life. But that sense satisfaction is differently exhibited for different bodies. Just like this firework, it was interesting to the human being. Human being has got a particular type of body, so it is interested to see the firework. But the cats and dogs, they are not interested. They do not know what is fireworks. They, while we are interested to see the firework, a hog may be interested to eat stool. If he gets some stool somewhere, he'll be interested, than to see the firework. So because he has got a different body, he's interested differently. We are human beings, we are interested differently. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja rightly said, <span class="Italic">deha-yogena dehinām.</span> This sense gratification, varieties, according to the varieties of the body. <span class="Italic">Deha-yogena dehinām.</span> But this is arranged, this different process of sense gratification is arranged <span class="Italic">daivāt,</span> by the superior arrangement. <span class="Italic">Daivāt. Sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā deha-yogena dehinām, sarvatra labhyate daivāt.</span> By the superior arrangement everywhere it is available. Either you become Lord Brahmā or you become a small ant, the process of sense gratification, arrangement is there. (aside) You can come forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> This is Professor Dr. Sukla. He has written a very favorable review on your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. (laughs) Yes, I've seen you. Thank you very much. I'm just explaining that sense gratification, different types of bodies differently... So that is arranged by the superior arrangement. <span class="Italic">Sarvatra labhyate daivāt.</span> So it is available everywhere according to the body arrangement. Prahlāda Mahārāja says... Where is that book, Prahlāda Mahārāja, Seventh Canto? <span class="Italic">Tat-prayāso na kartavyo,</span> don't waste your time for that purpose. <span class="Italic">Tat-prayāso na kartavyo.</span> Why not? <span class="Italic">Yata āyur-vyayaḥ param.</span> Simply wasting the valuable duration of life. <span class="Italic">Yata āyur-vyayaḥ.</span> But practically we see that the whole world is spoiling the life simply for sense gratification, especially at the present moment. <span class="Italic">Yata āyur-vyayaḥ param.</span> You can read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b></div>

<div class="Purp-para">Translation: "Endeavors merely for sense gratification or material happiness through economic development are not to be performed, for they result only in a loss of time and energy, with no actual profit. If one's endeavors are directed towards Kṛṣṇa consciousness, one can surely attain the spiritual platform of self-realization. There is no such benefit from engaging oneself in economic development."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our philosophy, and the whole world is engaged in economic development. So which is better? (laughs) Here it is said <span class="Italic">tat-prayāso na kartavyo.</span> We see, especially in the Western country, they are very busy for economic development, and unless one is engaged... I think that <span class="Italic">Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,</span> they questioned that in India, people being fatalist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They questioned, many people think this is a hindrance to progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is progress? In India still, in so fallen condition, we have got practical experience. If there is some arrangement... Sometimes we arrange Hare Kṛṣṇa festival. Each day not less than twenty thousand, thirty thousand, forty thousand people come. Although these, mostly these foreigners, they are chanting, and we are speaking in English, still, to hear the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they come from remote villages. In Calcutta I have seen. That is natural tendency of Indians. <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmi,</span> anyone who has taken birth in India, naturally Kṛṣṇa conscious. By artificial means, they are being suppressed. Just like this <span class="Italic">Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan,</span> they have questioned that... What they have said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said that there are many thinkers in India who consider that the Hinduism is fatalistic, and therefore it doesn't encourage people to make material progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That economic development. Our <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> practically in Indian civilization, there are so many books of knowledge, but there is no recommendation for starting big, big factories for economic development. You'll find Vyāsadeva has written so many books, each book so valuable, instructive, but still he was condemned. <span class="Italic">Dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90],</span> he dealt with these four subject matter, but not <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Therefore Nārada Muni chastised him, that "You have wasted your time, simply writing on the subject matter of <span class="Italic">dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa, catur varga.</span>" Then, under his instruction, he wrote <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> simply on the glories of the Supreme Lord, without any attempt to write anything about <span class="Italic">dharma artha kāma mokṣa.</span> In the beginning he introduces, gives introduction to his book, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavo 'tra śrīmad-bhāgavate [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, dharma, artha, kāma, mokṣa,</span> they are all <span class="Italic">kaitavas,</span> cheating. These things are thrown away. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this <span class="Italic">kaitava,</span> Śrīdhara Swami gives his commentary, <span class="Italic">atra mokṣa-vāñchan paryantaṁ nirastam.</span> The desire for liberation is also rejected. Simply devotional service to the Lord. That is only business. So our, this propaganda, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is on the basis... It is called <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja begins his teaching that this <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma</span> should be imparted from the very beginning of life. And people are missing this opportunity. They are being allured by other business. The main business they are forgetting, neglecting, and they are being drawn, their attention is drawn, so many sporting, so many economic development, then other <span class="Italic">anarthas,</span> drinking, gambling, slaughterhouse, so on, so on. So this is against human civilization. Therefore if you will give us some chance... Just like you have given. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Loomis(?):</span> Could I ask a question? I look at this room and my senses are gratified by this room, by that painting, by beautiful flowers, by the chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa is pleasing to my ear, and I have to feel that my senses are able to help my spirit, or else there will not be this beauty in this room. But I don't understand very well when sense gratification is helpful and when it is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense gratification is never helpful. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that <span class="Italic">kāmasya nendriya-prītir</span> [SB 1.2.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Sense gratification is required as far as..., as little as possible. Otherwise, not for sense gratification. Just like sleeping. Sleeping is required because this material body requires some rest. But not that we shall sleep twenty-four hours or twenty hours and enjoy, as in this country sometimes they enjoy sleeping. But sleeping is wasting time. So long we shall sleep we cannot do anything good work. Therefore it should be minimized. You cannot avoid sleeping altogether. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is not possible. But it should be accepted to the minimum extent. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> or advancement of spiritual life. Eating, sleeping, sex and defense. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna.</span> They're required. So long we have got this body, we require to eat something, we require to sleep sometimes, we require a little sense gratification, and we require defense. But it should be minimized, not increased. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> In the human life this is possible, this is possible. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. One can conquer over these things, by practice. The more we minimize this <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna,</span> this means we are advanced in spiritual taste.(?) It is practiced. My, my personal life, I don't sleep at night. And nowadays, at most, one hour. Yes. But I take rest in the daytime, at least two to three hours. So it is not that I am sleeping one hour. I sleep three to four hours total. But if practiced, it can be reduced, practiced. We see in the life of Gosvāmīs. About them, it is said: <span class="Italic">nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. They conquered over sleeping, eating. If we conquer over eating, then we can conquer over sleeping and other things also. If we can control over this tongue, then we can control over the other senses very easily. That is a fact. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung, <span class="Italic">tar madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati, tā 'ke jetā koṭhina saṁsāre.</span> Of all our senses the tongue is very, very prominent. So the first thing in spiritual advancement, the first thing is to control the tongue. In the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> also it is said <span class="Italic">sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ</span> [BRS. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> Our present senses are unable to understand <span class="Italic">sri kṛṣṇa nāmādi,</span> the holy name of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Ādi,</span> beginning from His name, <span class="Italic">nāma,</span> then <span class="Italic">guṇa,</span> qualities, then pastimes, then form. So people cannot understand the form of the Lord because they are not practiced to devotional service. They are more or less impersonalists. They cannot imagine that God has His form like us, because they are not <span class="Italic">sevonmukha. Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi.</span> Not to speak of the form, they cannot understand what is the holy name of the Lord, why they are chanting, what is the benefit. They cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Ataḥ śrī kṛṣṇa nāmādi na bhaved grāhyam indriyaiḥ</span> [BRS. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> The present senses cannot appreciate. It has to be purified. That purification begins from the tongue. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau.</span> Then God reveals. When we chant the holy name of the Lord, purified, that is <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhakti</span> means to become purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">. Nirmalam </span>means completely cleansed of all dirty things. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti. </span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means to engage the senses, purified senses, in the service of the Lord. At the present moment, in conditioned stage, our senses are not purified. Therefore we are very, very anxious to engage the senses for sense gratification. And when they will be purified, then these senses will be engaged for the service of Hṛṣīkeśa. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣikeṇa hṛṣīkeśa sevanam.</span> God's another name is Hṛṣīkeśa, master of the senses. Actually, we have got these senses. Suppose this hand is also one of the senses, to touch. We are claiming it is my hand, but it is not my hand. It is Kṛṣṇa's hand. Kṛṣṇa has given us to use it. Just like this room is not my room. They have given me for my use. Similarly, this body, actually, it is made by Kṛṣṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">It is a machine manufactured by the material nature under the order of Kṛṣṇa. So actually it is not my body, it is Kṛṣṇa's body. Kṛṣṇa has given us. He has given you a particular type of body, He has given me a particular type of body, so many. <span class="Italic">Yantra,</span> machine. Just like on a machine, motorcar, we sit down and travel here and there. So we wanted to travel in a certain way so we require some machine, and Kṛṣṇa has given us this machine manufactured by material nature. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ suyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> So Kṛṣṇa is within the core of heart of everyone. He knows what I want. He's giving us facilities. We wanted to enjoy this material world, and He's still giving direction, "All right, you want to get this facility, sit down on it and travel as you like." So we are getting different machines. Sometimes the human body machine, sometimes dog machine, sometimes cat machine, sometimes demigod machine. We are desiring all these things. American machine, Indian machine. When you are in Indian machine you are thinking "I am Indian. My business is to satisfy Indian interests." You Americans are thinking "This is American machine; it should be used for America's benefit." These are <span class="Italic">upādhi. Upādhi</span> means designation. Neither I am Indian nor American nor cat nor dog. But as soon as I get a particular type of body, I think that I am cat, I am dog, I am Indian, I am America, I am black, I am white, this. This is our position. And people are struggling on this understanding, "I am this body." So long we think like that, "I am this body," we are no better than cats and dogs. He is also thinking "I am this body." Is it not? What do you think, Mr. Sukla? If I think I am this body, the dog is also thinking "I am this body," then where is the difference between the dog and me? What do you think, Mr... How shall I address you?</div>

Yesterday you observed this great festival under this impression that "I am American. I must observe this independence." Is it not? What was the meaning of this festival?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is thinking that "I am American." So if a human being is thinking "I am American," "Indian," or something like that, and if a dog is thinking "I am dog," then where is the difference between the mentalities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Of course, both, perhaps, are victim of some kind of illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is illusion. That we are trying to describe. But this is going on. As the dog is thinking, "I am dog," the human being is also thinking that "I am American," "I am Indian," or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Then, perhaps, there is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No difference. That is described in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.

Everyone knows what is the composition: the bones, the flesh, the blood, the urine, the stool and so on, so on. The body, what is the composition? This is the composition. So if I identify with these bones, flesh, blood, muscle, veins, and stool, urine, so I am a living entity, I am all these bones and flesh and blood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Loomis:</span> Is it better to have a human body as a machine to use than a cat's body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly, in the sense that you can utilize for higher purposes. Just like you have got this human form of body. Therefore you are sitting here to hear me. The dog has no such facility. The dog has got the same legs, hands or mouth and tongue, and so on, so on, in a different way. But it has no capacity to hear about spiritual advancement of life. Therefore the human body should be engaged not simply for sense gratification. <span class="Italic">Kāmasya nendriya-prītir</span> [SB 1.2.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Jīvasya tattva-jijñāsā.</span> This is the business, <span class="Italic">tattva-jijñāsā.

That is only, because you have got this body, material body, it requires little rest, little sense gratification, little eating, little sleeping. We don't say stop it completely. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihārasya,</span> as far as it is required. As little as possible. That is spiritual advancement. If we make our progressive life engaged in understanding Kṛṣṇa instead of devoting in these unnecessary things, that is real life. That is real human life. The Vedic civilization is that. We find Vyāsadeva writing so exalted books, but life was very simple. People are, now in the modern civilization, people are accustomed only to the comforts of the body. Not for spiritual advance. That is the defect of modern civilization. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, no matter what material body you have, by material nature given you, one of the most predominating features of material life is pain. I want to address myself to this question, because in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we frequently face this problem. We have the pain of, for example, if you do <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> that's a pain to deprive your body of sense gratification. If you don't have sleep, you have to force yourself. If you have sickness, mental disturbances, so many things, then there's the other kind of pain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is being explained, that we don't want to stop sleeping, but minimize it. That is being already explained. We don't say complete negation. No. <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihārasya.</span> Simply sleep as little as possible. Not that to take, just like in the Western countries, they take sleeping as enjoyment. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They call it beauty rest. In Hawaii we went by a Beautyrest Mattress store. They call it beauty rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not for beauty rest. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> There's a kind of pain also, like when your false ego, when somebody tells you to do something or yells at you or gives you instruction. We all have this propensity to try and lord it over. When that's being denied, we feel a sense of pain, we feel like something, you know, dejected in our service. The tendency is to want to be angry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to be trained up under proper spiritual master. You cannot work whimsically. Then it will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Should we always endeavor in spite of pain to push ourselves in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no pain. It is painful in the beginning, but... Everything. If you take some medicine, it is bitter, it is painful, but if it helps to cure disease, we must take it. "Because the medicine is bitter, I'll not take it." That is not sense. If you want to be cured from the disease, even the medicine is bitter, you must take. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> means things we are going to accept may be not very pleasing, but still we have to do it. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> We take bitter medicine just to cure our existence. Similarly, at the present moment, our existence is impure. Therefore we have to accept birth, death, old age and disease on account of impure existence. Otherwise, we are spirit soul, we are eternal, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are not in eternal existence, we are temporary existence. We have got this body, it will be finished. Then we have to accept another body, <span class="Italic">tatha dehāntara praptir.</span> Then again you live in that body for some time, and again the body is finished. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this is going on. This is impure stage of our existence. So we have to purify it. Therefore to purify it <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> required. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyaṁ yena śuddhyed sattvam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> required. That <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> has to be given lesson, trained up. <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> system, to understand the value of life. These things are lacking in the present civilization, but it is essential. Without this, there is no meaning of human life. Then it is cats' and dogs' life. <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">. </span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">So just we are trying to save men from this <span class="Italic">go-kharaḥ</span> civilization. Therefore it is not very appealing to the general mass of people. But still we have seen yesterday that as soon as we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, everyone is attracted, everyone. You have seen yesterday? The drunkard, he was also attracted, and the child was attracted, the gray(?) gentleman, he was also attracted, within the park. The child was dancing and the drunkard was dancing. Therefore this is the only means to elevate the modern men to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Have the writings of Vidyāpati come to attention, and if they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very higher, not for ordinary persons. Vidyāpati's writing is meant for realized souls, not ordinary. Ordinary, they will take as love affairs between girls and boys. Therefore it is not for them. Those who are already advanced, liberated, then these love affairs of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā, they will be discussed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> Is there any plan of bringing those things out, publishing them, his poems and translations?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not for ordinary. Cāṇḍīdāsa, Vidyāpati. Caitanya Mahāprabhu used to discuss Jayadeva's books, Vidyāpati's books, very confidentially amongst a few devotees. Not publicly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Sukla:</span> So you think they might be misused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are being misused. They take Kṛṣṇa as debauch. They do not understand. Therefore the Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">līlā</span> with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they are described in the Tenth Canto. That is also middle of Tenth Canto, and nine cantos required to understand Kṛṣṇa, beginning with <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So that is the Absolute Truth. These things should be discussed in the beginning. Then when one is fully convinced that Kṛṣṇa has nothing to do with this material world, as Śaṅkarācārya said, <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇaḥ para avyaktāt, avyaktāt anna sambhava.</span> This material world is a production... [break] It has to be purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> When it is <span class="Italic">nirmalam,</span> then it is first-class. The first process is <span class="Italic">nirmalam. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam, arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> This process is first-class. Not all of a sudden jump over. This literature, that is (indistinct), that should be kept in reserve for persons who are already liberated. Otherwise it will be misunderstood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Going back to this sense question, where do you think the scheme of art fits into Kṛṣṇa conscious life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Art?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, like painting, or music, or literature, poetry, like that. Because the problem is that they, if one devotes oneself to these things, they are full-time things, they take all your energy and time. And so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotion means to engage your energy and time for Kṛṣṇa. Anyway you do that, that is utilized. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinir... tat-paratvena. Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa sevanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you can serve Kṛṣṇa by your hand, by painting about Kṛṣṇa, that is service. If you chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, if you hear the chanting, that is also service. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇu,</span> about Lord Viṣṇu, Kṛṣṇa. That is the beginning. Kṛṣṇa is the reservoir of pleasure, <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'byāsāt.</span> So these things are producing <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> If it is in connection with Kṛṣṇa, then it is service. (aside:) So, Pālikā, you can take these fruits, cut into pieces and distribute it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what if, ah, for instance, I'm too fallen to closely follow the regulative principles and I find myself in that way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Too fallen to follow the regulative principles is like saying a diseased man is too diseased to take medicine. So it's actually in our own self interest. We have to become enlightened, to understand what our real interest is. <span class="Italic">Yajña vai viṣṇu.</span> Now we are thinking that our real interest is to gratify the senses. This is perishable. When we come to the understanding of <span class="Italic">ātmā, ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> then we understand that our real self interest is to follow these regulative principles. As Prabhupāda said, in the beginning it may be painful, undoubtedly, because we are, for so many lifetimes addicted to sense gratification, but gradually more and more <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> when the heart becomes cleansed from the dirty misidentification with this gross and subtle material body, gradually more and more it becomes favorable (indistinct). Kṛṣṇa says, "Be happy by this sacrifice." Therefore the sacrifice must be joy-producing, <span class="Italic">ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</span> Simply that because we're presently in diseased condition, it may appear to be displeasing. Prabhupāda gives the example of someone who has jaundice. In the jaundice state, when you take sugar it appears very bitter. The perception is very bitter. But everyone knows that sugar is sweet. So in the same way, the regulative principles are naturally painful for someone who is irregular. For.... Engaged in bodily identification of life. But gradually it becomes more and more pleasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> When we have Kṛṣṇa conscious (indistinct) struggling for(indistinct). It has to be a struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is struggle? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, dance and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> (devotee cheers)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that struggle? You don't want to take it. Say that. Where is struggle? To take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> nice <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> is struggle? (laughs)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he'll sleep. Just as your spiritual master will do for (indistinct) everything (indistinct). It is not magic. Kṛṣṇa, when He advised Arjuna, He never said that "Arjuna, I'm your friend, God, I shall do everything (indistinct). You don't fight." Did He say? "You have to fight!" That's Kṛṣṇa's mercy. Not that by spiritual master's mercy (indistinct). You have to struggle. You have to follow the rules and regulations. Yes, what does He say?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"> "This knowledge is the king of education, the most secret of all secrets. It is the purest knowledge, and because it gives direct perception of the self by realization, it is the perfection of religion. It is everlasting, and it is joyfully performed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> So by struggling to overcome our senses, we can please you and obtain your mercy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda mentions in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> in the Third Canto, that a yogi is recommended to take foodstuffs, half as much as he desires, one quarter water, one quarter air, one quarter foodstuff. Is that fully recommended for a person in the the Kṛṣṇa consciousness society? If so, how can you be (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The basic principle is that-Prabhupāda mentioned earlier in this afternoon's talk-that if you can control the tongue, especially eating habits, then you'll be able to conquer other things such as sleep. Not only sleep, but also overeating produces other problems like sex desire. <span class="Italic">Vāco vegaṁ manasaḥ krodha-vegaṁ jihvā-vegam udaropastha-vegam.</span> So <span class="Italic">jihva,</span> the tongue and the belly, <span class="Italic">udara, upastha,</span> genital, one straight line, like this. So there's a correlation. If one overindulges in eating, then it becomes very difficult also to conquer sex desire, which is the main attraction, or bondage within this material world, not only for the human being but for every living entity. So the principle is that if you don't overeat it will become easier for you to conquer all the senses, as Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, tongue is the most formidable of all the senses. <span class="Italic">Tāra madhye jihvā ati, lobhamoy sudur...</span> always lusting after more and more. Never satisfied. So we have to become sufficiently enlightened to regulate eating habits. This is done by taking <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> at regular times, and gradually, intelligently you can see what you actually require. Not that everyone will require the same amount. Just like there's a plate of food so one person is big or one person is small. An elephant and an ant, both of them have different quotas. So everyone has a particular quota of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> they should take. Gradually by practice apart from this (indistinct) is required. It's common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There are two, two functions in the tongue, one is (indistinct) and one is (indistinct)? So which one (indistinct). Preaching is a form of <span class="Italic">tapasya?</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the different austerities. The austerity of the tongue, the austerity of the mind, the austerity of the body. It is described in the Seventeenth Chapter and the, and the austerity of the tongue, of speech,</div>
<div class="Verse">anudvega-karaṁ vākyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>satyaṁ priya-hitaṁ ca yat<br class="calibre2"/>svādhyāyābhyasanaṁ caiva<br class="calibre2"/>vāṅ-mayam tapa ucyate</div>
<div class="Purp-para">It's an austerity, <span class="Italic">tapa.</span> Austerity of speech consists of speaking truthfully, and beneficially, and then avoiding speech that offends. One should also recite the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> regularly. So preaching is also control of the tongue. So our philosophy is that control doesn't mean that you stop. It's not possible. Can you stop eating? Can you stop sleeping? Can you stop different activities of going here and going there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) everyone. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But that everything should be done in relationship to Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will become purified. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeśa hṛṣīkeṇa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate.</span> When the senses are engaged for Kṛṣṇa's satisfaction, then they're no longer... The senses are compared to the sharp teeth of (indistinct). (indistinct) sharp teeth are naturally very dangerous. But when engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, the shark teeth, they're broken. So they can't feel any trouble. Although we are using the senses which is the cause of bondage, these senses employed in Kṛṣṇa's service, they no longer become a source of bondage, but of liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Sanskrit) Serpent is dangerous, so long he has got the fangs. (indistinct) If the fang is taken away that means he's no more dangerous. So (indistinct). But if I am sure that his fangs are taken away (indistinct). Senses are dangerous, it is compared with the serpent. (Sanskrit) But if you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness that (Sanskrit) the fangs are no more existing therefore it is no more dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is it true or not true that Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta said that failure is the pillar of success and (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know exactly if Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Prabhupāda has used this saying....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Failure is the pillar of success. But generally speaking, to paraphrase it, it means that we should learn from our mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is success. If we learn our failure and try to rectify it, that is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I asked Prabhupāda the other day, because Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, "Forget the past, it sleeps and never the future dream at all. Live with times that are of thee, and progress thee shall call." So I asked Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it possible to forget the past? Śrīla Prabhupāda said, "No, that would not be possible, but we can think like this, that 'I have done so many foolish things,' and rectify it. Not that we should remain fools. Then what would be the value of our experience? Just like a child, he can put his finger in the fan and it hurts. So then he learns not to do it again. But if he's so dull-headed that again and again he puts his finger in the fan... Basically our experience from the material world should be <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That the material world is simply a place of misery. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhī-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> That we should perceive the miseries of birth and death, disease and old age. That should be our experience in the material world. From this we should aspire for real happiness. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So this... It explains also in the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Instruction</span> that the man who may see others stealing and see others also put in jail and punished for stealing, he may have been caught himself and punished for stealing but yet he goes out and steals again. That this (indistinct) again and again. Is this a symptom of the cause (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's called <span class="Italic">durācara,</span> misbehavior. So atonement, according to Śukadeva Gosvāmī, is not simply repenting and saying, "Oh, I'm sorry." But becoming intelligent. Atonement means coming to the platform of real intelligence. That intelligence, "Why I am becoming implicated in this material world, in so many ways which will simply produce more and more suffering for myself?" Just like if he steals, he knows he goes to prison, so he knows it beforehand, he's not ignorant of the fact. In this instance, one.... He knows that if he steals, he goes to prison. So in the same way we should become intelligent and should understand the laws of nature, the laws of God. That's <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Inquiry what is the real nature, what is the real nature of Brahman, how Brahman has manifested this material world and how it's going on. Then become intelligent, act for your own self-interest, become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is explained that the intelligence is the next door neighbor of the soul, can you explain exactly what that means, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His question is that the intelligence, sometimes you've gone like this, I've seen, you say that the soul and the intelligence are like that, that the intelligence is very close to the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) the relationship between the intelligence, working in the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is above intelligence. This is the relationship. Intelligence is above the mind, and soul is above the intelligence. Senses, then mind, then intelligence, then the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, subtle (?) matter (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Indriyāṇi parāṇy āhur [Bg. </span>3.42]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Manasas tu parā buddhir yo buddheḥ paratas tu saḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when you engage yourself in soul's activities, then gradually your intelligence, mind, senses, become spiritualized, or original. Then material activities stop. At the present moment without (indistinct) spiritually (indistinct) we are acting on the platform of gross senses. But if we begin our activities from the opposite side, from soul side, then everything becomes spiritualized. But the question of giving up the senses, no, it has to be purified. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> Senses (indistinct) it should be purified. At the present moment, on account of material conception of life everything is polluted with material ideas. So when it will be spiritualised, that is perfect. But instead of working uselessly, if we use our legs for going to the temple then it is spiritualized work. And instead of going to the cinema, if we go and see Deity then it is spiritual eyes. Instead of going to the restaurant, hotel, if we take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> so then you spiritualize your tongue. Instead of talking nonsense, if you talk about Kṛṣṇa, then it is properly utilizing the tongue. In this way we have to practice. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhe kṛṣṇa sambandhe yukta-vairāgyam ucyate.</span> Somebody is trying to stop sense activity. That is not possible.

Naṣṭo mohaḥ smṛtir labdhā tvat-prasādān madhusūdana.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is wanted. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa says, "You fight." He hesitated. "How can I fight? To kill my grandfather, my teacher? To kill my brother? My nephew? And so on, so on, so on. What You are advising, Kṛṣṇa, I cannot do." Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was talked, and after learning he says, "Yes, <span class="Italic">kariṣye vacanaṁ tava.</span>" (indistinct) This is perfection. He remained the same soldier. In the beginning, he was declining to fight, but at the end, he has agreed, "Yes." In the beginning it was "No." And when he was perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious, it is "Yes." The materialist person, they are accustomed to say, "No." "No, God." When you become "Yes, God," then you are perfect. <span class="Italic">Jñānīs</span> are "No, God." The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are "No, God," yogis are "No, God," everyone, "No, God." Only the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> "Yes, God!" Yes. So that is perfect. This morning one Indian gentleman was talking about this impersonal, what was his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, some gentleman was asking the question in the morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct) interpretation, that one person is interpreting in this way and another in that way, so they're saying they feel like if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they should interpret different way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What was the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just... Explain to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There was an Indian man there and he was saying that, you were presenting, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the philosophy very nicely, but there are others who are presenting it in an impersonal way. And they are able through the scripture to support what they say. Prabhupāda (indistinct) now in our (indistinct) you can't actually substantiate that God is impersonal, because Kṛṣṇa is a person speaking to Arjuna, so where is the question of impersonal? (indistinct) So Prabhupāda said it's because they're speculating and cheating, that they're interpreting it in some devious manner, rather than taking what Kṛṣṇa said, literally, as (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, I have given some thought to that. I found that whenever you take an impersonal view, it becomes a pure intellectual exercise, devoid of any feeling. And if you bring feeling into that, it becomes personal. Like, I don't believe that anything can survive without feeling. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is clearly said, <span class="Italic">bhagavān uvāca.</span> It is never said Brahman <span class="Italic">uvāca.</span> (laughter) People have no eyes to see. The absolute truth is realized <span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> But in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is never said Paramātmā <span class="Italic">uvāca.</span> (laughter) Or Brahman <span class="Italic">uvāca. Bhagavān uvāca!</span> Vyāsadeva, He does not say <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa uvāca,</span> because Kṛṣṇa will be taken, misunderstood. Therefore (Vyāsadeva) directly says, <span class="Italic">śrī bhagavān uvāca.</span> So where is impersonal? There is no question of impersonal. He clearly says <span class="Italic">bhagavān. Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Bhagavān says, "I am everything." So where is imperson? How they can bring in impersonal at all? It is simply dragging (?) the matter. This impersonal has killed India's Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, the example is that Śaṅkarācārya, who was of course...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya, he advised <span class="Italic">bhaja govindam, bhaja govindam,</span> "Hey you rascal, whatever I have said, you just..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> On the one hand he reached the height of that intellectual exercise, at the same time he realized that <span class="Italic">bhaja govindam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He is correct in the study. Because his mission was to stop atheism. At that time India was full of Buddhistic philosophy. Atheism. So his preaching was to stop Buddhism. Therefore, the Buddhists are <span class="Italic">śūnyavādis.</span> So he said, "No, it is not <span class="Italic">śūnya.</span> That is Brahman. This material world is false, (indistinct)." Lord Buddha said everything is false. He said, "No, the material world is false, Brahman is false, <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span> But he did not give any further information of Brahman. But at last he said <span class="Italic">brahma me govindaṁ brahmate bhaja govindam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There's a very nice story about this illusion. That once he was walking and someone who knew that Śaṅkarācārya preached this illusion business, was riding on an elephant, so he asked his driver, "Chase Śaṅkarācārya." And of course he did and Śaṅkarācārya started running. So this man said, "Why are you running, since this is illusion?" And he said, "So is my running." (laughter) He said, "So is my running, that's also an illusion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But sometimes the impersonalists, they say, Prabhupāda, that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness is just the beginning platform, that after Kṛṣṇa consciousness then one can come to impersonal realization. They say that in the scriptures only <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and a few scriptures teach about Kṛṣṇa but the rest of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> don't even talk about Kṛṣṇa's name. So, therefore, this impersonalism is higher realization, but one comes to it, after <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There are <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> there are so many names described. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one has not understood Kṛṣṇa by studying <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> then he has not studied <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is very confidential. Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">?</span> If one has studied <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> but has not understood Kṛṣṇa, then his labor is useless. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one is actually <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> then he (indistinct). Śaṅkarācārya said <span class="Italic">bhaja govindam, bhaja govindam.</span> That is real knowledge. But if one says that in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> you don't find Kṛṣṇa's name, then he has not studied <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> The actual purpose of studying <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> means to understand Kṛṣṇa. If one has not understood Kṛṣṇa, then <span class="Italic">śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> They have simply labored for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Also this, another aspect was answered, the Vedic literature, all that we have today, is not a complete literature. We assume that perhaps some part of the literature has never been copied and was probably lost. So if His name doesn't occur in certain portion of <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> it doesn't mean that the name didn't occur in the <span class="Italic">Vedas. </span>This is something that people have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa's name is very confidential. In the <span class="Italic">Atharva Veda,</span> there is name, there is.... Jīva Gosvāmī has quoted from <span class="Italic">Atharva Veda.</span> There is Kṛṣṇa's name. And this, the best scholar of <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> (indistinct) he says, <span class="Italic">sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇa,</span> Śaṅkarācārya. Then other <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> they have supported Kṛṣṇa's teachings, just like Rāmānujācārya, and (indistinct) he has quoted Vedic quotation, every <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> So one has to learn the real <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> then he'll find, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is mentioned," (Sanskrit). Everywhere is Kṛṣṇa's name. But one must be actually scholar in <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> then he'll find, "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is mentioned in the beginning, in the middle, and at the end."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In the glorifications of <span class="Italic">Ṛg Veda,</span> (indistinct) example of glorifications of Kṛṣṇa there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is glorification of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Whenever Kṛṣṇa is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> He's mentioned as the Supreme. Some people, some scholars say, "Well, so many other demigods are mentioned far more often than Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa's mentioned to be the supermost. From the <span class="Italic">Atharva Veda,</span> (Sanskrit). "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Either you accept this Kṛṣṇa's statement, or you reject Kṛṣṇa. But He says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> What do you want more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, Prabhupādajī, if anyone has gone to <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and if he is still bothered by the historical evidence, I don't think he has read <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So we should never really be bothered by this question of historical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have concentrated on <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> This movement-when I registered this association, so when I wrote "Kṛṣṇa consciousness," some friend said, "Why don't you write 'God consciousness'?" But no, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are particularly preaching Kṛṣṇa's teaching. Kṛṣṇa is God, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> But if you think that there is another God then you may do your business. We are concerned with Kṛṣṇa. That's all. We cannot allow any interpretation of Kṛṣṇa. That is our (indistinct). (aside:) Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> There is a Swami, Gangesvaranandaji, (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (indistinct) books that Kṛṣṇa's name in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kṛṣṇa's name in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has clearly (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> The Māyāvādīs say that <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> is impersonal, and (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Vedānta...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know what is <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> (indistinct) In the beginning of <span class="Italic">Vedānta, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> "Now try to inquire about this Supreme, (indistinct) Brahman." The next verse is <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> Brahman is there, from whom everything emanates. So now, what is that thing from which everything emanates? What is the nature of that thing? That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhāgavatam</span> is the real explanation of <span class="Italic">Veda. Brahma-sūtra,</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">mahasyam brahma-sūtrānāṁ vedasya parividyatam</span> (?), this <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, vedasya parividyatam, (indistinct) avyayam, brahma-sūtrasya (?) uvaca,</span> by Vyāsadeva himself. Vyāsadeva is the writer of <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> so he's writing himself under the instruction of Nārada. So to understand <span class="Italic">Vedānta,</span> you have to study <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> He's explained <span class="Italic">janmādy asya [SB 1.1.1].</span> Brahman is the original source of everything. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ.</span> So what is the nature? <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca...</span> (end)</div>
