<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> Mr. (indistinct) has made very good progress, because before he was always teaching impersonalist <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā,</i> and now you see he is wearing a <i class="calibre3">dhotī</i>, he's coming to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, he's coming for <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i> classes, and he teaches personalist <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>. But he still thinks a little bit that maybe above there is something impersonalism. But there is good progress. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.2.11<span class="Italic">]</span>. <i class="calibre3">Brahman, Paramātmā...</i> He understands English?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Brahman, Paramātmā</i>, and <i class="calibre3">Bhagavān</i>, last stage. First realization impersonal Brahman, then localized <i class="calibre3">Paramātmā</i>, and then Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Conversation">(Jyotirmayī translates into French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> Jyotirmayī, perhaps you can explain what Mr. Priest's qualifications are.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> Yeah, Mr. (indistinct) is a priest, and he has been for a long time in India, a Christian priest, and he was very glad to know what you are doing here. Kṛṣṇa consciousness was...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In India, where did you stay?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> In Poona.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Poona, oh. How long you were there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Twenty-five years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, then you are Indian. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Half of my time, yes, I was in India, half my life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Twenty-five years in a place means you domicile. Yes, naturally.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Did you come to Poona?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Once I went. One friend took me there. I stayed in that Gujarati hotel, near the station I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes, not far.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Poona is nice place. Climate is nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> For studies it's a beautiful place, and particularly for Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, there are many good scholars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Many scholars, many institutions, and also the society is rich.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Maharastrian, they are educated, advanced.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> How do you find your disciples here in Europe?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I shouldn't ask personal question.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, it is not personal. It is..., Caitanya Mahāprabhu's cult is so nice that it can attract anyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It does, it does.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Not only here in Europe-in Africa, in Canada, in China, in Japan, everywhere. In, what is called, Philippines. We have got everywhere center-Australia.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> In Bombay also you have got?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, yes, Bombay just now we have got a very big place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And we are constructing a big hotel, strictly vegetarian <i class="calibre3">prasādam.</i> We are at Juhu quarter. (someone enters room) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Jaya</i>. So you can give him a chair, this one. You can come forward here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> You have been to India? You've worked there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, he was twenty-five years there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Twenty-five years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He is Indian. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I was... I mean I am still a <i class="calibre3">bhakta</i> of Kṛṣṇa, but not..., of the old tradition of Maharastra the (indistinct) of Pāṇḍarapura, Viṭhobā.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kṛṣṇa, that Viṭhṭhala, Viṭhṭhala. Viṭhṭhala, there is... So they are Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> And it's the main... (indistinct) center of Maharastra.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Pāṇḍarapura.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> When I went to India twenty-five years ago, I first studied for four years at this pilgrimage.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What was your subject matter studying?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I was studying for a thesis, a doctorate thesis, this pilgrimage, the story of the pilgrimage and everything of the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> pilgrimage. And as you know, it was one of the main <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> tradition in Maharastra, Orissa, Jñāneśvara.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tukārāma, Tukārāma.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Tukārāma.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I have proceeded to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tukārāma is in the line of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That's right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He was initiated by Caitanya. His <i class="calibre3">avanga, avanga,</i> that is written there, he was initiated by Caitanya.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It's a great <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> tradition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.55]. Find out. If we want to know God, then we have to accept the process recommended by God. That is <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti<br class="calibre2"/>yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tato māṁ tattvato jñātvā<br class="calibre2"/>viśate tad-anantaram<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.55]</div>
<div class="Conversation">"One can understand the Supreme Personality as He is only by devotional service. And when one is in full consciousness of the Supreme Lord by such devotion, he can enter into the kingdom of God."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So in another place also it is said, <i class="calibre3">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.65]<i class="calibre3">, mām evaiṣyasi, asaṁśaya. </i>"If you want to enter in the kingdom of God, always think of Me," <i class="calibre3">man-manā</i>, "and you just become My devotee and worship Me and offer your obeisances." These four principles, it is not difficult. To achieve the kingdom of God is not at all difficult. It is very easy. Anyone can go. But they are not prepared to accept the process. That is their misfortune. Otherwise, always thinking of God. We are thinking something, but the thinking should be turned towards God. That is our teaching. They are always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. So by uttering the word Kṛṣṇa, immediately you think of Kṛṣṇa. This is the process. It is not difficult at all. And you can always think of, just like these boys have been taught, walking on the street, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... Just like we have got this. I am talking with you, but two minutes I talk with you, as soon as I stop, I chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma... What is the difficulty? It is simply practice. No difficulty. And simply by chanting the holy name of Kṛṣṇa, everyone can see how these young boys and girls, they are not very old, they have taken to it quite young, but they have forgotten everything. They do not go to cinema, do not go to hotel, no dancing. Dancing they have got-Kṛṣṇa dancing, always. Painting they have got, singing they have got, arts, literature. We have got eighty books like this, four hundred pages. Pure life-no meat eating, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling. Finished. And it is guaranteed if you remain in this attitude, Kṛṣṇa says that "Surely you come back to me." What is the second line? <i class="calibre3">Man-manā</i>...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b> <i class="calibre3">Mām evaiṣyasi yuktvaivam ātmānaṁ mat-parāyaṇaḥ</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> In another place it is said <i class="calibre3">asaṁśaya,</i> that is in the Eighteenth Chapter. So to go back to home, back to Godhead, is very easy, but people will not take to it. They are stubborn; they will stick here, the miserable life, material life. This is the difficulty. Otherwise, God can be achieved very easily. <i class="calibre3">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 18.65]. Four things.</div>
<div class="Verse">yoginām api sarveṣāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mad-gatenāntarātmanā<br class="calibre2"/>śraddhāvān bhajate yo māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sa me yukta(tamo mataḥ)<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.47]</div>
<div class="Conversation">The first-class yogis. Actually no education required. Simply God has given us the tongue and the ear. So it's Hare Kṛṣṇa, tongue, and hear with the ear. <i class="calibre3">Śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhir:</i> by hearing, the sound enters into the heart. In this way you become purified, mind is cleansed, <i class="calibre3">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Cc. Antya 20.12]. It is very scientific and very easy. And we are recommending-"we" means Caitanya Mahāprabhu-He says that "You chant the name of God." Now, if somebody thinks "Kṛṣṇa is Hindu God, why shall I chant?" it doesn't matter. You chant your conception of God. What is the name of God in Christianity? Is there any name?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">French Man:</b> Jehovah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Jehovah?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">French Man:</b> He has no name in Christianity.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then take this name. (laughter) If you have no name, then take this name. Where is the harm? And they are taking Hare Kṛṣṇa, what is the harm? Every religion believes..., not believes; it is fact that there is God. Or any religion will deny the existence of God, is there any religion? I don't think. Is there any religion?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Buddhist religion?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But you know, it's true, but you have got so many idea of God according to your own spiritual temperament.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, God is one. There cannot be many ideas of God. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> You have got many idea of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, many ideas, that means he does not know what is God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Because anyhow, when we say "God," we have to put into words, intellectual words, what is an experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> And this experience is different for many people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You experience... Because your knowledge is imperfect, therefore your experience is also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But who is to say...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is... Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> ...what is a perfect experience?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Even we are imperfect, with our... As far as our knowledge goes, generally, just like the Christians, they say "God is great." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That is rather the Muslims.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh? That is Muslim.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Allah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Allah akbar</i>. So what is the conception of God of the Christian?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> As you said, it's impersonal, trans-personal, what we explain by that Trinity. It's a relationship. It's a pure relationship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, relationship means that He must be a person.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why? Otherwise how you can...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It is beyond a person.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Beyond the person... Just like we have got experience: when you call relation, then relation means we consider master and servant. This is also one relation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So relation means two person-one master, one servant. Then relation, friendly relation, that is also person. Then relation, father and son, that is also relation. Then husband and wife, that is also relation. So relation cannot be used without person.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but what we don't... We don't say that God is object of relation but He is the relation itself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that, relation itself? Explain.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It's when you are two together, when the master...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then two together means person. As soon as you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes, but not God. God is beyond relation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why? Your experience of relation, as soon as a relation two, the two persons.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, why not? This is your practical experience. How you can say no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> You see, I have got relation...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We are two person.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> ...with you. But I am not in relation with God, because God is relationship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, when you say relation, why not that relation as we have got relation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Certainly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> As soon as you say relation, you cannot change it otherwise.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes, but I don't make God the object of relationship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then what...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Because I call my relationship God, not the object of relationship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> A relation with who?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Relation with anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> That is God?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That is God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> He thinks relationship with anything means God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anything?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Yes, anything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Anything, anybody. When you are here, when I am (indistinct) relationship with you, then God is. You understand? But I cannot restrict God to a person with whom I could enter...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But in your Bible you say, "O Father." Relation is father and son. Why do you say in the Bible "O Father, give us our daily bread"? So that you make relation with God as father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But not anything, but father. As the father gives the maintenance, bread, so you go to God in that relationship, "Father, give us our daily bread." Just like the child asks the father, "Father, give me something to eat." So this is clear relationship father and son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">French Man:</b> No, it's a very complicated system, the system for all these things in the (indistinct) of this country. There are two main conceptions-the Oriental conception of the Orthodox Church and the Western...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, we are not talking of any particular church. We are just trying to understand the word relation. If you go to particular church, then another will give another church, another will give another church. But we are trying to understand the word relationship. So in the Bible it is clearly said, "O Father," so the relation is father and son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why do you say? It is said in the Bible. Why do you say no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> You have to... I am not in relationship with any church or any dogma. This is what I have in my own experience, and I cannot speak of what others have experienced but what is my own experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, God's relationship should be universal, not that... It may be a different relationship. Just like the relationship between husband and wife, relationship between father and son, relationship between friend and friend, relationship between master and servant, so these are relationship. We understand relationship means this. And it is particularly said in the Bible, "O Father." That means the relationship is as between father and son. So there is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You say no, but any man will understand that. You may have your own opinion, that is a different thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But we have to have the opinion which we experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that experience? You ask, "Father, give us our daily bread," and that is experience. God is giving everyone maintenance. That is our actual relationship. In the <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> also it is said, <i class="calibre3">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān</i> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<i class="calibre3">. </i>That is the God. God is also a person as you are person, I am person, but He is the chief person. <i class="calibre3">Nityo nityānām</i>, the chief, the Supreme. In the dictionary it is said Supreme Being. We are all beings, and He is Supreme Being. How He is supreme? <i class="calibre3">Eka</i>, that one; God is one. <i class="calibre3">Bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān</i>. He supplies the necessities of everyone's life. That is very good experience, we are getting everything from God. And the Christians also pray, "Give us our daily bread." So I don't find any difference between the statement in the <i class="calibre3">Vedas</i> and the Bible. God is the Supreme Person, and you make relationship with Him any way-as master and servant, as friend and friend, as father and son, or as husband and wife. So somehow or other we are related with God, this way or that way. The husband also maintains the wife.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I don't think so. I mean...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, that is your personal opinion. But...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Not opinion; experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So what is that experience? Tell me what is that experience?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That God is beyond all our experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then what is your experience? You have no experience. If it is beyond your experience, then you have no experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Personally, of course, but...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then you cannot explain. You cannot, because you have no experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But if you know what you can't explain...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, if you can't explain means you do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> You don't think an illusion (indistinct) relationship.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, not illusion. If you cannot explain, that means you do not know. If you know, you must explain. That is knowing, that is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but that knowledge is very (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then you cannot preach. As a priest you cannot preach because you do not know, it is not within your experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That's why I don't preach.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right, then... (laughter) That is another thing. But as soon as you say "beyond your experience," that means you have no experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So you cannot explain. That is all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That means I have the experience...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> ...that my experience is limited...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But that's all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> ...and God is unlimited.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is all right. That I admit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Therefore, I cannot anyhow have experience of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, no. Just like you know...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> And nobody can.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...you do not know me, you have no experience about me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if I say, "I am like this," you will get experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> If I live with you for some time...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Suppose if you are thinking of me, "Swamiji might have one thousand dollars," so you can imagine, go on imagining, and that is not correct. But if I say, "No, I have got one million dollars," then you get the experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why no?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I will get the experience of you when we are living together.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means you cannot talk with God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Of course not.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if anyone can talk?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Well, if it is his own experience, I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But my experience is that you cannot...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. Therefore, our experience is we take experience from God. We don't imagine. That is our process.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, that is your faith. You must have faith for that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Just like Kṛṣṇa is speaking about Himself, so we are taking <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> as it is. So direct experience. Taking experience "I am like this." Just like Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-sa...<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>

<div class="Conversation">"I am the source of all the spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise, who know this perfectly, engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Just see. This experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but who has written the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I mean, you need to have faith for that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> You must have faith to believe that God wrote the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why faith? God is God. Why faith?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Because, you know, I have been living in...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, you have no experience you have said. You have no experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No, I have not said. You said I did.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, you said that God is beyond your experience, you said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> A real swami listen first if he wants to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First of all let us consider ourself. You said that God is beyond your experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That's right. That is <i class="calibre3">my</i> experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right, that's all right. That means I am talking with you. Therefore, you have no experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You say God is beyond your experience, you say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, and I have that experience that God is beyond experience, because I found out that all my experience does not mean God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if you say God is beyond your experience, that you have no experience of God. This is clear meaning. Why do you go round about?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No, you don't..., you see...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then it is a bit difficult.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I have always told that the duty of the swami is to listen and to understand, and you don't seem to listen and to understand. You misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, I use... First of all let us... Why misunderstand? You say that you have no experience of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No, I never said that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then tell me your experience. That I want to know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That every time I had an experience of God, and first I went through the <i class="calibre3">bhakta,</i> and I was a <i class="calibre3">bhakta</i> for a long, long time, then I found out that God was beyond my experience.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That means you have no experience. How can I talk with you?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That the image of God, whether you call it Kṛṣṇa or Rāma or Nṛsiṁha or any of the <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>... And you know, near our place in Poona in Amenagar(?), there was a swami who called himself an <i class="calibre3">avatāra,</i> and...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That anyone can say. I can say third <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>, he can say fourth <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> So if anyone can say...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is another thing. That is another thing, because everyone can say "I am <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> So how can we have faith of anyone who said he was an <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, we don't accept anyone as <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>. We have got documents who is <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, Kṛṣṇa is... Kṛṣṇa is <i class="calibre3">avatārī</i>. He is the origin. That is stated here, <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 10.8]. You know Sanskrit? What is the meaning of <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ</i>? "I am the source of all <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but who has written that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Who has written that? Śrīla Vyāsa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anywhere he has written. Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa has written. Kṛṣṇa has spoken, Vyāsadeva has written, and it is accepted.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But this is what the Christians say about the Bible, and I don't believe it (inaudible).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, you don't believe anything, that is another thing. That is another thing. Without belief, you cannot make progress.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Ah, you have to go beyond.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> As soon as you... Just like you learn who is your father. You take the version of your mother and you believe that "He is my father." Otherwise there is no other way. How can you know your father? The only means is his mother recommends, "My dear boy, he is your father." And that is perfect, that's all. Otherwise you cannot know who is your father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but you know...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you say, "Mother, I don't believe it," you don't believe it, but you cannot know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> The trouble, you know, is that so many people are coming either in India or (inaudible)...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, I mean to say...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> ...that "I am an <i class="calibre3">avatāra"</i> or "I am Guru Mahārāj-ji" or "I am," so to say, "Meher Baba or Satya Sai Baba," so many <i class="calibre3">bābās</i> exist, you know as well as I do. Now, who has to say this one is really <i class="calibre3">bābā</i>. They are all abusing us. Now, if so many people today pretends to be <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i> and they have many disciples.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But we don't believe them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No, but they have many disciples.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Many disciples, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Millions.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Millions, trillions, that is another thing. But we have to see what is the disciple. That we have to see. Simply if somebody... So many disciples by number, we have to see the quality. What is the quality, not the number, not the quantity.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> And if I had said that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is stated in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>,</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="Conversation">Kṛṣṇa does not say that "millions and millions of people know Me." No. Out of millions and millions of people, one is perfect. And out of millions of perfect person, one may know Him. That He says. So we cannot accept because one is accepted by millions, therefore he is God. We don't accept it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> That's right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We want to see the quality, not the quantity. So our process is <i class="calibre3">paramparā</i>. Just like in India-you have been in India-there are <i class="calibre3">ācāryas:</i> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Caitanya. If the <i class="calibre3">ācārya</i> accept, then we accept. This is our process. We don't go the millions; we see the quality. Rāmānujācārya, high quality devotee; Madhvācārya, high quality devotee; Caitanya, high quality devotee. If they say he is God, then we accept. This is our process. We don't see how many millions of followers. No. We want to see the quality man. He says yes. So Śaṅkarācārya says "Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead," Rāmānujācārya says "the Supreme Personality of Godhead," Madhvācārya says "Supreme," Caitanya says "Supreme," then we accept. That's all. <i class="calibre3">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 17.186]<i class="calibre3">. Tarko apratiṣṭhaḥ</i>. Simply by argument we cannot understand the truth. <i class="calibre3">Tarko apratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā</i>. And if you simply consult Vedic literature, that is also not possible. There are different statements. <i class="calibre3">Tarko apratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnā, nāsāv munir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam</i>. A <i class="calibre3">muni,</i> a saintly person, a philosopher is not a philosopher or <i class="calibre3">muni</i> if he does not agree with others. He must disagree, then he becomes. So that is also not the way. <i class="calibre3">Dharmasya tattvaṁ nihitaṁ guhāyām</i>: it is very confidential. Then how to know? <i class="calibre3">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 17.186]. Big personalities, <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>-that is the process. <i class="calibre3">Ācāryopāsanam</i>. What is that, in the Thirteenth Chapter? <i class="calibre3">Ācāryopāsanam</i>, we have to understand through the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>. That is our process. That is recommended in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</i> [Bg. 4.2]. We accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead not by our experience but by the experience of the <i class="calibre3">acaryas</i> who are recognized, and then we follow. Just like Arjuna accepts Kṛṣṇa in the Tenth Chapter. Find out, <i class="calibre3">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</i> [Bg. 10.12]. Read it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma<br class="calibre2"/>pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam<br class="calibre2"/>ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.12]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that translation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b> "Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are unborn and the all-pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Nārada, Asita, Devala, and Vyāsa proclaim this of You, and now You Yourself are declaring it to me."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So Kṛṣṇa says, and He is confirmed by Vyāsadeva, Asita, Nārada. This is the process. We do not accept everyone says "I am <i class="calibre3">avatāra</i>, I am God." We don't accept. But because it is accepted by the <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>, therefore we accept. Just like the same example I can give: I do not know who is my father, and many people will come, "I am your father." So we do not accept them. When mother says, "He is your father," then accept. That is final. I have no experience. It is beyond my experience, because father existed before my birth. So beyond my experience. So I am finding out who is my father, and so many people are coming, "I am your father." No. But as soon as the mother says, "No, no, this man is your father," then we accept. Then our business finished. Then we get experience. Father is beyond my experience, but when we receive the knowledge through the mother, then we get experience. Arjuna says that: <i class="calibre3">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</i> [Bg. 10.12], "You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Not only You are saying, but You are accepted by these authorities." That is all. I cannot get my experience of God; that is not possible. God comes, He says, and Kṛṣṇa comes and He is accepted by all the great <i class="calibre3">ācāryas</i>, then our business is perfect. So give them <i class="calibre3">prasāda</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Yes. I have <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i> in my office.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</i> [Cc. Madhya 17.186].</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Have you seen our <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He saw our all books. He is a scholar.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> This is a translation of <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata Purāṇa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> In sixty volumes we will translate this.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> We have <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Here it is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> And the <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>, all volumes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Would you like to see some of the pictures?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> These have been painted by our devotees. The meeting of Lord Caitanya and Sanātana Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The American devotees, they have painted. We have got a very big painting department. All these pictures, they are painted by our devotees.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> This is one of our other specialties.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asya upajāyate.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> This is also a translation of the Tenth Canto of <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. It's a description of the activities of Lord Kṛṣṇa. That's in two volumes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It's a tremendous work.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Our books are selling very nice. Last year we have sold four million copies throughout the whole world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> This is <i class="calibre3">Nectar of Devotion</i> by a chief disciple of Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He quotes from all different scriptures, the <i class="calibre3">Purāṇas</i>, and he supports devotional service.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> This is what you use for your devotional service?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They're a model.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> We have many copies downstairs. You can take. It was Lord Caitanya's plan that for the common men there would be much chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa and distributing of <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i>. And for those who are intellectually inclined, there is very high philosophy. So by Prabhupāda's grace, we are presenting all these things. It is not different than Lord Caitanya presented five hundred years ago. If you have opportunity later, you can hear some of our <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i> in the temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes. This is why I am coming,</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> And no one is from India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I could see, because in India you don't find that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> Mr. Chenique(?) wanted to ask you some questions. (indistinct) French and I can translate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Mr. Chenique:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He is asking what do you think about Herbert, Mr. Herbert that you met in Geneva, because he has been following his teaching in the last three days, and he would like to know what you think about what he is teaching.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Do you remember this gentleman?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> He was the one who wrote that book.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Herbert?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Yes, that's right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Mr. Herbert?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Bhagavān:</b> Yes. He's asking your opinion of him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, he is a scholar, but he is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So I met him. He is a good gentleman, scholar, but he is a Māyāvādī, he is impersonalist.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if he... He has already written one book. He has presented me, that <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa...</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> <i class="calibre3">The Yoga of Love</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> <i class="calibre3">The Yoga of Love</i>. So he has many times repeated the word "Kṛṣṇa." That will benefit him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Mr. Sheni:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He said that in the Christian philosophy that the conception of God as the person, the personal God, and God as the divine essence. So he is asking...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> God is person, then? What did he say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> Then he said that so is it not that God, the person, this divine essence, is a superperson, an evolved person, and not exactly somebody impersonal. Like he said that in Śaṅkarācārya's philosophy there is the conception of <i class="calibre3">tat</i>. So is not this <i class="calibre3">tat</i> conception, this divine essence, this superperson...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, He is divine essence. God is divine essence, just like you have volumes of milk and you churn it, then you get so much butter. So the butter is the essence of the milk. Similarly, the spirit is vast, all-pervading. The example, another example, is just like the sunshine universally spread, very big. Then you concentrate the sunshine, it is sun globe. And if you still concentrate, you will see within the sun globe there is sun-god. So he is the essence of this light, the sunshine light, the sun globe light, and the person-sun-god, Vivasvān, he is person-he is the essence among all this light. That is explained in the <i class="calibre3">Brahma-samhitā, yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bs. 5.40]. The whole creation means expansion of the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">Yasya prabhā prabhavato<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bs. 5.40]. By expansion of the bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa, this Brahman, <i class="calibre3">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam, tad brahma<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bs. 5.40]. That Brahman. Brahman is..., just like the sunshine is the expansion of the bodily rays of sun-god.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> also it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse">vadanti tat tattva-vidas<br class="calibre2"/>tattvaṁ yaj jñānam advayam<br class="calibre2"/>brahmeti paramātmeti<br class="calibre2"/>bhagavān iti śabdyate<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.11]</div>
<div class="Conversation">The Absolute Truth is one, but it is realized in different angles of vision: Brahman, Paramātmā, and Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And that is confirmed in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 10.8], "I am the origin of everything-Brahman, Paramātmā, everything, Bhagavān." <i class="calibre3">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You take that sweet preparation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Mr. Sheni:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He is asking if it is possible for young Christians... Because each time he has been coming he has been bringing with him people, you know, Christian who have been chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, with him. So he is asking if it is possible for them to chant the name God, that in fact is not really a name, by the name Kṛṣṇa, because according to what you are explaining, God is Kṛṣṇa. So can they chant the name of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Kṛṣṇa is God. Kṛṣṇa is God. God is the idea of greatness. That is Brahman. Or you can say also person, but not the particular person. God means, the Sanskrit word is <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>, the controller. So everyone is controller to some extent. In his own atmosphere he is a controller, as I am controller of my disciples. So the conception of God is there, but I am not the Supreme God. Therefore, there are two words. We use the word "Godhead," "the Supreme God." That is explained in the <i class="calibre3">Brahma-saṁhitā, īśvara</i>, God. Everyone is God; that is another thing. But <i class="calibre3">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ</i>, the Supreme God, is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Supreme. We have got experience of <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>. Just like I said, everyone is <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>, everyone is a controller. So I am personal, I am also <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i> of my body. I am controlling my body. So in that way, everyone is <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>. But these <i class="calibre3">īśvaras</i>, they are controlled by another <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>. We are <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>, but I am controlled by another <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i>. But <i class="calibre3">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1], He is <i class="calibre3">īśvara</i> but He is not controlled by anyone. That is <i class="calibre3">paramaḥ</i>, supreme. From the dictionary meaning also we can under..., being and Supreme Being. We are being, but we are controlled by another being, he is controlled by another being, he is controlled by another being. In this way, you go. If you find out some being who is not controlled by anyone, he is Supreme Being. This is the idea.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So "Nobody is superior to Me," there is nobody controller. Kṛṣṇa is not controlled by anyone. Therefore, He is <i class="calibre3">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]. That is final God. Otherwise God... You will find, you are more powerful than me, he is more powerful than you, and somebody is more powerful than him, go on, go on, seeing, seeing.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He is explaining that what he would like, that all these young Christian that he knows, it's not that he wants them to stop Christianity but to take in Kṛṣṇa consciousness what is missing in Christianity to help them in their own development.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then we should not.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Not because they do something wrong that somebody else has to do something wrong.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Thing is that just like there are scholars, the scholars also go. Just like you are doing in India. Why did you go to India? Why did you go to India and live there and (indistinct)? Anyone can come to study, to learn how to teach. That is human society. You cannot say that "You don't come here." You cannot say.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I know, but for a European to dress as an Indian...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no. Europeans go to India, and why the Indians should not come to Europe?</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I have not said that you dress like that. You like, you do it. Did I say that you do it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It's like the Indian Catholic priest dressing like a (indistinct) priest or like a European priest. I mean, they look as if they had a disguise with them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, just like when the English were ruling, English national. So the Englishmen never said that "You dress like Englishmen," but they automatically dressed. You know very well. They do like that. The Englishmen, they went there to get some money by trade, by politics. But they never went there to change their dress. But they thought that "If I dress myself like Englishman, I will be more honored." That is their point. Similarly, we never preach that "You dress like this." But the student, they like this dress. That's all right. What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> It's not wrong. It's funny.</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He translated the Tukārāma in French.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tukārāma. Tukārāma is great Vaiṣṇava devotee of Maharastra. His movement was <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> movement.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> He was the one who was initiated by Lord Caitanya?</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, another thing that's stated in the Bible, in the Christians' philosophy, they say that God created man out of His own image. It's stated in the Bible. So therefore man has a form, why not God? Because it's stated there in the Bible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. I think Bible is on the personal understanding of God. Christ says that he is son of God. Unless one is person, how he can beget a son?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They talk about the trilogy-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. It is compared like the Father...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Bhagavān, Paramātmā, and Brahman, yes. <i class="calibre3">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.2.11<span class="Italic">]</span>, it is the same idea. Brahman, Holy Ghost, is impersonal, but Son is person and God is also person. I do not know much about, but I have heard from Christians that there is assembly of God, and Lord Christ has got a seat by the side of God. Is not that explained?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> It's on His right hand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> On his right side he's supposed to be seated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. These are all personal ideas.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> And they say also, "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> "Hallowed be Thy name."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> "Hallowed be Thy name."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> "Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They're praising the name of the Lord.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. No, we have got very regard, good regard, for Christianity. We take it as Vaisnavism. It is explained according to country, time. And the commandments are very nice. The first commandment is "Thou shall not kill," but that is not stopped in the Christian world. Therefore we say that the Christians are not following. Christianity is all right. Those who are professing Christianity, they are not following.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Muhammadanism also Vaiṣṇavism, because Muhammad says, "I am servant of God, Allah." So that is our conception, <i class="calibre3">dāsya-rasa, dāsya. Śānta, dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, mādhurya</i>. So prayer, offering prayer, that is also <i class="calibre3">bhakti. Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam arcanaṁ vandanam</i>. Just like we are worshiping Deity and somebody is offering prayer-both of them are approved. Prayer, <i class="calibre3">vandanam. Dāsyam sakhyam ātma-nivedanam</i>. So we don't say that this is bad and this is good. No. Both of them are <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i>. To worship the Deity or to offer prayer, the effect is the same. Effect is not different. Either of these nine processes,</div>
<div class="Verse">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ<br class="calibre2"/>smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam<br class="calibre2"/>arcanaṁ vandanaṁ dāsyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sakhyam ātma-nivedanam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.5.23]</div>
<div class="Conversation">Either you follow all the nine principles or eight or six or seven, at least one, then you become perfect. That is our preaching. Just like Akrūra, the example is given. Akrūra got perfection simply by offering prayers. So I see when the Christian go to the church, in India I have seen, in Bombay especially, they kneel down and offer prayer. That's very good. We do not say that this is not approved. This is also approved. What is this Hare Kṛṣṇa? This is also prayer. Hare Kṛṣṇa, "O Kṛṣṇa, O the energy of Kṛṣṇa, kindly engage me in Your service." This is the meaning of Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is prayer. Repeatedly praying, "My Lord, the energy of Lord, kindly engage me in Your service." This is the meaning of Hare Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">mantra</i>. Just like you go to a mercantile firm with application, "Please give me some service. Give me some service," the same thing, appealing to God and His energy, "Please engage me in your service." So that is <i class="calibre3">vandana</i>. So <i class="calibre3">vandana</i>, and Christian also they pray, "O God, give us our daily bread." So this is also good, but it is material, asking something for material satisfaction. And here, Hare Kṛṣṇa, asking something for satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, "Engage me is Your service," little advanced because God is supplying bread to everyone, even to the cats and dogs.</div>
<div class="Conversation">So that is also good, and it is confirmed in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā, ārto arthārthī jñānī ca catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ. Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna, ārtaḥ. Ārtaḥ</i> means distress, <i class="calibre3">ārtaḥ</i>, one who is distressed. "I have no food, sir, my dear Lord. Kindly give me some food." So he is distressed, so he is praying to God because he is pious. The Communists say, "Why you are praying to God? You pray to us, the government. We shall give you enough bread." The Communist propaganda is like that. They send the people to the church, "So you pray." So they pray. "Have you got bread?" They say, "No, sir." "Now pray to us." "Give us, sir," and he gives hundreds of breads. In this way, they are making atheist. Because common man cannot argue, neither they know so much logic. But if there is some intelligent man, he will ask immediately that "Wherefrom you have got this bread? Who has given you the wheat? That you have not manufactured; that is given by God." So actually God gives, but the Communists take the credit that "I give." This is the misconception. If God does not supply you... <i class="calibre3">Eko bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān</i>, He is supplying for everyone. So if He does not supply, then what your bakery machine will do? It is useless. So people have lost the intelligence in the Communist countries. They think that these government men, they have brought the bread, not God. In this way, they are gradually becoming atheist. But the central point is God. We are preaching the central point is God. You call Him by any name, it doesn't matter, either you call Jehovah or Kṛṣṇa or something, Allah, that doesn't matter. But you accept the authority of God and try to love God. This is our mission. And we say God is person. Impersonal feature, that is a feature only. Just like sun-god is a person and the sunshine is one of the feature of the sun-god. The sunshine is not final. You have to penetrate to the sunshine and reach the sun globe and go within the globe and see that there is the sun-god. But that requires strength how to enter into the sun globe and see this. But there is the information in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā: imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam, vivasvān manave prāha</i> [Bg. 4.1], "I first of all instructed this yoga system of <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> to the sun-god." The sun-god is there in the sun planet, and if you have got strength, you can go there and see. But you cannot go, although it is material. So similarly, in the spiritual world there is the Supreme Spirit, Supreme Being, He is spiritual, concentrated, essence of light. That is <i class="calibre3">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</i> [Bg. 10.8]. He is the origin of everything.

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So at least in the human society, everyone must have understanding of God, that is expected. It is not expected in the society of cats and dogs because they are animals. The human being, <i class="calibre3">dharmasya glāniḥ</i>, there is <i class="calibre3">dharma</i>, some sort of religious system. And religious system means to understand God. That's all. Just like to become a lawyer means to understand the laws of the state. Similarly, religious system means the process by which one can understand God. And that is the summary of <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 1.2.6].

If somebody says, "Oh, it is a very great thing to understand God and to love Him," they are thinking it is not possible. No. The answer is <i class="calibre3">ahaituky apratihatā</i>. It can be learned by anyone. It is not checked by any material condition. If one wants to know what is God and to love Him, the path is open for everyone. It does not require high intelligence, high education, high culture. No. Anyone. The process is <i class="calibre3">śravaṇam</i>, the beginning. One has to hear. One may be fool number one, it doesn't matter. No education, it doesn't matter. Poor, doesn't matter. Black, doesn't matter. White, doesn't matter.

<div class="Conversation"> "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Purport.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b> "The path of spiritual realization is undoubtedly difficult. The Lord therefore advises us to approach a bona fide spiritual master in the line of disciplic succession from the Lord Himself. No one can be a bona fide spiritual master without following this principle of disciplic succession. The Lord is the original spiritual master, and a person in the disciplic succession can convey the message of the Lord as it is to his disciple. No one can be spiritually realized by manufacturing his own process, as is the fashion of the foolish pretenders. The <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam </i>says: <i class="calibre3">dharmaṁ hi sākṣād-bhagavat-praṇītam</i>-the path of religion is directly enunciated by the Lord. Therefore, mental speculation or dry arguments cannot help one progress in spiritual life. One has to approach a bona fide spiritual master to receive the knowledge. Such a spiritual master should be accepted in full surrender, and one should serve the spiritual master like a menial servant, without false prestige. Satisfaction of the self-realized spiritual master is the secret of advancement in spiritual life. Inquiries and submission constitute the proper combination for spiritual understanding. Unless there is submission and service, inquiries from the learned spiritual master will not be effective. One must be able to pass the test of the spiritual master, and when he sees the genuine desire of the disciple, he automatically blesses the disciple with genuine spiritual understanding. In this verse, both blind following and absurd inquiries are condemned. One should not only hear submissively from the spiritual master, but one must also get a clear understanding from him, in submission and service and inquiries. A bona fide spiritual master is by nature very kind toward the disciple. Therefore when the student is submissive and is always ready to render service, the reciprocation of knowledge and inquiries becomes perfect."</div>

<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. We are recommending "Chant the holy name of God." So if you have got the holy name of God, you can chant that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Man:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> He said that in Christianity God has no name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> God has no name in Christianity, but the son of God has a name. And before they use for a long time, and everywhere they were saying the name of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But they say that in Christianity there is a name of God. They say. No?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But you said that His name be glorified.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> They say "Hallowed be Thy name."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> But the name is not said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Never said.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Jesus said that "All I have taught you is not the total sum of the knowledge of God," he says, "but there is more to be told."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right. So if you have no name, then why don't you take this name, "Kṛṣṇa"?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is the objection?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Man:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says... Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <i class="calibre3">nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis.</i></div>
<div class="Verse">nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis<br class="calibre2"/>tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavan mamāpi<br class="calibre2"/>durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ</div>
<div class="Conversation"><i class="calibre3">Bahudhā:</i> God has many names. If you are missing, so you can take one of the name. Kṛṣṇa is one of the names, so what is the objection? And Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, "In this name, all the potencies of God is there." <i class="calibre3">Nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śakti tatrārpitā. </i>That name is as powerful as God Himself. There is no difference between the name and God, because He is absolute. Here in the material world there is the difference between name and the person or the thing. If I am thirsty, if I simply chant "water, water, water," that will not appease my thirstiness. But the spiritual world, absolute, the name and the person is the same. <i class="calibre3">Abhinnatvān nāma-nāminoḥ</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya </i>17.133]. Under the circumstances, if you are missing some name, so take this name. Why it should not be taken?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Jyotirmayī:</b> (French)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but you can take "Rāma," you can take "Paraśurāma," you can take (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, yes, any name, any name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Kṛṣṇa has no special...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. Special there is. In this way, it is recommended in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra,</i> recommended in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>: <i class="calibre3">harer nāma. Harer</i> means of God. <i class="calibre3">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<i class="calibre3">.</i> So this is the... We have to chant the name of God. This is the prescription. This is Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Does it matter...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Now, there are thousands and thousands of names, that we also admitted. At least we have got <i class="calibre3">sahasra-nāma, viṣṇu sahasra</i>. But in another place it is said, other <i class="calibre3">Upaniṣad,</i> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma... This name is recommended. Just like <i class="calibre3">Agni Purāṇa</i> and <i class="calibre3">Kalisantaraṇa Upaniṣad</i>, in this Vedic literature, this...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but each <i class="calibre3">Upaniṣad</i> will recommend its own specific Deity, you know. Rāma, as you say, Hare Rāma. Or Śiva.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, Rāma is all right. Rāma we chant. Hare Rāma we chant. Hare Kṛṣṇa and Hare Rāma. Rāma also we chant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Or Śiva. I mean, you see, in the <i class="calibre3">Śvetāśvatara Upaniṣad.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> I mean, what devotees? You have got <i class="calibre3">bhakti </i>also in the Śaivite , all the others.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> The argument, if you say that it is not special, then you will say that you can chant any name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b> We say that God's name is special, whatever name it is. Not that we eliminate God, saying He's not special. He is special. Whether you call Him by this authorized name or that authorized name, His name is special because it's nondifferent from Him. So not that we should just overlook the name of God because we're overlooking God. We do that, so we have to...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b><i class="calibre3"> Harer nāma</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<i class="calibre3">. Harer nāma </i>means God's name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> You see, for instance, in Christianity for a long time there was a <i class="calibre3">bhakti,</i> and this <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> was devoted to the name of Jesus. So for a very long time you had that Jesus <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i>. And in your country, in America today, like you have got the Hare Kṛṣṇa, you have got also the Jesus devotees. Now, this is also present in many places. And the name does not matter. There is no name who has got the... Because then you find again what...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No. If Jesus is the name of God, then you can chant. If Jesus is the name of God. But Jesus, Lord Jesus Christ, says that he is son of God. Of course, there is no difference between son and the father. That is another thing. But still, if I want the father, how by calling the name of son I can get the father? That is also another thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but I mean, this is another point.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But if you have got the father's name, why should you call Him by the son's name?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but this is another discussion (indistinct). What we mean by father and son, you know, we don't mean it...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That everyone's father and son is the same. If father says something and the son says... Just like in a big family, if the son orders something, it is as good as the father's order. That is our experience. But still, if you want to call the father, you will not get the father's response by calling the name of the son.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Jesus told us, "If you see me, you see the Father, because the Father cannot be seen." It was a common name. Yoshua was a common Jewish name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Now, one thing is that if we are interested in chanting the name of God, if it is available, then why should I chant the name of the son?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> No, it is not that question. The question is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> Excuse me for interrupting, but one thing was that you suggested that the name of Kṛṣṇa is a very common name...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> ...in the sense that many people may be called Kṛṣṇa. But the Supreme God is also called Kṛṣṇa. So if you chant His name, you derive the benefit even if you're not thinking of Him as the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah, but for the Christian the same. Jesus is a very common name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> That's all right. We're saying chant. Our spiritual master is teaching "You chant the name of God." That's the important thing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you think that Jesus Christ's name is also, you can chant, we have no objection. We say that you chant the holy name of God, whatever you have got. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> And for a Muslim you mean to chant Allah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Name Kṛṣṇa, Allah, Jesus, (indistinct), what is the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Allah is not name. That is... It is not the name. It is just like the idea of God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Allah means God, <i class="calibre3">īśvara.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Allah means also (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But that is not the name. That is... Just like the President and Mr. Nixon. The President may be another person. Not only Nixon, but another person also may be. So President is the general understanding of the post. But still, one who occupies the post, he has got a name.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Do you know the Sufi?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Do you know the Sufis are Muslims (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> They are the great mystics of Islam, and they always address God as Allah. As we say...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Allah means God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Yes. It is the name of God for them. "Allah the all-knowing is great." Anybody who knows Islam knows that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway, if one chants Allah or Jesus Christ, we have no objection. We don't say that you stop it. We say that you chant the holy name of God. If that name is of God, you chant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> Yesterday, Srila Prabhupāda, you gave the story, I think you said it was from the <i class="calibre3">Padma Purāṇa</i>, about a Muslim who was attacked by a wild boar.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Yogeśvara:</b> He was attacked by a wild boar, and the boars for the Muslims are untouchable. So he was saying <i class="calibre3">haram, haram,</i> which means untouchable. And he was killed by that boar, but it was taken by higher authority that he was chanting "<i class="calibre3">ha rāma</i>," which means "where is Lord Rāma," so he derived liberation. Even unconsciously he was chanting and derived liberation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Although he did not mean Rāma, he condemned the boar as <i class="calibre3">haram,</i> condemned. But the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Same story is said in the <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> tradition of Maharastra of the hunter.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, may be the same story.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Priest:</b> Untouchable hunter who was chased by a boar and went to a tree, and then... It is a common story.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anyway, we are recommending "Chant the holy name of God." (end)</div>
