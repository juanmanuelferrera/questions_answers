<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> I think there's one, so that means I'll have to get an adaptor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This cord is not reaching well. You think perhaps it would be nice to keep it on the floor? (tapping sound) Not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh, there is no bulb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> No bulb. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, yes, you can set it here. I wanted that box covered, then I would have kept here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> All right, I'll (indistinct) cover. Light bulb (indistinct). (devotee enters)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Pratyatoṣa. Do you know what is the <i class="calibre3">pratyatoṣa</i>? <i class="calibre3">Prati</i>, <i class="calibre3">pratyatoṣa.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> What is the translation, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> He can satisfy everyone.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. Only Kṛṣṇa consciousness person satisfies everyone, can claim this (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> I'd like to give you this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (aside:) Get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> This here. It's my savings account, and there's a deposit slip in there, eleven hundred and thirty-three dollars and thirty-four cents, and I would like to present it as a gift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Śyāmasundara: </b>Ātreya Ṛṣi can take care of all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's a withdrawal slip. That's just... That's Ātreya Ṛṣi..., and Ātreya Ṛṣi can take care of the details of getting the money out of the account to do whatever you want with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct) the amount, you can charge my account (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Originally we were planning on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all, it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This is a presentation from Mahāpuruṣa. It's a dollar and <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa's</i> thread. It's a humble presentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> You're not going to be working this immediately? I want to get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, if you want to join, join it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> I want to do it nicely, so it's not in your way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> No, just later on I can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why later on? Now. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I just wanted to ask you about, I'd like to get you a tape recorder. I wanted to get a real, real nice one. And I was thinking of getting one that has four channels. You could record four channels simultaneously or you could record if you want to one channel at a time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Stanberg? Stanberg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, no, it's a Sony, it's a Sony Professional.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Eight track. It has eight track.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It'll work anywhere in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Because the speed is electronically controlled, so you don't have to worry about the current, how many cycles per second. It'll work at different voltages, so it'll work anywhere in the world. And you could record your voice on one channel and <i class="calibre3">karatālas</i> on the other channel and <i class="calibre3">mṛdaṅga</i> on another channel, and you can mix them together at the end.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is very big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, I think this one probably might be kind of big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Can you carry it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Oh, sure. Sonys are actually pretty compact. You can tell by the size of the reels. But, see, there's four meters, so you could record four tracks, four channels simultaneously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And it's stereo?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Stereo and quadraphonic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> That means eight..., just like yours, four-track, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This is eight track.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> No, this isn't eight track.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> This is eight channel. You can only record in one direction when you use four channels. But you can also use it as a standard stereo and record in both directions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> First of all this way, then this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, you can do that, or else you could use all four tracks at the same time and just record in one direction if you want all four channels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There are four microphones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, you can have four microphones at the same time. To make good stereo recordings of music, it's nice to have four channels, because then you can mix them together afterwards and you can make it perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is Sony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> See, these are really Kṛṣṇa's mercy. They have microphones, these are microphones. They're made in Sweden. They're really about the best line you can get, and they're very inexpensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Why the sound is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's on very low now. This is very low.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, it comes one, two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's on zero.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is zero. Then one it comes. (Sound of Prabhupāda's voice on tape recorder is heard.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It goes up to ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> So this is what I planned on doing with the money, but then Bhavānanda and the GBC wondered about whether maybe the Book Fund or the around-the-world trip would have higher priority. So that's why I just wanted to donate the money, so maybe after I'm <i class="calibre3">gṛhastha</i> I could get this for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> This money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yeah, he wanted to donate this money for a tape recorder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> The GBC suggested that he give it just to your Book Fund or else to pay for the around-the-world tour, to help pay for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> They thought that might have higher priority than... It's a project, I wanted to set up a library of all of your tapes and make them available to everybody and preserve them, and have them all indexed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I wanted a tape recorder.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Do you think this would fit your needs, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes, I wanted. I wanted to purchase one Stanberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Tanberg?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, we have a Tanberg here that you can use. I had it in Detroit, remember? It's a very, very good machine, and I'm going to leave it here in New York because I have to go to Minneapolis for some training because of my job. I have a job as a computer programmer, so I have to go there for a while, but I'll be back in New York. But I'm going to show Gadādhara and Candanācārya how to use it so they can use it, and then you can use it during the daytime. It's a really good machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So where is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> That's a Tanberg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Now it's in the temple. I use it when Your Divine Grace is speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So where is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's in the temple room right now. It's connected to the P.A. system and a microphone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So you bring it and we will see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Okay. I have to leave tonight, but I'll instruct Gadādhara and Candanācārya how to use it while I'm gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Tanberg machine is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, it's a good machine. It's made in Norway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And that is not very costly also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> No, I ordered it directly from Norway, saved quite a bit on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What did you pay for it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Two hundred and twenty-five, and the list price at the time was five hundred and fifty. I got this before I came into the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So it is five hundred and fifty the same machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, that's what they charged in the United States, five hundred fifty, and I ordered it for two hundred and twenty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> In Norway I got it, and then there's duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The same machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yes, exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then bring it, it is working. Then we can utilize this one for other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> OK, fine. But maybe someday then I can get this, do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Do you think someday we could use that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I do not know, but I have got experience Tanberg is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, they're very reliable. They're reliable machines. And also, my job is computer programming, and I think that computers could be used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Computer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, they could be used in many, many ways in the Society. Like one... I think the most important use it could be put to is for helping in transcribing and editing and composing. A computer can do composing automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Automatically?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Sure. It's all automatic, because it's actually just a mechanical process, just getting the lines to come out even at the end and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You can learn that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I already know computer programming, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I learned it in high school, and I was working as a programmer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Then why not take a computer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Sure. And we can get a terminal. You can buy a computer terminal for about $600.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Oh, really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> And for $185 a month, we could have forty hours a week of computer time, eight hours a day. And they have courses, this company gives computerized courses that'll teach children how to read and how to do arithmetic through the terminal. And also, it has a fantastic editor. If you type in the text, and any mistakes you make, you can just type in a few instructions with a computer and it'll change them. Then after you get all the text the way you want it, it's stored on a magnetic disk at the computer. And then when you get it perfect-you can change it a hundred times if you want-but when you get it perfect, then you just have the computer automatically type out the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You know how to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yes, Prabhupāda, I got A's in that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa: </b>These terminals have paper tape punches. You can the punch paper tape and then feed the paper tape into a machine called a photon machine, and you get out a perfectly composed page with... You can have any type size you want, you can have any type of, what do you call it, the face, the typeface, and it'll be perfect for publishing. It'll come right out of that. The whole process is automatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Those tapes can be kept, stored, all the tapes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Sure, they can be kept stored. And then... Oh, also, you get free storage with this for 300,000 characters, that's about 100 pages at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> This is a wonderful idea, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I don't know why no one thought of this before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> I'll leave this here, OK? I'll leave this here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> All right, you read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> And this tells... This is the basis of the whole language. They have Fortran...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Honeywell machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's Honeywell, yeah. And see, this is educational.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> What language...? Could we use Fortran to program this language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, there's four languages, there's the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> But what is best for programming Śrīla Prabhupāda's books? Fortran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> No, there's an editor, it's called Edit, you see, and it's designed for editing text.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Similar to Fortran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, no, it's just a special language by itself, but it's real easy to learn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Easy language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> It's very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> See, I was mostly doing Fortran. I'm a little out of practice now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> You could learn this like nothing. This is Edit. But you only have to type in the text once, just a rough, and that's it. No retyping is necessary from start to finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is wonderful. Get the books composed in no time, so fast, and paste it up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Sure. And the composers are available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, not only that, but no paste-up is required, because the pages will come out perfect, and it can just be photographed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, right, the layout is almost eliminated. Composing is completely eliminated, and the editing is so easy and so fast that it'll be... The thing is, you'll be able to get a final copy that's really perfect, because it doesn't matter how many changes you make, it's so easy. Even if there's... You have one word you want to change, and it's just a minor change. Normally you might not want to do it because that means retyping the whole thing. But with this, it's no trouble, because the computer just types it out in no time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I used to think, Śrīla Prabhupāda, "I wonder when the day is going to come when we're going to be able to use computers in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" and now maybe it's come. Composing can be eliminated, done automatically, and the layout can be done automatically because the pages will come out perfect. When they're typed out, they will come out perfect. Therefore, there is no need of layout. You simply photograph those pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> With a photon machine, you can do a whole book. You could have a thousand-page book done in one night. It would type the whole thing in one night. That's all you'd need is a (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Those machines are fantastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> They're so fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> They are fantastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> They turn out a page in a couple of seconds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Electric brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Big electric.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> And they're always perfect. There's no variation in the characters or anything like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But as soon as an electronic is a little sick, the whole thing stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> No, they're reliable machines. These are just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Yeah, that possibility is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> The brain goes bad, then it is very difficult to bring it into...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, they have maintenance men on the spot all the time. It's very reliable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> But I moving from one place to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, they have... This Honeywell system is being combined into a nationwide network so that these computers are available in every major city in the United States right now, and they're going to be eventually all tied together. We can actually communicate with other temples through the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Why is Honeywell better than IBM for this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, because they just concentrated on this more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> On this editing program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Oh, yeah, for the editing..., for our purposes, this is the best time-sharing system. I've used almost every one. It's unbelievable. It's so fast, it's so reliable. I used that for months and months and it never... It wasn't..., maybe... I can't even remember a time when the thing wasn't working. It was always working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> So reliable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They charge $180 per month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> $185 per month for 40 hours a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> That means eight hours a day, five hours...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, that's just a little over a dollar an hour for the computer time, and it's a really... Normally it would be about twelve hundred or thirteen hundred dollars a month, but because... See, there's another thing, you've got to... The time is only between 6:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m., that's why it's less expensive. But that's a better time actually, because it's after hours and you get a faster response on the computer because there's hardly anybody on it. It's really good. And normally it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is the whole price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, the terminal would cost $700 for one that handled upper and lower case. You can get 132 characters across.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> $700 altogether?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, $700...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Is that a rental?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> No, that's the purchase price. Rental would be about $85 a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> In addition to the $185?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> In addition to the $185, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Or else to purchase the machine for $700.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> But then if you purchase it, you either have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If somebody pays $700 at a time, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Well, that's for purchasing it. Then you have to maintain it yourself or else you have to hire somebody else to maintain it for you. But you could just lease it for about $85 a month, and the maintenance and paper and paper tape and supplies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have to purchase for $700, then you have to pay maintenance service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, unless you can maintain yourself. I don't think they're too difficult to maintain. Teletype terminals are very reliable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no, that's all right. Maintenance is different. Either you maintain yourself or pay that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> The machine is like a typewriter. It's hooked up with a computer... By telephone cables?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Oh, yeah. You just dial over an ordinary telephone. You can use more than one time-sharing service on the same terminal just by dialing different numbers. In Washington, D.C., I was using four different computers through the same terminal, just by dialing different numbers. And they can be thousands of miles away, it doesn't matter. In Minneapolis, I'm using a computer that's located in..., near Baltimore, near Washington, D.C. And it's just like... It doesn't matter how far away it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You receive the phone call?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, just by a phone call. Just by calling a local number, too, because they have lines already set up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Like you were talking with that big (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> I was communicating with a <i class="calibre3">karmī</i> friend of mine in Baltimore through the computer system. He was using the same computer. So that's another thing we could do, communications. And we could do a (indistinct)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We haven't got much communication with outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> We could communicate with all the temples through the... If another temple had a terminal on the same computer system, they could communicate, they could share common...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is the difference between this machine and that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> This one... This is only two channels, and this one's four channels. This one, the one that's shown, can take the large size professional reels, ten-and-a-half inch. You can also get one of these with the ten-and-a-half inch, which is really an advantage to be able to use that, that size. Because you can purchase those in cases, professional lots, and then you can put them on smaller reels if you wanted to, just cut the tape for however size the recording is and put it on a smaller reel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So first of all you bring this Tanberg, then I shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> I'll just leave all this here. (aside:) Take this, this is with the microphone. These are Kona(?) microphones. They're unbelievable, they're so good. You want to keep that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> I just want to see... I want to see the computer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Śrīla Prabhupāda, actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What is the price of this machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> I'm not too sure, but it'd probably be about two hundred and fifty, something like that. The numbers usually sort of correspond to the price more or less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I found Tanberg better than Sony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> The very expensive Sonys are good. The less expensive Sonys aren't very good because the motors aren't powerful enough. But like that real expensive Sony has three motors, and it's got..., it's all electronically controlled with solenoids, so that there's very few moving parts, and I think it would be a really good machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> That's different from this. That's if you aren't getting this educational package, then you've got to pay all these rates. Some of these rates apply anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> All this rate business, you know about it. I just want to look at the program. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> That's a Dolby system for recording with less noise. That's for tape recorders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Why don't you check that? I'll just keep this (indistinct). What's this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> That's for the computer system. That's courses that are available over the computer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Over the computer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> Yeah, the computer teaches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> Oh, yeah. Just like these computers, you can learn the language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> This is like a mechanical tutor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (4):</b> But you can even learn this Edit language over the machine, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Machine teach language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pratyatoṣa:</b> There's a language called Teach, so we can write our own programs for teaching. We could write programs to teach <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā.</i> We could have all the scriptures on computer programs. (end)</div>
