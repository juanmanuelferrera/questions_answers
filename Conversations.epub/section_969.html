<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And I've been told that all the TV stations showed our Ratha-yātrā. That means millions of people saw the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> cart. And everyone has seen it in the newspapers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That <span class="Italic">Newsday</span> also had coverage. We didn't get that paper for Prabhupāda, but they also... This is even before their interview.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. What about <span class="Italic">Newsweek</span> and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> When those interviews that those reporters took are published, we'll send them to you immediately. (aside) <span class="Italic">Newsday,</span> Associated Press and <span class="Italic">Newsweek.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...higher(?) to temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not exactly. We go, probably, over the Fifty-ninth Street bridge, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> I think it would be better now to go through the tunnel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're going over the tunnel, into the tunnel. What street is that? Fifty...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> About Thirtieth Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You think that's faster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Yes, it goes right under... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...people of New York are appreciating, Prabhupāda, how you came here alone and now you have a big building with many followers. Actually the people are aware, very much aware of how you started this movement in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And were struggling personally. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...life there is struggle. Without struggling there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should not be, try to avoid struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Because we have got preaching point of view. Preaching means struggling. If it was simply <span class="Italic">bhajana,</span> you can sit down and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa like Haridāsa Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] "There's one credit that I have. I was never a lazy fellow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, throughout my life. (end)</div>
