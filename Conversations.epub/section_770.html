<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he does not read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> then he remains a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Anything apart from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is not really knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. May be some fragmental knowledge, but if one wants full knowledge in life, then he must read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary ABCD, and then let him read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> They have been taught like that. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhaiḥ.</span> They are passing as great leader for giving men wrong direction and spoil the life. He cannot save himself and he can spoil himself very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> People's minds are so flickering. There's so much disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The mind is the first creation for material enjoyment. From the mind, senses are created, five senses for knowledge-gathering and five senses for working, and five airs within the body. In this way the mind and fifteen. This is called <span class="Italic">ṣoḍāśa upacāra,</span> sixteen. And then the ingredients, <span class="Italic">pañca-mahā-bhūta.</span> Then intelligence, <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> false ego. These twenty-four, combination. And <span class="Italic">ātmā, jīva,</span> and then Kṛṣṇa-twenty-six. The twenty-six combination is this body, mind, self, soul, Supersoul, everything. So I am ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> I think it's just a little early yet, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Just a little early. It's still dark. I think ten minutes should be all right. Has this been used?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...is in ignorance. Combination of matter and soul, moving animals. Some of them are standing as trees and plant, and some of them are moving. Where is the science to study? What is your value of knowledge? Hm? If they do not know the fundamental things, then what is the value of their knowledge? Simply observation, superficial, externally. There is good scope. They are receiving these books. We should take chance of preaching this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> and the classes should be held especially.... No, the religious classes are already there. Let them study <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā.</span> And they will accept it. They are not fools. Simply we have to introduce it. The Western people, they are not fools, but misguided. So you take the charge of guiding them; then Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will be successful. They will appreciate, they will take it up and reform, and their life will be successful. And if they utilize their intelligence how to reduce population and kill child within the womb and "There is no soul in the womb. When they come out then the soul becomes"-what is this nonsense? Unless there is soul, how it becomes manifest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> It's obvious. If the body is growing within the womb, there must be life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same process is going on from the very beginning. A body is formed and it develops. The child is born.... The same process is going on. How do you say there is no soul? If there is no soul, how it has developed within the womb? Such rascals, they are passing on as big scientists. What is the reason they don't believe that there is no soul?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They have really no argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. All dogmatic. All dogmatic foolishness they are propagating, and it is going on in the name of <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> If they admitted the existence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vijñāna</span> should be enunciated, <span class="Italic">vigata-jñāna. Vigata,</span> you understand <span class="Italic">vigata</span>? <span class="Italic">Vigata</span> means lost. So <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> you can make two meanings. <span class="Italic">Viśiṣṭa-jñāna. Viśiṣṭa, vi</span> means.... <span class="Italic">Viśiṣṭa</span> means a full explained knowledge. You can make this meaning. And another meaning you can do. <span class="Italic">Vi</span> means <span class="Italic">vigata,</span> lost. So <span class="Italic">vigata-jñāna.</span> Their <span class="Italic">vijñāna</span> means <span class="Italic">vigata-jñāna,</span> lost of all knowledge. That is the word given in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, māyayāprahṛta-jñānaḥ.</span> This is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> You can explain in this way also. <span class="Italic">māyayāpa.... māyā</span> has taken away their knowledge, and that is going on as <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> science. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has made them rascal, and they are presenting themselves as the man of advanced knowledge. A rascal is representing himself as advanced in knowledge. That is the defect of Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Advanced demoniac knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Advanced demon. Actually they are advanced demons, <span class="Italic">asura, asurī-bhāvam āśritaḥ,</span> being infected with the contamination of atheism, godlessness. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.... (chants <span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> They're actually very expert at avoiding the real issues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is.... A child can also do that. That is not expert. A child can advance in foolishness without any guidance. If the child touches fire and if somebody says, "This is advancement of knowledge," then imagine what is the position. Similarly, all these rascals, they are endeavoring. Just like Hiranyakasipu. He endeavored all through how to become immortal, which is impossible. But he advanced in that foolishness. Hiranyakasipu was such a big demon, his only idea was that "The <span class="Italic">devatās,</span> they attack us sometimes. But now I shall attack them and plunder them. But because I am now practically immortal, what they will do? They cannot kill me. So I will go on with my demonic activities, and then they cannot do anything." This is his foolishness. He did not know that he's the greatest foolishness that he was trying to become immortal. When it was said by Brahmā that "No, no, it is not possible," still, he expected that "I shall become immortal." Brahmā flatly said, "No, no, this is not possible. I am not immortal. How can I give you immortality?" But he would not hear even Brahmā. He thought that, "In an indirect way I shall befool this man, Brahmā." "All right, sir, then give me this benediction." "What is that?" "I'll not die in the land." "All right." "Not in the water." "Yes." "Not in the air." "No, yes." So he thought that "The three things finished. Then where shall I die? There are three things only, land, water, sky. So he has given me benediction I shall not die anywhere of these three. So I have cheated now." And then "I shall not die in daytime." "Yes." "I shall not die in nighttime." But <span class="Italic">māyā</span> dictated that there is another space or another place between day and night. (laughs) That he forgot. That is called <span class="Italic">sandhyā.</span> That is accepted. But he forgot that. And Kṛṣṇa is more intelligent. He.... Hiraṇyakaśipu was not killed in daytime or nighttime. He was killed in the <span class="Italic">sandhyā.</span> And so far land, sky, and water is concerned, that also was played with tricks, that He killed him on the lap. You cannot say it is land; you cannot say it is sky, you cannot say it is water. So Kṛṣṇa is so kind that His devotee, Brahma, has given him this benediction.... Without touching all those points. Hiranyakasipu could not accuse Brahma that "Sir, you have cheated me." "No. Whatever you wanted, I have given you. You have cheated yourself. You do not know that your knowledge is imperfect. You cannot make it perfect. So that is your folly. But so far I am concerned, whatever you wanted, I said, 'Yes. Yes. Yes.' But I said also that 'In spite of all this, you'll never live.' That is not possible. But, you fool, you did not take care of it. So in spite of cunningness, you remained a fool. You thought that you are very intelligent, cunning. 'I am now fully equipped; nobody can kill me.' But I said that it is not possible. I never cheated you. You cannot say that I have cheated you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> It's just like in the law. They try to make the law so perfect that no one can get around it. But always there is some very smart lawyer who finds a loophole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Big lawyer means to find out fault with the present law. That is big lawyer. [break] ...to be more intelligent than Kṛṣṇa. That is.... (laughs) But these rascals are trying to be more intelligent. Therefore they are called rascals, fools, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Moghāśā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Moghāśā mogha-karmaṇo mogha-jñāna-vicetasaḥ [Bg. </span>9.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] .... Kṛṣṇa says simple thing, "You surrender unto Me. You'll get all protection." "No, no. That is not possible. I must do according to my own whims. Why shall I surrender?" "All right, go on. I'll give you facility for executing your whims. You'll get it. You do. Try your..." This is going on. Kṛṣṇa is giving good advice. He'll not accept it. So Kṛṣṇa is so kind, "All right, you do in your own way. I shall give you all facility." This is going.... That facility is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> his mind and <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He is desiring. That mind is also given by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> so that he can punish him very severely. So <span class="Italic">māyā</span> has given us mind: "Now you go on desiring. After desiring, desiring, I will give you facility."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Mind is an agent of punishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this material mind. You see a madman. He is also acting in his mind. The mind is polluted; he is acting differently. Mind is there, but it is covered by some infection. Therefore a madman is thinking this way, that way, this way, that way. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Constant anxiety.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. Killing himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Sometimes a person who goes mad, they have to put them in a padded cell so that they don't harm themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise he will create disadvantage to others. This is the cell-whole material world. You keep yourself within this cell and go on with your madness of mind. Still, Vedic instruction is there that if you do this way, then you go to that planet. If you do this way, then you go to here. Still, there is good. But within that, Kṛṣṇa is saying, <span class="Italic">mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām [Bg. 9.25],</span> "But you can come to Me also." But he will not take that instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Coming to Kṛṣṇa means they have to give up all their own personal desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything is there; simply we have to accept it. If we don't accept it, we suffer. What can be done? If you accept the path of going to hell in spite of higher authorities' instruction, then who can save me? That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is thinking he has become very intelligent that he can deceive God, deceive spiritual master and be happy. He does not know that he can neither deceive God or His representative, guru. That is not possible. But he is thinking like that. And he is being put into suffering condition. Just like ordinary thieves and rogues. They think, "I am deceiving government." But government has got so many agents that he will be arrested. But this sinful government may not be so expert, but how he can deceive the government of Kṛṣṇa? That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's undercover agents in everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere, every direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> The land, the sky, the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Sun, moon, everything is witness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are bearing the witness. And especially He is sitting within the heart of everyone, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva...</span> How can you deceive Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Kṛṣṇa knows more about what's going on than we do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anumantā upadṛṣṭā. Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 13.3]<span class="Italic">.</span> How these rascals think that "I can deceive God"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyayāpahṛta-jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">mayācyuta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Vigata. Vigata-jñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vigata-jñāna,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Vijñāna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Like children playing, they think that they've become a king or this or that, and they're completely absorbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why children? The children, the father also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think they're all ready. (end)</div>
