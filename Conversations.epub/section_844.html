<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...therefore he very intelligently appointed Kṛṣṇa as his spiritual master. Because everyone is in perplexity about the problem of life. So this very thing happened to Arjuna, and he wanted to go to spiritual master for solution. And the supreme spiritual master was present before him; therefore he submitted: <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ tvāṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">. Kārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Pṛcchāmi tvāṁ dharma-saṁmūḍha-cetāḥ, yac chreyaḥ syān niścitaṁ brūhi tan me.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yac chreyaḥ syāt, yac chreyaḥ syāt tat brūhi me niścitam.</span> So the spiritual master's duty is how to benefit the disciple, <span class="Italic">śreyaḥ.</span> What is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So because he accepted discipleship, so He immediately chastised him that "You rascal, you are talking like a very learned man, but you are on the platform of bodily conception of life, the platform of the animals." <span class="Italic">Yasyātma-buddhiḥ kuṇape tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who accepts this body as self, he's animal. He's not even a human being. So the whole world is on this bodily concept of life. That is going on. "American," "European," "Hindu," "Muslim," "black," "white," this, that. They do not know what is education. That is the first education, that "You rascal, you are not this body. You are within the body." So who understands this? And they're declaring that "We are student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We have studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>." Hmm? Even Gandhi, he takes photograph with <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but his fighting is for nationalism. The others are doing that. So what is the use of taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? The Pakistanis are also doing that. But you have taken <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you are doing the same work. So what is your credit? This is going on. So nobody is learning <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is first time that we are teaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Otherwise, everyone is misled. The subject matter is that the soul is different from this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> will argue that "I am not ready to hear this yet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> will argue, "I am not ready to hear this yet." Many people, they come and they hear this philosophy, they say, "Very nice. But I am not ready for it yet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why you have come here, to hear <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Why you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Generally, they come to take nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, that is also <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam. Prasādam</span> means we offer the foodstuff to Kṛṣṇa; then it is <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> So you have not come, but you have to come to take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> This, it has got connection with Kṛṣṇa. So therefore we welcome you that at least for eating, you are coming to Kṛṣṇa. Gradually, you'll understand Kṛṣṇa, by eating only. Kṛṣṇa is not so easy to be understood, but we are giving you facility to eat <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam</span> so that one day you can understand this movement. This is the policy. Actually, that is the policy. We are not poor-feeding. That is not our philosophy. Like Vivekananda. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> No, we are not after that. We are giving you <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And that is fact, that by eating, eating, eating, eating, you one day will become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Simply by eating. Because you are so dull, you cannot understand the philosophy. You know the belly like the animals. So therefore we are giving facility, "All right, fill up your belly, fill up your belly. And you'll be infected." As you take foodstuff from a infected area, you become infected with some disease, so this is Kṛṣṇa infected, <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> You take it, and one day you'll be diseased with Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And that is a fact. Some way or other, let him come in contact with Kṛṣṇa. He'll be benefited. Some way or other, let him come to the light. May be dim light or very big light. Light is light. So if anyone understands that there is a soul which is conducting the business of this body, then he can very easily understand that there is a Supersoul who is conducting the business of the whole material manifested world. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> If you convince that the body is useless, a lump of matter only, but the soul is the prime factor, similarly, he'll very easily understand that there is huge, gigantic material body of earth, water, air, fire, sky; they are working so wonderfully on account of the Supersoul. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: athavā bahunaitena kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Chapter 10, verse 42. No? (devotee takes a long time to find verse)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One should practice to open this very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">athavā bahunaitena<br class="calibre2"/>kiṁ jñātena tavārjuna<br class="calibre2"/>viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam<br class="calibre2"/>ekāṁśena sthito jagat<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 10.42]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"But what need is there, Arjuna, for all this detailed knowledge? With a single fragment of Myself I pervade and support this entire universe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it carefully. As the small soul has entered.... <span class="Italic">Dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> This is also a small universe. The same elements are working, but the soul is the prime factor. Similarly, this gigantic body. <span class="Italic">Athavā bahunaitena kiṁ jñātena.... Viṣṭabhya aham idaṁ kṛtsnam.</span> "The <span class="Italic">kṛtsnam,</span> the total material energy, millions of universes like that, that is being maintained by Me because I have entered in it in My fragmental portion." Same principle. As I, the individual soul, I am.... because I have entered this body, the body is working so nicely. It looks beautiful; it looks fresh. It is machine. The machine is working very nicely so long the pilot or the driver is there. Similarly, where is the difficulty to understand this universal affair? If we accept the same principle, that "I am a small fragmental portion of Kṛṣṇa. I have entered this body. This body is working so nicely.... Similarly, because Kṛṣṇa has entered as Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, therefore it is working."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Kṛṣṇa also says, <span class="Italic">gām āviśya ca bhūtāni [Bg. 15.13].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are so many verses. Another verse is <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ [Bg. 9.10].</span> "The <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is not important. Material energy is not important. My supervision is important." <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakraḥ.</span> The sun is rising and setting by whose order? <span class="Italic">Govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam aham...</span> This is to be understood. And if one understands that because the soul is there within the body, therefore the body is working so wonderfully, then he can very easily understand there must be a soul of this universe. How he can deny it? How he can say that it is working automatically? There is no such experience, working automatically. I have given several times the example: the 747, wonderful aeroplane machine, but that is not important. The important is the pilot who is pushing the button and it is, in such big sky, it will stay balanced; in balance it is flying in six hundred miles speed, <span class="Italic">onh-onh-onh-onhh.</span> (imitates sound of plane flying). And as soon a little.... Finished. So it is a fact. Why the security checking? Because sometimes these, what is that, hi.... hi...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Highjackers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Highjacks, they attack the pilot. They're not attacking the passengers. (end)</div>
