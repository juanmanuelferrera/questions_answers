<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (1):</span> ...were minstrels who wander who wander our city streets, mumbling about Hare Kṛṣṇa, then the man to answer your questions is the man who started the Kṛṣṇa movement, His Divine Grace Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda. And if you have trouble following that, the best is yet to come. His message might seem complicated to the unconverted, but when it's all boiled down, it's quite simple. All you have to do is concentrate, like Carol Jarvis did during this in-depth interview. (sound of <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Your Divine Grace, what prompted you to start the Kṛṣṇa movement? (From here on follow excerpts of Interview, Melbourne, 4/20/76, combined with short, loud recordings of <span class="Italic">kīrtanas</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, the scientists make research. One does wrong thing to do that. So our process is to carry out the order of the higher authorities. So my Guru Mahārāja, my spiritual master, asked me to do this. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> But you led a rather normal life-before this you were married. You were a businessman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> What made you change suddenly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By this association. Just like we are holding meeting, and so many boys, girls, they come. If somebody is capturing the idea, he makes further progress. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Do you think the type of life that your devotees must lead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> ...is in fact a happy one, getting up very early in the morning...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is. It is. Just like if you are suffering from some ailments, so you have to follow some rules and regulation so that you may be cured. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Your Divine Grace, can I ask you how old you are now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> How old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am eighty years old. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> Do you make a lot of money out of the sales of your books, etc.? There is begging in the street each day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But there are many beggars. They do not get money. We get money. We are not beggars. We are giving books, knowledge. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Carol Jarvis:</span> I wonder if I could ask you just finally, then, if you have a message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the message, that people are under the impression that one is this body, but that is not the fact. The soul, or the man, he is within the body. Just like you are not your, this shirt and coat. (inserted <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Interviewer (1):</span> That was Carol Jarvis with the leader of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, a man with a message, and we hope you've taken note. Well, we'll be back in a moment, and this time with a surprise.... (end)</div>
