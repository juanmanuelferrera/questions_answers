<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mosquito?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughter) Many, many? Without mosquito curtain you cannot sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No, we can sleep. At Advaita Bhavan there's a fair amount of mosquitos at night, but there's not so many that you can't sleep without a mosquito coil burning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The rats in Hawaii are not so big as the rats here. They're only about this big, the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every house there is rats?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Not every house, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least Advaita Bhavan has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They were some but they cleaned them out. They got rid of them. I'm not sure rats actually are poisoned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> (unintelligible)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> We were getting a cow but we joined ISKCON just before we got the cow. We were going to get one for four hundred dollars. It was giving sixteen quarts a day and had a calf.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sixteen quarts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> A day, yes. There was a small calf also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There must be grazing ground for cows. Then there is no problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There was a grazing ground. The lawn must grow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Are they cutting? These are not important thing. (end)</div>
