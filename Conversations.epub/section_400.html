<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. If... They are very, very great, powerful. Even apparently it seems that they were victims of beauty, that is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If their son was Vyāsadeva, how could it be falldown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If the son was Vyāsadeva...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He could beget a child like Vyāsadeva. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading from <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span>) "Chapter Two. Prayers by the Demigods for Lord Kṛṣṇa in the Womb. King Kaṁsa not only occupied the kingdoms of the Yadu, Bhoja and Andhaka dynasties and the kingdom of Śūrasena..." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the only expense... [break] ...intention of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Kṛṣṇa and yog...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...he says, this <span class="Italic">mantra, nāyam ātmā bala-hīnā na labhya,</span> he says, "Unless you very, become very stout and strong, there is no question of advancement in spiritual life. Therefore we should first of all eat meat and become very strong, and then we'll be spiritual realized."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Who says that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vivekananda. [break] ...physical strength. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> ...Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa was transferred to Vṛndāvana. Not other (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Kṛṣṇa had other brothers and sisters besides Balarāma and Subhadrā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We hear only two. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Once I asked you that question in 1968, and you answered that Subhadrā sat on Kṛṣṇa's lap and smiled. That was her activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...maybe. Go on reading. [break] <span class="Italic">...asac chāstram pracchanaṁ bauddham ucyate.</span> The Māyāvāda is a very dangerous philosophy. It has made the whole world atheistic. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Māyāvādam asac-chāstraṁ pracchanaṁ bauddham ucyate.</span> They cannot understand that this is a dangerous philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He comes to the <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> but then he says that you don't have to worship Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He comes to <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> but he says to us that "You don't have to go to worship Kṛṣṇa in the temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we haven't got to learn from you. We have got better teacher than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I told him like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chants <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break]. They'll talk of Kṛṣṇa, so many things but they're not devotees. Just like Kaṁsa. They may talk of Kṛṣṇa or think of Kṛṣṇa, but they don't accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. Therefore they are demons. This is the test. They'll read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but they'll not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. And that is the demonic. <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> Because they are demons, therefore their so-called knowledge is useless. <span class="Italic">Apahṛta-jñāna.</span> And apparently, they seem to be very learned scholar, but there is no knowledge. There is no knowledge. This is the demonic... Just like Rāvaṇa. He was very much advanced student in Vedic literature. But he was a demon. So simply by studying <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> one does not become out of the jurisdiction of demons. Just like Jarasandha. He was also worshiping Viṣṇu. But he was a demon. He was a demon. His purpose was different. The yajñic <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they also could not understand Kṛṣṇa. So this is the crucial test. If one does not understand Kṛṣṇa and become submissive to surrender, he remains a demon, however big scholar he may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> That is a division of <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> Patel and Parsees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Don't mention anyone. This is the general definition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> They were saying that you are not speaking <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they know about <span class="Italic">Vedas?</span> If they did know, then they should have stuck up in family life, in <span class="Italic">kūpa-māṇḍukya</span> and <span class="Italic">gṛhambhara,</span> they have. They do not know what is <span class="Italic">Vedas. Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">. Vedas</span> means to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is knowledge of <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is the special quality of Kali-yuga, that <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> class people will take up the preaching of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And even followers of Śaṅkarācārya... Śaṅkarācārya does not give anyone any recognition unless he's a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> That is the strict principle of Śaṅkara <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> They are <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhis</span> and they are thinking they are advanced in spiritual consciousness. Śaṅkarācārya does not give anyone any position unless he is in the renounced order of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> [break] ...sign of a great devotee is also to be always absorbed in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore in their <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> it is a custom, as soon as he takes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> he becomes Nārāyaṇa. <span class="Italic">"Namo nārāyaṇa.</span>" (laughs) That is an allurement. So this... Even one says that he is follower of Śaṅkarācārya, but there is no meaning in it. Unless one is a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> he cannot say that he is follower of Śaṅkarācārya. Śaṅkarācārya took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> at the age of eight years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> He died about thirty-nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thirty-two. [break] ...never think what is the truth of life. Everyone. So somebody is taking sense gratification as truth of life. Somebody is taking mental speculation as truth of life. So many ways. But <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">].</span> We worship the Supreme Truth. <span class="Italic">Namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.</span> The Supreme Truth. [break] ...say Brahmā, <span class="Italic">oṁ.</span> Not Rāma, Kṛṣṇa. No, they'll never say. Sometimes they say, "Nārāyaṇa." That is, means thinking himself as Nārāyaṇa. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> this <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa,</span> that <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇa,</span> Swami Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then they want to serve Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya Rāmji. Jaya Rāmji. Jaya Rāmji.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then they, then they take the philosophy, "I want to serve Nārāyaṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "No, I want to become Nārāyaṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, then they want to serve themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not "serve Nārāyaṇa." "I want to become Nārāyaṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If they are Nārāyaṇa, they serve themselves. So then they serve Nārāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] There you see the Sarasvatī. Sarasvatī, she asks anybody, "Do you know Kṛṣṇa?" He will say, "No, I do not know..." "The Supreme Personality of Godhead." (laughter) She... That is preaching. And she'll collect some money and bring it to me. From the very childhood. [break] <span class="Italic">...evāsam āgre.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> "And when everything will be finished, I'll stay." That is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Janmādyasya yataḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> says that "He is the cause of creation, maintenance and annihilation." Brahmā, Viṣṇu, Maheśvara. [break] One who takes shelter of that birth, who is not interested in this distress and happiness, he also becomes of this <span class="Italic">Mad-bhāva.</span> That verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Mad-bhāva yānti mām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Vīta-rāga-bhaya-śoka, mad-bhāva upagamya. Bahu...</span> What is that? I forget now, this... <span class="Italic">Vīta... Yajña... Pūtā. Mad-bhāvam adhigacchati. Mad-bhāvam</span> means by devotional service one attains the nature of Kṛṣṇa, no more interested with the material distress and material happiness. That does not affect them. That is the... That is also stated in another place of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ cavyabhicāriṇi<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.26]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He also becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20].</span> Just like if you be in touch with the fire, then you become also warm. The quality of fire is warmth. So if you keep yourself always, constantly in touch with the fire, you also become warm. So this Kṛṣṇa's qualification, that He's not affected by the material happiness and distress, can be attained by anyone who always keeps his association with Kṛṣṇa. Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">...prasannātmā. Brahma-bhūta.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta</span> stage. <span class="Italic">Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> This happiness and distress is the cause of <span class="Italic">śocati</span> and <span class="Italic">kāṅkṣati. Kāṅkṣati</span> means desiring to have something. This is distress. And lamenting for something, that is also distress. Actually, this is the material position. When we haven't got the things, we desire it. That is also distress. And when it is lost, that is also distress. But by illusion, they take it. When they get it, they think that it is happiness. This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Actually, to get the things, he has to undergo so much hard... A man is given credit... Suppose he was a poor man. He has now become multi-millionaire. He is given credit. But he does not see that he has simply passed through distress. But he... By illusion, he's thinking that he's happy. He's also thinking, and others also thinking, that "He has become happy." But actually it is distress. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (chants <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...people become religious not for attaining the transcendental stage, but for material benefit, <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> the <span class="Italic">artha. Artha</span> means material opulence, that. They... These four things: <span class="Italic">dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90].</span> And why they want <span class="Italic">artha?</span> To satisfy their senses. <span class="Italic">Dharma artha kāma...</span> And when they're again baffled, they want <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> to become one with the Supreme. These are the four different tastes of the material. All, all of them are baffling and illusory. The so-called religiosity with a view to get some material profit... That comes everywhere. Just (as) in Christianity, the religion means, "O God, give us our daily bread." Material profit, similarly, in anywhere, they go for material benefit. Therefore this kind of religion, it is also good, but it not first-class. The first-class religion is <span class="Italic">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">,</span> when one is awakened to the devotional service of the Lord, <span class="Italic">ahaitukī apratihatā,</span> without any cause, and without being impeded. So <span class="Italic">ahaitukī apratihatā...</span> That is, that stage is required. Not that "My sense gratification is not done here. Oh, let us give up this company." That is sense gratification. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading from <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span>) "According to the different associations in the three modes of material nature, the living entities are tasting different kinds of religiosity..." [break] "...kinds of..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That religiosity also different kinds: rajasic, tamasic, and sattvic, according to one's nature. The sattvic, they worship Viṣṇu. The rajasic, they worship the demigods. And the tamasic, they worship <span class="Italic">bhūta, preta, piśāca...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Demons. You'll see the Mohammedans, they worship the tomb. And Christian also, they worship the tomb. They offer wreath on the tomb. So tamasic. What is there in the tomb? But because they're tamasic, they're worshiping like that. And this, this so-called incarnation worship is also tamasic. By tamasic, in darkness they accept somebody as incarnation, and they worship. This is tamasic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If someone said to us that "You are worshiping <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span>" what is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Samādhi,</span> we are offering respect to the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Yes. Not that we are simply worshiping <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> We are worshiping Kṛṣṇa also, side by side. It is not that... Then <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> worship is finished. That is <span class="Italic">ācārya. Ācārya</span> is, although worshiped as the Supreme Lord, but the Lord is also worshiped. And these Māyāvādīs, they give up the worship of Lord. So therefore they are Māyāvādīs. In Māyāvādī temple you'll find the picture of the guru and not the picture of Kṛṣṇa. I have seen in Surat, one temple of "Rāma." There is no Rāma. Guru is Rāma. That's all. <span class="Italic">Guru brahma,</span> (Hindi) [break] <span class="Italic">...caittya-guru,</span> because he has merged into the existence of Lord, he has become Lord. "Merging-Lord. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> merging<span class="Italic">-nārāyaṇa.</span>" This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The Jains have the same kind of philosophy also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone. All philosophies, they are more or less Māyāvāda. All Māyāvāda. Different types of Māyāvāda philosophy. Therefore they should be discarded. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Thank you very much. What you are, all students?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Students:</span> Yes. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Student:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen our temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Student:</span> Not seen your temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? You are not interested in Kṛṣṇa philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That's right. They are very interested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The... Every young boy, or even young child... <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> And that is the instruction of Prahlāda Mahārāja. He was a five years old child, and he was teaching his class friends Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So in that teaching he said... The other children, they said, "Why you are teaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Let us play." So he answered, "No, no, my dear friends." <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān iha.</span> This science, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-dharma,</span> should be learned from the very beginning of life. That is Vedic culture. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārīs,</span> they were living at the place of guru and learning this science. That is Vedic culture. [break] ...boys of Europe and America, they are accepting this Vedic culture. Why you are keeping aloof? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They are praying, but not showing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They are praying, but not showing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So they are showing only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> No, no, no. It is not only showing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That means "We pray at home."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pray at home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secretly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Not secretly. Just before others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That's all right. If you are praying, it is all right. But our proposal is that you have to understand the science. Prayer is very good, but if one offers prayer after knowing the science, that is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> So we are also giving the knowledge about the science, science of Kṛṣṇa philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Are we giving the knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Giving knowledge about science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He means material science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material science? No, no, I am talking of Kṛṣṇa science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> About the existence of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only existence. What is God, first of all. He must exist. Otherwise, where there is question of "What is God?" So what is the nature of God, what is our position, what is our relationship with God, what is our duty, and what is the goal of life, these things are very thoroughly discussed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So if we understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> very nicely, then we understand the whole science of God. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...that Kṛṣṇa comes, descends personally, to settle up the contention whether God is person or imperson. So even the Kṛṣṇa's presence cannot convince these Māyāvādīs, poor fund of knowledge, that Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord is person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading:) "Somehow people can understand the different incarnations of Your Lordship, but they are puzzled to understand the eternal form of Kṛṣṇa with two hands, moving among human beings exactly like one of them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...them, the form is meant for killing them, chastising them. Therefore dangerous. <span class="Italic">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> So for the nondevotees the form is very dangerous. <span class="Italic">Sadā paśyanti yoginaḥ.</span> Yogis, they concentrate their mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is in the Tenth Canto. <span class="Italic">Bhavāmbudhir vatsa-padam.</span> Just like this ocean, if it becomes a small pit, then don't require a big ship to cross over. You just... Like this. It can be reduced. By Kṛṣṇa's desire, it can be done so. Just like at the present moment... Formerly, people used to go to London from India, from Bombay, at least, in fifteen days. Now it doesn't take even fifteen hours. It takes only nine hours. How it has been reduced? Because there is a process to reduce. Similarly, the supreme spiritual process is like that. It can be reduced to any quantity. <span class="Italic">Aṇi...</span> This is called <span class="Italic">aṇimā-siddhi.</span> It can be expanded also, to the greatest length. <span class="Italic">Mahimā-śakti.</span> All-powerful means not that "I cannot do, I cannot, I can do this only." No, anything He can do. That is all powerful. <span class="Italic">Aṇimā, laghimā, mahimā.</span> Just like all these big, big planets, they are floating in the sky. This is called <span class="Italic">laghimā,</span> weightless, no weight. Those who are going to the moon planet, they are finding out weightlessness. How it has become weightless? Such a big, huge... Just this planet. With so many seas and mountains and cities and buildings. But it is floating. That's a fact. It is floating like a swab. How it is floating? You can say something nonsense, but the actual fact is this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> You give the example in <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...that when the..., dead bodies will sink in the water, but a live, when the body has life, it can float on water. So when Kṛṣṇa enters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...impregnates...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...material nature, it can become weightless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. A dead body immediately goes down in the water, but a living body floats. So this is the example, that because <span class="Italic">viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthita.</span> Because Kṛṣṇa enters this material world as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, as Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, therefore it floats. Just like this airplane. It is floating so long the pilot is there. If the pilot is not there, it will not float, however good machine it may be. It will not float; it will come down. These are the ex... [break] ...soul, the spiritual spark, even in minute quantity, it can float the heaviest matter. This is the conclusion. [break] ...so high and if the pilot is killed some way or other, no more floating, come down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> So this <span class="Italic">laghimā siddhi</span> is also being attained by the material scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> This is also a <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> that they can invent a plane...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. To some extent. By material arrangement... The yogis can do still more. Without any material machine, they can float. They can walk on the water, becomes light. [break] <span class="Italic">...man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the process. [break] ...colleges, the students are being educated that there is no God. And they expect good behavior from them. And when they set fire in the bus, that is... "The students are so dangerous now." But you have made them dangerous. The educational system. They are protesting against the existence of God. [break] ...so-called swamis. And they are also accelerating, "yes, no more. There is no God. Why you are searching God anywhere? There are so many gods loitering in the street. They are God." That is the statement of Vivekananda. "Why you are finding out, trying to find out God elsewhere. These are Gods." [break] ...if required, one may come, very easily, one may take some time. But we should go on preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (3):</span> No, exactly. We should not do anything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. [break] ...American, rude. That is my experience. He may not agree with my philosophy. [break] ...the reason is that they are not poverty-stricken. Yes. When one becomes poverty-stricken, his all good qualities become null and void. <span class="Italic">Daridra-doṣa guṇa-rāśi nāśī.</span> Our country is now poverty-stricken. Therefore we have lost our all good qualities. [break] ...loss is that we have lost our culture, original Vedic culture. That is the greatest loss. When the culture was that one man was trying to kill one cow, and immediately Mahārāja Parīkṣit wanted to take step against him. Now just see how much that culture has gone down. Here ten thousand, twelve thousand cows are being killed regularly under government management. You see. [break] ...for stopping cow-killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (3):</span> But even then they don't listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Even Gandhi refused. Gandhi was approached by the... "Mahātmāji, you can stop this cow-killing." He replied, "How can I stop? It is their religion." Just see. [break] <span class="Italic">...kṛṣi go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the duty of the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (3):</span> They are Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are Hindus. [break] ...travelling with a Mohammedan. At that time there was no Second Class, Inter Class or Second Class I was. So that Mohammedan gentleman, when he called for that food supply, so he was asking very... "Is there any meat, cow's flesh?" "No, no, sir. No, sir." "That's all right." (end)</div>
