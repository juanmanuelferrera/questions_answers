<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...need of God or not? Whether there is need of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The scientists say no, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They say there's neither need, nor usefulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their rascaldom. What is your opinion, scientist? There is need of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They may say that there is no necessity, but the fact is that there must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Otherwise they, we cannot conceive of how things are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like in the modern days, government, they have abolished monarchism, but still, why they elect a president? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Must be leadership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Must be. That is the point. If you have abolished monarchy, then why you are electing another rascal to become a monarch? What is the answer? Why do you need it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because they need law and order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there must be. In our organization... Just like in each temple we elect a president. Then we get GBC. Then above all, I am. So that is needed. It is not conventional. It is needed. Therefore above everything, there must be God. So if these people, they say, "There is no need of God, there is no use for Him," that means they are all rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They themselves want to be that God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter. You become God. But our point is there is need of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, on that basis, on that logic they would say, "Yes, there is need, but we can fill that need."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You fill, that's all right, but if you cannot... That is the question. (laughter) Our definition of God is that He maintains everyone. Can you maintain everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They are thinking they are maintaining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They again thinking. What is your present position? You are maintained. You cannot maintain. You are maintained by your boss. He gives you some salary and you fill up your bellies. You rascal, you want to be maintainer. You cannot maintain even a family of five heads. Therefore we say, all full of rascals. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto...</span> That is our śāstric conclusion. Anyone who is atheist, nondevotee, he is a rascal number one. <span class="Italic">Bās.</span> It doesn't matter what post he holds. Our conclusion is that he is a rascal number one. That's all. He cannot have any good qualification. There is need of God. Who will maintain? Just like children. They require care of the parents. The people require the care of a head man, executive. This is essential. You cannot do without God. Who is maintaining that the moon is exactly in time rising, exactly in time setting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Only God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Under whose order it is being done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll say, "By nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you mean, "By nature"? That is another rascaldom. Why this wood is not moving by nature unless somebody comes and moves?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They will say, "That is just the way things are."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it stops. Your body is moving. But when it stops, you cannot make just the way it is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They also say, "That is also by nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that nature? Nature means an instrument. Instrument, there must be one player. Nature is instrument. Just like this is an instrument. It is not recording by itself. When you push the button, then it works. You cannot say that "It is working by nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They might say that by "nature" they mean it happens naturally. What's happening naturally, they mean it doesn't require anyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what things are happening naturally? Your father begets you, therefore you talk. Naturally you have not come. If your father would not begotten you through your mother, how did you come? Naturally your mother does not become pregnant. What things happening naturally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. By the father impregnating the mother, that is natural, naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why naturally? If father does not pregna... There are so many now "bachelor-daddies." Nothing can be took natural. Nature is an instrument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say that some say that nothing was actually ever created, so there is no need for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is created. That is rascaldom. He is speaking. He is created by his father, the rascal who is talking like that. You were created by your father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, but essentially, he says, they are not created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not created? I see that your mother became pregnant and you were created and you are... Why you say... Your natural... Your mother did not become naturally pregnant. Everything is created. This table is created. You cannot say that it has come naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> This form may be created or it exists at a certain state of time, but the energy is never created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that also we admit. That is another thing. But the... Therefore we have got two departments, the spiritual world and the material world. In the material world everything is created. In the spiritual world, not created. It is ever-existing. And anything which is created, that is annihilated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The energy is not annihilated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That we also accept. But that energy belongs to whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say that because it was never created, it doesn't have to be created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This material world is created. That you cannot say, "It is not created." Everything we see in our front, everything is created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say, "Nothing is created."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Created, in this sense, it is manifested.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In that sense. But that still isn't the creation of the energy itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... What is that energy? That is spiritual energy. Therefore we divide material energy and spiritual energy. In the spiritual energy everything is manifested and non-manifested. And the spiritual energy, everything is ever-existing. <span class="Italic">Sanātana, sanātana. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20]. Sanātana</span> means ever-existing. There is another nature, but that is not this nature. That we admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But if this energy was never created, then what is the need for a creator?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We admit the energy is not created. But energy comes from the energetic. Energy. Just like you may become angry. So that anger energy is there in you, but it is not manifested. So there are certain energies which sometimes manifested, sometimes not manifested. So this energy, material energy, is of God. This energy is sometimes manifested, sometimes not manifested. But there is another energy which is eternal. That is spiritual world. That is our... This is scientific study. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They will say that such talk may be of use in a religious sphere, but it has no use ultimately in terms of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere it is useful because in scientific world also, you follow leader, Sir Isaac Newton, Professor Einstein. Why do you follow? There must be a leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they just use the leaders as springboards. They don't accept them as absolute authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it may be springboard, but you have to take their help. Because it is springboard, you cannot neglect. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you have to take help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They feel great accomplishment when they can disprove something that these leaders are proposing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if the leader is rascal, then it is accepted. But a leader required, that's a fact. But if you select a wrong leader, then you are misguided. But leader is required. Just like to get birth, there must be a father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Leader is someone whose words can be accepted. A leader is someone, or a scientist, it doesn't matter, anybody, whose words are followed by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, authority. Leader means authority. His instruction is followed, and actually it happens. That is leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> [break] ...scientific community. It changes so often...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are not leader, perfect leader. With imperfect knowledge they become leader. Therefore we... Our process is to accept a leader who is perfect. That is our process. And the others, fools, they accept a leader who is not perfect. But either we or they, they must accept a leader. The only difference is that we accept the perfect leader and they accept the imperfect leader. Therefore they are cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They will not accept the conception of perfection. They say, "We do not accept this term perfection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they are fools, therefore they are fooled. Unless there is conception of perfection, why do you change leader? Why do you make revolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The lesser of two evils.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They accept the conception, but they don't accept the reality of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Reality, because they do not know. They have been always been misguided by rascals. Therefore they cannot think of that there can be perfection. This is called skepticism. Because everyone is faulty, therefore there is no knowledge. This is skeptism. But real knowledge is that as I see this man is intelligent that man, that man is intelligent than that man, therefore there is an ideal intelligent man which we could not find. And that is God. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Just like when they go and excavate a city under the ground, an old city, they see that so many things were built, and they say, "Oh, these people were very intelligent." Although they never saw the person, they saw the civilization in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By symptoms, by symptoms they can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> So they say, "Well, we cannot see God." But they could not see the people in those past days either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You cannot see the government, but when things are going nicely, you must accept, there is government. That is... When things are going on very nicely, regularly, the sun is rising regularly, the moon is rising regularly, the seasons are changing and the waves are flowing, everything, then you have to accept that there is government. And as we have got experience here in this material world... Government is impersonal, but that at the end there is a president. Similarly, the whole government, the complete government, may be impersonal in the beginning, but at the end there is a person, that Supreme Person, Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> Yes. Paramātmā is representative of God. Just like the president has got so many representative governors, similarly, Paramātmā is the localized representative of God, and God is person, and the whole government is impersonal. This is the conception. When we say "government," you cannot localize that "Who is that person, government?" That is impersonal. But when we find governor, then localized persons. And then above them, all of them, when there is president, he is supreme person. This is our practical example. Similarly, nature is working impersonally, but there are officers. They are called demigods. And above them all there is the Supreme Lord. He is Bhagavān. And this idea wherefrom has come? The president, the governors, and the government. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> It has come from there. Because of the origin, the same thing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They will say, Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are rascals. They will say anything. (laughter) But this is the fact. When a madman speaks, he speaks all nonsense. But we are not madmen. We cannot accept their version. What they will say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Even in a group of chickens, there is one who is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother chicken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The head chicken. Or monkeys. There is also what's called pecking order. One is at the top, and then there's one at the end who gets the least, and all these gradations in-between. In any group there is always like that. So they say simply the reason we have government with one man head is because that's the natural pecking order like chickens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. Why this natural order has come? It is needed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say chance. Chance in nature...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no chance. That is rascaldom. There is no chance. There is no chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> By their theory of evolution, selectivity, that whatever develops, develops out of necessity, but not out of design.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is design. They do not know it. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10].</span> It is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhaga... Adhyakṣeṇa</span> means "under My superintendence." That means under some plan. What is the plan of this material world? The plan of material world is that some rascals, living entities, they wanted to enjoy. So God has given this plan, "All right, you enjoy." This is the plan. And not only enjoy. "You enjoy; again come back." This is the plan. <span class="Italic">Pravṛtti-nivṛtti.</span> First of all he is given that "All right, you take all facilities of enjoyment." Therefore <span class="Italic">Veda</span> is that "You enjoy like this, and after you have fulfilled your enjoyment, come back again." This is God mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is a testing ground of the spirit soul, a testing platform, where we can experience what we wanted, and after that, we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We wanted to enjoy. We wanted to enjoy. God has given full freedom to enjoy, but this enjoyment is not perfect. Therefore God comes. He says, "Now you have enjoyed, but you have not enjoyed. You have simply suffered. Therefore please come back again." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> If we don't experience, we may not know that we are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because we have got little freedom. Therefore this freedom is given, "All right..." So by freedom, sometimes we are becoming Lord Brahmā and sometimes the germ in the stool. This is going on. Otherwise, why there are so many different types of living entities? That freedom is acting under three modes: <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa,</span> and <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span> And when they are multiplied, three into three equals nine, nine into eighty-one; therefore 8,400,000 species. They experience everything. That is evolution, coming down, again going up, coming down again. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So when they become exasperated, "No more." They want to become merging into the Supreme. When they are fatigued. After being <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> then <span class="Italic">jñānī:</span> "This is not good. What is actually our aim of life, let us search out." But because they make research in their teeny brain, they come to the conclusion, voidism and impersonalism, that "Make it zero, this botheration." That is also imperfect. So when they come to Bhagavān and engage himself in the service, then it is perfect, original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They want things by experimental knowledge, and when they fail it, they say it is nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is voidism. First of all they try to enjoy. When they fail... The jackal in the orchard first of all tried to get the grapes, jumping, jumping, jumping. When he could not get, then he said, "Oh it is sour. Don't require..." (laughter) They will say, <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā:</span> "This is all false. Let us go to Brahman." This is their philosophy. First of all they try as <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> brmmmmmmm. (Prabhupāda makes loud car sound) (laughter) When all these brm brm brm, life after life, when he finds that there is nothing, "Oh, it is all false. Grapes are sour." Jackal jumping. There is need of God. You can write article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Need of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is need, absolute need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> And need to trust in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Exactly like that. A child needs parents and absolute surrender to parents. That is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> He needs parents to be born at all, he need parents that he can rely on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that he may grow. That Upendra's wife and child. The child is so restless, not for a single moment. And the mother has to take care, "No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no." She requires a mother to take care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the child is automatically taken care of by the parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but he does not know. Child is foolish. He does not know. Similarly, everything is taken care of by God. He is supplying food, He is supplying seasons, He is supplying lights, everything I require. But we are so rascals, we are denying Him. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say there are discrepancies in that supply. Some people starve to death and freeze to death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is not discrepancy. Just like a mother, when the child is diseased, "Ah, don't take. You cannot take. You must starve." If he thinks it is discrepancy, that is his foolishness. That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, just like if a big tornado comes and kills a thousand people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because on account of their sins. Because they do not know. Why government hangs one person? Is there government discrepancy? When government says, the judge says, "This man must be hanged," is it discrepancy? It is justice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, just like that one Indian chemist Svarūpa Dāmodara brought. He said that philosophy is killing India. People just sit by and watch each other die instead of trying to help each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that he is rascal. No Indian is dying. We are going three times, four times India. Who is dying? Everyone is dying natural death. This is all propaganda, to make their position secure. That's all. I have never seen anyone dying for starvation. I have pointed out so many times that fifty years ago this class of men lying on the footpath... Now the foodgrains has risen price fifty times. Still he is living. Still he is living. But he has to live in that condition. Although he must have increased his income, otherwise how he is purchasing foodstuff, fifty times? But in spite of his increasing income, he must live like that. Apart from India. Why, in your country or in Europe, so many hippies are lying? Why? They have no want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But not as many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have not seen Amsterdam. Full, one big park, hundreds and thousands hippies are lying on the ground. Hundreds and thousands. You have been in Amsterdam? I have seen it personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yeah. But not like India where there is millions of people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, India you will not find that in the park hundreds and thousands are lying. You never find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, you'll find them living in sewer pipes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, our proposition is that one class of men must lie down like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their business. They must.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Just like there they build big buildings for them and let them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not go. In Bombay also, municipality has constructed big buildings, but they do not go. They hire it, yes, they get, to some gentleman. They get some fifty rupees and "All right, you take." And he lives in a hut. Yes. This is practical. They don't like. Just like a worm in the stool. You take it away. He will again, again go. (laughter) Again go there. You are very philanthropist: "Oh, my dear friend, why you are in the stool? Come on, here." "No, no, sir, I will go there again." How can you check it? Nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say it can be checked by time and education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that time, you wait for time. By that time you will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, just like a hundred years ago in the United States...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. These discrepancies will go on because this whole material world is being conducted by three qualities. You will have three qualitative persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they think they are making progress...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they are making progress everyone knows, what kind of progress they are making.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there was a great philosopher or preacher among the Jewish people whose position is that "If there is God and He let so many Jews be killed by Hitler, ten million Jews, and God could have stopped it and He didn't, then I don't care for that God." They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So their God, Jesus Christ God, he could not even protect himself also. The reply should be, Christian, if Jesus Christ is God, then why he could not protect himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, the Jews say Jesus Christ wasn't God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, but somebody said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It is just like the concept that if God is all-merciful, why He is so impartial, somebody making happy, somebody making suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is mercifulness. Just like when doctor says, "You don't take anything today. You fast," that is mercy. That is mercy. It is good for him. By starving, he will be cured. That is mercy. And according to <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā,</span> when a man is hanged, that is mercy. If he is hanged... He has committed murder. He should be hanged so all his sinful reaction finished. Otherwise next birth, he has to suffer. He has to be killed by somebody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the tendency is that the sufferer wants to complain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that they will complain. Just like when a man is ordered to be hanged, he will complain, "Just see the police, judge. He has ordered me to be hanged." That complaint will go on. Just like a child. When the doctor says, "Don't eat anything." He will complain. He will cry, "Why doctor says like that?" But it has to be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, then they'll say, "Well, if you see somebody suffering, then why do anything about it, if it just what they..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are doing everything to stop his suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They will say, "Why? If that's what they deserve, why try to stop it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because he has come here to suffer. You cannot expect in the prison life a very comfortable life. You must suffer. But if somebody goes there, that "Don't commit stealing anymore. Come out and don't come here again," so that is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Just because a man goes in the prisonhouse doesn't mean his thieving is cured. He will come out a thief unless he is actually rectified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes. Otherwise again he will commit the same thing and again he will come. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore he requires instruction, good instruction. Sometimes government invites. We were invited that Ahmedabad jail. You remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, there was big meeting of the prisoners. <span class="Italic">Kīrtana,</span> everything, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So by lacking the understanding, they say that God is not merciful. The sufferers. People, who are suffering, but by not knowing that it is the mercy of the Lord, we complain that God is not merciful. But he is impartial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God is merciful, but this fool does not know because he is ignorant. The same thing, mother says. One child, she is feeding very sumptuously. Other one, "Oh, don't take it. You go away." Does it mean the mother is merciful to one child and not to the other? The child does not know it, he cries, "Why shall I not...? Why I shall not eat? Why I shall not eat?" So these foolish questions will be stopped as soon as one becomes God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But unless they understand the difference between spirit and matter, they can't accept this logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, foolish men cannot accept any logic. Their logic is stick. "If you don't accept, I shall kick on your face. Accept it." That is the... That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Like the example when Hitler killed the Jews. They will say, "Well, what should we do, just let Hitler go on killing the Jews because the Jews were sinful? Or should we try and stop Hitler?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Hitler was imperfect and everything was imperfect. That you cannot compare Hitler's action with God's action. God is all-perfect. That is first proposition. God is all-perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That may be accepted in retrospection, but when it is happening, they don't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is their ignorance, foolishness. Therefore a devotee will not say like that. A devotee will say, <span class="Italic">tat te 'nukampāṁ susamīkṣamāṇaḥ: [</span><span class="calibre3">SB</span> 10.14.8] "My dear Lord, I am suffering. It is due to my past mischievous activities, but you are rescuing me by giving little punishment. I would have been punished more, but you have given little punishment. Thank you very much." This is devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, what if someone came here now to attack us, should I just sit there and watch him and say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Who said? You must fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, why? If we are attacked, then we must deserve it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it may be that somebody is attacking even you do not deserve. So therefore you have got intelligence. You have got hands. You must try to protect. Just like one man is destined to be hanged, but still, he appoints a lawyer and tries to save him. He knows that "I have committed murder, I must be hanged."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> And then God sanctions the judge. The judge can kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that is why they say we must work to help poor people and starving people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why poor people? You starve. You are already yourself a poor people. How you can help them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, they say if we find poor and starving people, we must go and feed them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you feed them. But we also feed them. But we feed them with Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> That is the difference. You do this. That will be actually beneficial. By distributing Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> you will be benefited, they will be benefited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> If we see a group of demons fighting, killing each other, should devotees go and try to stop them from killing each other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you must know whether they are demons. But demons fight. Gentlemen do not fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Let them fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them fight. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The devotees should wish that "O my Lord, please..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotees must pray that "This great demon Hiraṇyakaśipu may be killed by You, my Lord." Therefore He comes. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja passively... [break] ...father was being killed. He could have stopped it, but he did not. He did not. If Prahlāda Mahārāja would have requested, immediately it would have been stopped, but he did not. He said, rather, in his prayer, that "Nobody is sorry when a serpent or a scorpion is killed." He said like that. So he said, "My father was just like a serpent and scorpion. Now he is killed. So now You become pacified. No more need of becoming angry." <span class="Italic">Modeta sādhur api.</span> Actually, I have seen. There was a snake in our Māyāpura temple. So Guru Mahārāja was standing on the..., while some devotees were waiting. "Yes, kill it." So at that time I could not understand that "Such a saintly person why he is ordering to kill a snake?" Then when I found in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā:</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 7.9.14] "A saintly person also becomes engladdened when a snake is killed." Because it is very harmful. He said that "He will do so many harmful activities. Better kill him." Because his business is to create harm. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> A snake attacks without discrimination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He is mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply if you are passing by... Just like dog. Without any fault, bark, "Wowf! Wowf! Wowf! Worf!" This is the animal nature. Without any fault, I am passing, I am not entering his gate. Still, the dog will bark. Similarly, the snake... You simply pass through. He will feel pleasure, biting you. That is snake's business. Therefore nobody is merciful upon snake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Because of his poison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] There was a snake. He was living under my bed. So you know <span class="Italic">katiya?</span> (?) The rope, <span class="Italic">katiya?</span> So I saw something is hanging like snake tail. So I called my servant, "There must be some snake. Some tail is hanging." So the servant, they called all their friends. They came with stick, about a dozen. And as soon as the mattress was taken, there was snake. So I told them, "Don't kill it. No, no." <span class="Italic">"Nei saheb, yei nei hatya.</span>" (?) Ah, immediately killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Once there was a big cobra, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in home in Manipura, in our kitchen. He was just coiling and just sitting there, but he was very mild, because he was about to skin his skin. By that time, he doesn't bite anything, very tame.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, sometimes the serpents are tamed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. But still, they are dangerous. That is said by Cāṇakya Paṇḍita. The serpent is so dangerous. That, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said. The serpent is so dangerous that even one imagines there is a serpent, he is, becomes afraid. You see? When Mahārāja Pratāparudra wanted to see Him and Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and others requested, that "He is a devotee." "But I know that he is a devotee, but because he is king, therefore I cannot see him." He gave this encou..., "The serpent even by imagination is also fearful." He said like that. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita said, <span class="Italic">manina bhujitaḥ sarpa kim asau na bhayaṁkaraḥ.</span> (?) A serpent... You know, sometimes they have got jewel. "So a serpent with jewel, does it mean that he is not fearful?" Even with jewel he is fearful. Therefore, the demon, even with high educational qualification, he is rascal. He is rascal, fearful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> That high education is just like the jewel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But still fearful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> But Haridāsa Ṭhākura, he had a serpent in his cave that he was not so much fearful of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I said that, that sometimes, serpents are tame, friendly, everything, with jewel. But still they are fearful. Still, they are fearful. They cannot be trusted. A demon may be your friend, but you cannot trust him. <span class="Italic">Manina bhujitaḥ sarpa kim asau na bhayaṁkaraḥ.</span> (?) Just like (laughing) your sky in the western world. However clear it may be, you cannot trust. At any moment there will be cloud. Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Especially in London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am therefore speaking, western world. So what is the London news, Jaya Hari? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...in what sense is the First Canto His lotus feet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lotus feet because we worship Kṛṣṇa by worshiping the lotus feet first. We offer flower to the lotus feet. So one must go from First Canto to Second Canto, Third Canto, gradually make progress, not all of a sudden want to see how Kṛṣṇa is smiling. You see? That you cannot understand. So the <span class="Italic">sahajiyās,</span> they go, immediately jump to the Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā,</span> without worshiping gradually. Therefore they misunderstand. [break] Just to understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> But Kṛṣṇa's disappearance, about having a <span class="Italic">māyā</span> body that He left behind. A <span class="Italic">māyā</span> body. Is that anything to do with <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī</span> means those who are in <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> those who are thinking Kṛṣṇa as one of the human beings, for them, to delude them, He left the body. But actually He departed in His own body. There is no question of... Here is another... But just like this is also, this material world... This is also Kṛṣṇa's body. But this is interesting to the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> the so-called scientists, so-called philosophers. But it is not interesting to the devotees. They are thinking, "This is all." Is not that? The scientists, the philosophers, they are thinking, "This is all. There is nothing beyond this." This is illusion. This is only reflection of the reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvareta:</span> Scientists, they have their mental process, but what is our process to understand this knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ascending. Ah, descending, not ascending. We have to take knowledge from superior. We should not try ourself to know. That will be imperfect. <span class="Italic">Avaroha-patha.</span> Just like we're receiving knowledge from Kṛṣṇa. We are not researching. Those who are researching, they cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. They understand Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being, maybe little learned. That's all. The Dr. Frog's calculation of Atlantic Ocean. That's all. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> [break] ...automatically. You see? But he does not know that behind this automation there is brain. He'll see, "Oh, how nice." That's all. Similarly, child-like scientist, they will say, "Everything is going on automatically." [break] ...but there is brain behind that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But for the child, the presents at Christmas do appear automatically by the grace of the parents. So the fruits appear automatically by the grace of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> The main thing is that their leaders have no qualifications. And our leader has all qualifications. Our leader has all qualifications.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, because they are perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Therefore all-auspiciousness appears by your presence, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but why they, you accept it? You have got independence also. Acceptance and rejection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> English car, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rolls Royce. Not only English, you could not. (laughter) You could not, but he has done. Sometimes Śyāmasundara is envious of Karandhara. Now, just see what is the difference. He has taken twenty thousand dollars. He cannot pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
