<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your country, America, is very much eager to kill these Communists. And the Communists are also very eager. So very soon there will be war. And perhaps India will be the greatest sufferer.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Srutakirti:</span> Sufferer.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They are... Friendship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Side by side. If the war is started from India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So India will become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the Russians are ready here already, I have heard, with soldiers and... Not soldiers. I mean to say.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Will that help our preaching, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching will be very nice after the war when both of them, especially Russia, will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They want to make India the battleground?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Also, Prabhupāda, Atreya Ṛṣi said that the Arabs are preparing for the war. They're buying billions and billions of dollars worth of missiles and jets and tanks from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so they are being prepared. War will soon start.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> The Arab men all go to America to be trained in the armed forces there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> In all the armed forces centers in America, they train the Arab nations to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> They let the young men come into the U.S.A. to learn how to use the missiles and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Recently, this Bhutto of Pakistan, he was very happy because they were talking about lifting a ten-year holding on arms from the United States, and now, they say, Pakistan will soon get arms from America.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Oh! Whew!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pakistan will start a war... (devotees talking among themselves.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> They have started the war maybe eight times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Aside:) Hmm? No, we can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> What will the devotees do while the war is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got only business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Will we stay in the cities or will...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can stay anywhere. We have got our Māyāpur, Vṛndāvana. But the danger is the government will say that "All Americans go away." That is the danger. I am thinking of that position. What shall I do at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take Indian citizenship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Indian citizenship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you take, it is very nice. Then they will ask you to go to war. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will this war spread to many different countries and continents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The actual war will be between America and Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> What about British devotees, British citizens? Would the British be asked to leave, British citizens? Commonwealth citizens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Britishers are now finished. They have no importance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> He means if British devotees came to India, would they be asked to leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I mean to say... I am speaking of politics. Devotees are the same... Oh, British citizens...? They may...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You say the Americans might have to leave. What about the British?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they, generally, during wartime...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...they ask all foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> During the last war, the Christian Mission of Krishnanagar, they had many Italian priests also, but the government gave them permission to stay, although India was at war with Italians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the missionary consideration, they can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> What will be the position with the Chinese if the Russians and Americans fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well I am not a politician. (laughter) China does not war, not want war. They want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Construct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They're not ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are not very much interested in war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that this war will destroy the demonic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Does that mean that it'll destroy all the cities and all the industries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> War means destruction of all cities. That is natural. You have got experience in Europe so many times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cities and industries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Cities and industries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the main target.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Nobody's interested in a farm. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...endeavor, pure devotees are automatically expert in politics, economics, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Without separate endeavor, a pure devotee is automatically expert in everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Politics, economics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Sociology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam evaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavanti.</span> If you know Kṛṣṇa, then you understand everything. That is the Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte.</span> If you simply understand Kṛṣṇa... In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is also said that "There will be no more anything to understand." In the Ninth Chapter? What is that verse? Can anyone say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The Fifteenth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Avaśiṣyate. Jñātavyam avaśiṣyate.</span> You cannot...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Santoṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Yaj jñātvā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cannot recite, the whole verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Santoṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the second line. First line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Santoṣa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa evaṁ guhyatamaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vakṣyāmy...</span> Yes, that is the verse. <span class="Italic">Yaj jñātvā anyaj jñātavyam na avaśiṣyate.</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness is such a great science that if one becomes expert, then he knows everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So Prabhupāda, is there something we should do to prepare ourselves for this disaster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This coming war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should simply prepare for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That's all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, people sometimes argue that "God placed us in this world..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People argue that "God has placed us in this world, and that He's left us in darkness, so therefore He's played a trick on us." What is our argument against this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have come to this world of darkness, and Kṛṣṇa is trying to raise you again to the light. That is the fact. You have willingly come to this nonsense place. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He comes Himself and tries to again get you out, deliver from this nonsense thing. This is real position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> They say that "God has put us here, but He's given us intelligence, so we're to figure it out ourselves."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> That "God has put us here, and He's given us intelligence, so we're to figure it out ourselves."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore, you take intelligence from God, you rascal. Why do you keep yourself in darkness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Well, they say that "God has given us the intelligence to figure it out on our own."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence-you surrender. You are surrendering to <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> to your wife, to your dog, to your family, to your house, to your nation. Why not God? You rascal. You are surrendering to so many other things. Why not to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Just like you told that Russian professor that he is surrendering to Lenin, but we are surrendering to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But everyone has to surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Surrender, this, that is the only way. You cannot become independent. You have to surrender. Who is a man who has not surrendered? At least he finds out a dog and surrenders to him. (laughter) In your country there are so many people living with the dog. So surrender is the only business of you. <span class="Italic">Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya nitya kṛṣṇa dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> (pause) So Acyutānanda cannot come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viṣṇujana:</span> He's lecturing in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, someone asked a question the other day about the atom which I couldn't give the answer to. His question is that if we say that within the atom the living entity, the <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> is present, and life symptoms means six symptoms of birth, growth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Their life symptoms has not yet come. But there is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Potential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> His question was... It was sort of a dual question. At what time, or what...? Just like at the time of disintegration of this body, the living entity leaves this body and the body disintegrates, so does the atomic body also disintegrate when the living entity leaves it and moves to a higher body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atomic body? Atomic body means material body. Unless you are free from this material body, the atomic body will go on with you. That means unless you are <span class="Italic">mukta,</span> the atomic body will go on. Mind, intelligence, ego-they are also atomic, finer atomic body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But within each atom the living entity is present?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is present; therefore living entity is present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the living entity is present within the atom just as I am present within this body. When I leave this body, my body breaks apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you leave this body, enter another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By nature's law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And when I leave this body, the body breaks apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When I leave this body, the body dis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The body is already atomic combination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it remains atomic combination. You leave the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. It remains...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You leave the house. That does not mean the house is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right, I can understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He's asking that if the soul leaves the atomic particle, then does the particle break apart. Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You have not left atomic particle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but you, you're... I think you were saying that within the atom there's also a living entity. So when that living entity leaves the atomic particle does the particle break apart? Or doesn't it? I mean what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try to understand. From the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> you understand that <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stham:</span> "God lives within the atom."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when the God is there, living entity's also there. This... This much you try to understand. Because God and living entity, they remain together, as two friends. God is trying to save this fallen friend. That is the information from <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad.</span> So when God is there, the living entity is also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> So Paramātmā and <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> are always together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can we say that the living entity is present within the atom by consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No. Consciousness will gradually develop according to the bodily situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> How does the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> get out of the atom and take a gross body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> How will that <span class="Italic">jīva..."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Body is combination of atoms. How he gets out of the atom. Body is nothing but combination of many atoms. Everything material is combination of many atoms. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> The <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> inside the atom, are they like impersonalists who are in the Brahman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you consider. He has not developed his consciousness. Practically, it is like dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, if there was a war, a large-scale war, I think that our farming projects...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that the various farm projects that we have would be very good because, as you said, the cities would be bombed, but the farms would not be disturbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The farm project... Even some hundreds of years, it was so nice. Even there was war, they would not attack the farmers. Rather, they would ask, "Where the other party has gone?" So they will say: "Oh, we have seen some soldiers going this way." That's all. They were not affected. That was the principle. Farmers were not attacked, just like at the present moment, the law is the civilians are not attacked. The military target is attacked. That is the law. But they do all nonsense. Even at the present moment civilians are not attacked. Just like Kurukṣetra Battle. It was taken far away from the civilian inhabitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Some field.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is civilization. "Why these innocent civilians should be killed? Let us fight, military to military. That's all." That is honest fighting. We have to settle some things by fighting. So fighting may be, I mean to say, limited within the fighters, not with the civilians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> In modern warfare it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? Yes. But they, they are so rascals, they throw bomb anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially atom bomb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one thing is that because civilians are also responsible for declaring war, because the parliament is the representation of the people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, now the war is between people to people, nation to nation. They support with men and money. So therefore they are also killed by nature's law. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> you wrote that the Communist movement is greater than the capitalist movement because there are more <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> than <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> so that in a war between Communism and capitalism, the Communists would win.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naturally. They are in greater number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> But these modern wars are fought with missiles and bombs more than armies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Formerly, also, there were <span class="Italic">brahmāstra,</span> fire, firearms, <span class="Italic">brahmāstra.</span> [break] ...problems that we are facing, they were also in the past under different name, different form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> [break] ...Communists win, that will not stop our preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> They do not like to hear of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> You wrote that if the Communists are victorious they would destroy whatever is left of the culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Victory for the Communists means the whole human culture is lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ajāta-śatru:</span> Does it mean that they will also attack the Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have already begun. They are not passing our temple in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> If after the war the preaching will be still good, that means the Communists will not be victorious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> The Americans will win?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Honest people will take to religious way of life. The Communists becoming victorious means they are also ruined. Who is that saintly person, sitting under the tree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Tuṣṭa-kṛṣṇa Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...too much danger, you all come and sit down here. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Then men will be eager to come join our India project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can go to Africa also. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, anywhere we can go, so many places, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Hong Kong also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hong Kong? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhavānanda Mahārāja can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ajāta-śatru:</span> Means then some devotees has to stay in Europe or in America. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything you stay. We have got place like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Our farms are very nice because economically when everything is in chaos, we can still provide food for our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> And milk and butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Milk and butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Santoṣa:</span> In America, <span class="Italic">prabhu.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> ...that if there is a war between Russia and America, there would be a nuclear war and they would pollute the whole atmosphere with radioactive particles which would kill everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already polluted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> They say that this radioactive fall-out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole material world is polluted. Who will live here? A little, say, twenty years before, dying. After all, you have to die, twenty years after or twenty years before. So it is already polluted. That is humbugism. They will die at the end, but still they are trying to live. (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> in background growing progressively louder as Prabhupāda approaches temple)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like they're creating their own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the difference between man of knowledge and without knowledge. A man of knowledge will think, "After all, I have to die. So what is the difficulty, dying a few days more or before?" That is knowledge. And those who are not in knowledge, they are afraid of death. Best business is before the death comes let us finish our Kṛṣṇa consciousness perfectly. That is wanted. Death will come. You cannot avoid it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeṣvara:</span> They say that this radioactive fallout will pollute the air so that no crops can be grown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You shall die without food. Be(cause) after all, the death. In Bengal, it is called: <span class="Italic">more bhera ghalne</span> (?): "The most misfortunate thing is death." That will come. Therefore the best intelligence is how to avoid death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Become immortal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real intelligence, not to be bothered by these trifle temporary things that "I am dying twenty years before. If the situation was better, I would have lived more twenty years." What is this mentality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ajāta-śatru:</span> Yes, we can go back to Godhead. (Prabhupāda enters temple, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> very loud) (end)</div>
