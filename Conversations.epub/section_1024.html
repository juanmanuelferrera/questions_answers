<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am sitting in this room and if by force you drive me away, I shall go to another room. Because I'll have another room. But because you have forcibly driven me away you are criminal. Similarly, a living entity is ordained to live in a certain body for a certain period. If you kill, that is the interference with his staying there. You are criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, that is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The soul is never killed. Never killed. But because you have forcibly driven away from that body, you become criminal. That is the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. Now, assuming...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Assuming that, everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not assuming. This is the fact. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, assuming this end. I am putting a question. Every man who took part in the Kurukṣetra war, assuming that they are to be killed, they are destined to be killed. Then when they are killed, then Kṛṣṇa's argument is the soul, the body perishes but the soul is eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Soul is eternal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...the soul. How you are reconciling it if you say that the... I mean what a man is different from Kṛṣṇa. Or <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is different from Paramātmā. If you say that, then how do you say that <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is eternal? And what is the fate of the <span class="Italic">ātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is eternal. That is said, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> Why don't you understand? <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> is eternal, God is eternal. But the difference is, next line, <span class="Italic">eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That one <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> God, He is maintaining others, and the others are being maintained. So how you can make equal the maintainer and the maintained? First of all, try to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The question is, even if you take it, <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy also there is a, the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> has to go and merge with the Paramātmā, but they didn't say that they're equal. I don't think even the <span class="Italic">advaita</span> philosophy also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can be equal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They cannot be, cannot be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cannot be, yes. But they say equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No. They don't say that equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Devotee:</span> The Barishus(?) recently said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Don't take it from one sentence and try to enlarge it. Take it in the context.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Devotee:</span> They always say this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not hear. You hear, he hears. If he says something else... That... This is therefore Caitanya's philosophy is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> that as <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> they're equal. <span class="Italic">Ātmā.</span> But one is Paramātmā, because He is maintainer. Therefore...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. All the creation, the world. It is one way out of that Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paramātmā. So therefore Paramātmā is the Supreme, and he is subordinate. So how the Supreme and subordinate can be equal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, they can never be equal. Never be equal and never and... No philosophy, even any branch of philosophy does not say that a human being is equal to....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their philosophy is, as you say, that this subordinate <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> has forgotten that he is Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, it is a main point. The seeker has forgotten that he is the sought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> He has forgotten means simply the potential that you have within you, you have to realize it and come closer to the Paramātmā. That is what it means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got the potency to become Paramātmā, then how you became <span class="Italic">ātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The potential to come near to Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Near, that is one thing. You are near to me. That means we are not equal. You are a separate person, I am a separate person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But even what has been told by him, he is Veda, Vedāntī, anybody, he doesn't come to ātmā is going to Paramātmā. He never says that. That mathematic equation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They say that the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> has forgotten. They say that <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> has come into the clutches of the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> When you get rid of the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> you become Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is not... You don't become Paramātmā. You become Paramātmā means that... You don't understand Paramātmā. Paramātmā is the Supreme, Supreme soul. How can you become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have to accept Paramātmā and <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Different, that is true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then <span class="Italic">dvaita-vāda.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">advaita?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Even <span class="Italic">dvaita</span> does not, something different from <span class="Italic">advaitam.</span> In this particular fundamental. But even <span class="Italic">advaitam</span> does not say that <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is equal to Paramātmā. He never says that. You have <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> will be field to you and that you get rid of that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and you try to elevate your soul to the <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> And you come, go to the Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning of spiritual lesson. Because that is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Everyone of us, we are identifying with this body. Just like if somebody asks what you are, "I am Mr. such and such, I am Indian, I am this, I am that." He is giving identification of the body. But that he is not. He's not this body. That is self-realization. That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span>-two things-<span class="Italic">deha,</span> this body, and <span class="Italic">asmin dehe,</span> there is <span class="Italic">dehinaḥ,</span> the owner of the body. That is the beginning of spiritual education. Because generally almost 99.9% people, they are thinking that I am this body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Well, that is true, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That attachment to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That attachment or no attachment, he is different from the body. That is the first lesson of spiritual education, that one has to understand that he is not the body. That is Brahman realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, after having realized that, we have to (indistinct) ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now that individual soul and the Supreme Soul, Paramātmā, they are also different. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the Second Chapter Kṛṣṇa says, "My dear Arjuna, both you, Me, and all these persons who are assembled here, we existed in the past, and we are existing now, and we shall continue to exist." So when they become one? Past, present and future. As they were different persons in the past, they are different persons now and they will continue to remain different persons in the future. So when they become one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Now we take it, small particles of water makes an ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cannot be. Here Kṛṣṇa says that we shall remain like this in the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We can't get new to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no amalgamation. It is clearly stated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Even a drop of water, when you take it from the glass and put it on this one. Another drop of water will come and when you put it in medicine won't come in water. Like that, <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> will it not merge with the Paramātmā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That water is matter, that is not spirit. But we are talking of spirit. You cannot bring matter. No, that analogy cannot be, because similarity. The water is different, matter. And you are talking of spirit souls. Here it is stated that the spirit soul individually, they'll never amalgamate. <span class="Italic">Acchedyo 'yam.</span> They cannot be separated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then what is the aim of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> if you are not going to merge with Paramātmā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti...</span> You try... You read carefully. Because you do not read, therefore... <span class="Italic">Nitya-yuktā upāsate. Nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> When they come to the point of <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> there also the <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> is there. One <span class="Italic">nitya</span> is worshiping the other <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> That is <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Upāsana... Upāsana</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upāsana</span> means <span class="Italic">upāsaka, upāsana</span> and <span class="Italic">upāsita.</span> Three things. As soon as you bring <span class="Italic">upāsana,</span> there must be one person who is offering <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> and there is a process of <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> and the other person accepting <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Then we're assuming that we're, actually the idea of <span class="Italic">śuddha-bhakti</span> is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means that. <span class="Italic">Nitya-yuktā upāsana. Upāsana</span> continues. Here they're <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span> Here the devotees offering worship to the Deity, it is <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span> And after being perfect, that <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> will continue. It will never stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> It will never stop, that's the fact. That is that a man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Māyāvādī philosophy is that you offer <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> now and when you are perfect you become one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Not one. I mean you merge with one. Not you become one. You merge with one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no <span class="Italic">advaita-vāda.</span> There is <span class="Italic">dvaita-vāda.</span> Two. There is no <span class="Italic">advaita-vāda.</span> If you accept that you remain different, then there is no <span class="Italic">advaita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> We don't dare do you see, <span class="Italic">ācchā</span>, at a particular stage you like to merge with Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meeting, I am meeting you. That does not mean we have become one. You are meeting me, I am meeting you. So we are different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> What is ultimate object of that <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ultimate object is you are offering this flower-this is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> But you are different than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That's all right. That is all right. That <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> you can call it love, you can call it various things. <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> means the process by which Bhagavān and <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> interact. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That's all? He gains with that interaction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Interaction. That does not mean <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> and Bhagavān become equal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakta</span> and Bhagavān may not be equal, but even the <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> and we say the Bhagavān Himself declares that "My <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is more superior to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You say whatever you say, they remain two-different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They may remain two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is not <span class="Italic">advaita-vāda.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dvaita-vāda.</span> Two, two, not one. That is <span class="Italic">dvaita-vāda.</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You mean to say eternally there is a soul and... This <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and Paramātmā will remain separate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore the... Therefore it is said: <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> Therefore the word is there, <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā. Nitya</span> means everlasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Everlasting. You remain separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Separate. And that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ [Bg. </span>15.7<span class="Italic">].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many things. But here it is said <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> Even they come to the platform of <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> where there is no birth and death. That is <span class="Italic">nitya. Nityaḥ śāśvato 'yaṁ na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even that platform, Bhagavān remains different than the devotee who worships.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Eternally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eternally. That is <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> There is no oneness. Otherwise why it is <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate? Nityo nityānām.</span> The <span class="Italic">nityānām,</span> plural number, and <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> Bhagavān. So <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If you take the <span class="Italic">kevala-bhaktas,</span> if you take the life of a <span class="Italic">bhakta...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you take logic, it is stated there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If you take <span class="Italic">bhakta-vidyā</span> where so many sayings like Chakubhai and Namdev and all these people. If you take it... They had, they observed <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> from the beginning, that is, they considered Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have considered that the <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> is a means to become one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Means to become one. That's exactly what I mean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is their version. But that is not the version of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, it's the only way. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-mārga</span> is only <span class="Italic">mārga.</span> It is only way to become one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They never become one. Therefore <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then why should we say in our...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can say anything, but that is not accepted. We have to accept Kṛṣṇa's statement. You can say anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Sir, I am not saying. That is what I am taught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least, you are saying now. So, then which one you will take? As you are taught or as Kṛṣṇa said it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Merge with the Lord, Mirabhai, merge with the Lord, and Chakubhai, merge with the Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You bring thousands of examples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then what is that merging?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You bring thousands of examples, but whether we have to accept them or Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I mean the doubt I am having, <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you, you now you just become out of doubt. That... Just like Kṛṣṇa says in the Seventh Chapter, <span class="Italic">mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ asaṁśayam.</span> Here is <span class="Italic">asaṁśayam.</span> No doubt. Why you are in doubt? You do not accept Kṛṣṇa. You accept somebody else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Not a question of accepting. We are all ignorant people in the field of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are in doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> We are, we have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore you are in doubt. If you want to be doubtless, then you accept Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ. Āśrayaḥ.</span> Not that equal footing. <span class="Italic">Mad-āśrayaḥ. Asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu</span> [Bg. 7.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you have to accept Kṛṣṇa. If you become, if you want to become doubtless. Otherwise, you'll be put into doubt. Here it is said <span class="Italic">asaṁśayam,</span> "without any doubt." That is the process. And if you want to remain in doubt, you continue. You accept this man, that man, that man, that man, that man. That is your business. But if you want to be doubtless, then you have to accept Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So we say in the <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga</span> for eternally the Paramātmā and <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> will remain separate, separate entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is always. You cannot become one with Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then in what levels the man got to remain in a separate entity? Always in the same <span class="Italic">bhakta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> The one is worshipable, another is worshiper. That's all. <span class="Italic">Nitya-yuktā upāsate. Upāsate</span> means the worshipable is there and the worshiper is there. Then the question of <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span> If they become one then where is <span class="Italic">upāsana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, that's exactly what I'm telling. At one stage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not the fact. Here it is said <span class="Italic">upāsate. Upāsate</span> means he worships. So if he loses his existence, then where is worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No. <span class="Italic">Ātman's</span> got to go on practicing and try to become pure and purer and purer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without being pure you cannot go there. There is no question of <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Unless you are completely free from all sinful reaction, there is no <span class="Italic">upāsana.</span> That is practice. That is practice. Just like neophyte, one is practicing. Just like one student is practicing. That is <span class="Italic">sa bhakta prakṛta smṛta.(?)</span> This is material. But when you are <span class="Italic">pākā,</span> practiced, then you go to the <span class="Italic">nitya-dhāma.</span> And your business is the same. Here it is practice and there it is permanent. That's all. <span class="Italic">Nitya-yuktā upāsate.</span> The <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> continues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Then our object is to get rid of the birth. Birth and death. That we want to be eternal. From there you want to get rid of your birth and death. That is birth and death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birth and death you stop as soon as you give up this material body. Material body, the birth question comes of the material body. And death also material body. Therefore it is clearly said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, na jāyate na mriyate vā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, you are trying to do <span class="Italic">sādhanas</span> to see what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, understand this, that the soul is never born, never dies. But we are seeing birth and death. What is that birth and death? It is of the body. But you are different from the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, I am different. My soul is different, the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> different from the body. That is the conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birth and death applies to the body. Not to the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. That, your <span class="Italic">karmas,</span> you enjoy and suffer according to your <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is body, all body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is body. How long you are going to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long you are not a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I mean even if I am a devotee, I go on doing some sins...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You become devotee, then immediately transfer to the <span class="Italic">nitya-yuktā upāsate</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, I become a devotee, a true devotee...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you become a perfect devotee then you are transferred to the eternal world and your engagement is <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> eternally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The eternal world. What is that eternal world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do not know? You read, study? Have you studied <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Do you know that there is an eternal world? There is an eternal world? Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Our <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> say eternal world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Man is eternal world by going and enjoying there in <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span> there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span> When you go to the eternal world, that is <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span> That is <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Do you separate the eternal world from the Paramātmā? It is something, a world like our material world that we have got, physical world that we have got, is going to be out of, the eternal world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. <span class="Italic">Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> This word is used, <span class="Italic">sanātana. Sanātana</span> means eternal. There is another world. <span class="Italic">Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> Find out this verse. Everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We have to start packing up now. It's quarter past six. We have to leave in ten minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now we have to stop. We have to leave. You just refer that verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse"><span class="Italic">paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo<br class="calibre2"/>'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yaḥ sa sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/></span>naśyatsu na vinaśyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 8.20]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na vinaśyati.</span> The material world will be finished and that will remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> "Yet there is another nature which is eternal and is transcendental to this manifested and unmanifested matter. It is supreme and is never annihilated. When all in this world is annihilated, that part remains as it is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vāsughoṣa:</span> "Kṛṣṇa's superior spiritual energy is transcendental and eternal. It is beyond all the changes of material nature, which is manifest and annihilated during the days and nights of Brahmā. Kṛṣṇa's superior energy is completely opposite in quality to material nature. Superior and inferior nature are explained in the Seventh Chapter." And the next verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. There is an eternal world, <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span> That is never annihilated. So when you go to that <span class="Italic">sanātana-dhāma,</span> God is there, <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> and there you live eternally and go on rendering service to God. That is (indistinct). There is no question of oneness. The variety is there, but there the varieties are eternal, here the varieties are temporary. That is difference. Everything is there. So thank you very much.</div>
