<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Do you know this? [break] ...go somewhere, better go, at least four men; and when you read some knowledge, at least two men; but when you eat, one man. Don't bring four men and two men. Then he will be hungry; you will be hungry. (laughter) So for advancement of knowledge, two men at least required, discussion-not that I am reading and sleeping also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Just before coming here we were in Laguṇa Beach, and Guru-kṛpa Mahārāja, Yaśodānandana Mahārāja, Paramahaṁsa Mahārāja, Viṣṇujana Mahārāja and myself, we got your new books, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> So we were reading constantly from early in the morning. We found it was very enlivening, the fact that we were reading amongst a number of devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">iṣṭagoṣṭhī,</span> or discussion. Discussion does not take place alone. There must be at least two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Dvabhyanaṁ pathanaṁ pathī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dvabhyaṁ patanam.</span> (Hindi) ...instruction... (Hindi) Either you speak in Bengali or in Sanskrit. [break] Then that is an asset. One day they will come to help us. It is called <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛtī,</span> devotional advancement without knowledge. Even... [break] ...have appreciated. In Hyderabad, these Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> were challenged by the people, that "Bhaktivedanta Swami has gone to foreign countries, and he established so many Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa temple. What did you do? If you say that you disagree with Bhaktivedanta Swami-you worship demigods-so how many demigods' temple you have established?" They challenge like that. "If you say that you are worshiper of Lord Śiva, why don't you go and establish a Śiva temple? You are sitting idly here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> And Śiva always worshiped Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. That is another thing. They, "If you believe that Lord Śiva is the Supreme, why don't you go and establish? Why you are sitting here and declaring <span class="Italic">jagad-guru?"</span> Their purpose was that "Either you worship Śiva or Kṛṣṇa, it doesn't matter, but if you would have done something that would have spread the Hindu conception of... But you are not doing there anything. Why do you call yourself <span class="Italic">jagad-guru?</span>" (Hindi) "A jackal is the king in the forest." And they do not go outside. Even Gaṅgeśvarānanda went; he came back disappointed. What they will do? Cinmayananda goes so many times. What does he do? (Hindi) [break] He is so big. What does he have? What he has done? This thing going on. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> One has to be studied by the result, not by talking. It is not that Caitanya Mahāprabhu entrusted the subject of preaching only unto me. Why they do not go, the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs,</span> swamis, big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> and stalwart? Why they are rotting within this area?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They know only how to criticize for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the meaning of that criticize? First of all you come to the stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Enviousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, Bon Mahārāja, our Godbrother, went. What did he bring? He brought some HMD. HMD. You know HMD? You do not know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Hindustan Machine Tools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> When Bon Mahārāja came I asked him many things, many questions. He was praising, and he said that more than 50% people are liking our organization in U.S.A. Only due to that, their children got saved from intoxication. And they are happy that their lives are also... That's what he told me. I told him, "What is your impression about our organization?" Then he told me everything. He also told me that one or two places (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...official said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." When we went to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have been forced to forget Hare Kṛṣṇa by the so-called rascal leaders. Otherwise India is meant for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, the whole India. [break] ...scandalous these Māyāvādīs and next the politicians, killing the spirit of India. These Māyāvādīs teaching "Why you are after God? You are God." That's all. And he says, "Yes, I am God. Why shall I worship God?" This is the... And becoming God, when they do not get any relish of becoming God, then the politician says, "It is all useless. Come to the political field. Take <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-seva.</span> That's all, finished." The Māyāvādī creates the field of atheism, and later on, the politician make them perfect atheist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I am also building a small temple in my place here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">bharaṇena vā. Nidrāya hṛiyate naktaṁ vyāvayena ca vā vayaḥ [SB </span>2.1.3]<span class="Italic">. Vayaḥ</span> means age. They are wasting their, this human form of life, duration of life, at night either by sleeping or by sex. <span class="Italic">Nidrāya hṛiyate naktraṁ vyāvayena ca vā vayaḥ.</span> And in daytime... <span class="Italic">Divā cārthehaya rājan...</span> In daytime-"Where is money? Where is money? Where is money?" And when he gets money, how to spend it for <span class="Italic">kuṭumbha,</span> not for Kṛṣṇa. They get money sufficiently, and as soon as he is asked to spare some money for Kṛṣṇa, "No, the law is that I should give money to my sons. The law is." Even our devotees are saying like that. "The law is that I must give to my son, not to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Our devotees are saying that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (Hindi) "You just see my face, beautiful face. And whatever I had, that I have left with my sons and wife." Mostly they come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> And at the same time, they all are earning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is for their sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> They are earning themselves, their son, sufficiently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) ...in the <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> that those who have come to Vṛndāvana for sense gratification, their next birth is monkey and dog in Vṛndāvana; then, next birth, liberated. So they became angry. Vṛndāvana is not for sense gratification. Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura therefore says,</div>
<div class="Verse">rūpa raghunātha pade haibe ākuti<br class="calibre2"/>kabe hāma bujhabo se yugala pīriti</div>
<div class="After-Verse">The <span class="Italic">rasa-līlā</span> of Kṛṣṇa and Rādhārāṇī, a person like Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, "I could not understand it because I have not yet studied the instruction of Rūpa Gosvāmī and Raghunātha Gosvāmī, six Gosvāmīs. How can I understand?" So these people, they think by seeing <span class="Italic">rasa-līlā</span> by professional men they will understand the <span class="Italic">līlā</span> of Kṛṣṇa. Rūpa-Raghunātha instruction not cared for. But without going through the literature, <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,</span> nobody can understand what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Verse">rūpa raghunātha pade haibe ākuti<br class="calibre2"/>kabe hāma bujhabo se yugala pīriti</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(Hindi) ...Goddess Kali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda? You mention in your book that recently they have begun some demigod worship in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not recently. Since very long time. These <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Caste <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs.</span> But originally this was not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Originally there was Rūpa Gosvāmī. Now they are imitating. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (end)</div>
