<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That should be stressed. First business is the neighboring village people, they should come, chant and take <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> And gradually, when they become interested, then they come, live with us, work with us. In this way they should be induced, bare living and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> As in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then our movement is success. Our only motive is how people become interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We have no other motive. No economic problem... Economic problem is... What is economic problem? We produce our own food and cloth, barely, and spiritual life... On the farm it is easier. And if they are dispatched to the city for livelihood, there are big, big roads and big, big cars and big, big anxieties. Then wine, meat, and so on, so on..., suicide, their spiritual life finished. These rascals are protesting. They have no ideas of spiritual life. They think this is life, to be merry, enjoy and drink. "Eat. Drink. Be merry." How they are committing suicide, they do not know. Nature's law is very stringent. They are foolish rascal. There is no education for them. Still, if we try, many men will be saved. So write very elaborately how to do this. Increase. And in your country, we increase this farm project any unlimited number... So much land is lying vacant. We can utilize the wood for constructing residences. And as soon as the jungle is clear, we can utilize it for growing food and keeping cows, as exactly they are doing in New Vrindaban. The cows are very happy. In our original New Vrindaban... What you have named it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The original farm? I think they still call that New Vrindaban.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, New Vrindaban, whole thing. That is called Bahulaban or something like that? So the cows are free moving. They're very happy. You have seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The original farm I haven't seen for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Last time you were not... I had been there. The cows are moving freely. They're very friendly, even to the children, just like family members. Yes. Kṛṣṇa... You'll find in India one boy taking care of twenty-five cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> With just a stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, with a stick. (chuckles) They are so submissive. The cow is going this side, "Raa-raa!"-immediately. (Jagadīśa laughs) When in Bible they say, "The animal is given to the care of man," like that... There is. This is care of, not that "Because we care of, we shall kill them." What is this interpretation? How demonic this Western civilization. "Because Jesus Christ, the God, has given the animals to our care, therefore we shall kill and eat." Anyway, try to introduce a renovation of civilization. Therefore they are trying to oppose us. Now they are conscious about the movement, that "If it is allowed to increase, then our program will be finished. And young men are taking. They are not rejecting." That is their concern. They are concerned about their business and industry. If these young men are held up in plain living, then where their industry...? Industry means to exploit the work of others and give them one dollar and make profit ten dollars. This is industry, at the cost of others some capitalist gaining huge profit. This is industry. "And let them live in a hellish condition, go to hell. Never mind. You work in the factory, and we make profit." The Communist is trying to take over the industry and get the whole profit. (laughs) That's all. The condition remains the same-hellish. But... What is called...? Complacent, he's satisfied that "I am getting the profit." All foolish. The Iran is also imitating European method of exploiting. They're bringing men from village. In India also, British period, they used to, that, but Indian people are little clever. They would come from the village to the city alone, not with family. They earn money and send to the family. And whenever they like, they go away. They're not dependent. And if you bring family, you have to work. That system is still going on. The village men, they come but they do not bring their family. Family remains in the village. He earns, he lives some way or other and sends money there, and the wife who is intelligent. He (she) accumulates the money and when there is enough money he (she) purchases land, investment. So... In after few years, when they have got enough land, they do not come back. They produce their own necessities. Very nice. Hare Kṛṣṇa. As soon as they are self-sufficient from the land they no more work. That's a good idea. Remain in the village with family.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> So I'm enthusiastic to do this assignment with Caitya-guru. But one difficulty is the men that are behind in Taiwan and Hong Kong, there's only three men, or two men actually. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No local man is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Well, one local American, he's helping. But no Chinese. They're not interested. We tried to present a nice program. We did <span class="Italic">kīrtanas.</span> I'm a little disappointed, but... But still, this program can go on. We can sell books. But one thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, selling books is our propaganda. That is very good program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> One thing... As far as being... We're shorthanded because I'm going to be coming back to India. I was thinking that because you instructed Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Goswami to help me by sending two men... But actually he never really sent two men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is no men, how can he do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> But there's so many men now in New York. Now it's January. There's no more big book distribution, plus they're recruiting so many men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they are not? It is simply lack of management. If there is no sufficient work, some men can go. Write. He is also GBC. Men should be equally distributed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (offer obeisances) (end)</div>
