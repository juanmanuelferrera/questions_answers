<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> A philosophical society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Historic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Not historical, more philosophical. And he writes many papers for the Catholic Church, for the Vatican.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was also student of philosophy in 1916 to 20 under professor Dr. W.S. Urquhart in Calcutta, Scottish Churches' College. He was my professor. Later on, he became vice chancellor, very big philosopher. We read Dr. Stephens Metaphysics. What is your special subject for study?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, it's rather difficult to say. I suppose medieval philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Medieval.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> From a modern point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> From a modern point of view.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> I was not a specialist in medieval or anything. So it seems to me that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the conception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> They have some basic conceptions which are eternal in, the same way as your own, perhaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Vedic literature we have information, two eternals. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.</span> It is personally identified. "There is one chief eternal, and there are many other eternals." So then it means the chief eternal is God, and other subordinate eternals are living entities. Just like we are all living entities. We are in different forms, but we are eternal. The form is not eternal, but the owner of the form is eternal. And similarly, the chief eternal is God. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām<br class="calibre2"/>eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān<br class="calibre2"/> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">In this way. So the chief eternal is the maintainer of the many subordinate eternals. This is the idea of God and the living entities. So we are dependent eternals or the the predominated eternals. And there is another eternal, chief eternal, who is the maintainer of all these eternals and who is the predominator. We are predominated. This is the conception of Kṛṣṇa consciousness philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, may I ask a question? I find in medieval European philosophy two different attitudes and..., which I find difficult to reconcile perfectly. That is to say the earlier Christians, up to the thirteenth Century, I suppose, were practically only thinking about God, nothing else but God so that nature or the human being, or any... everything else, tended to disappear altogether as also in some Indian philosophy, I think. And then, later on, with more modern science and so on you've got a different attitude in the Christians themselves, that is to say an attitude of acceptance towards subordinate things so that they became independent and finally, of course, broke away altogether so that nowadays we have science without God at all. But there was a sort of period in the late middle ages when St. Thomas Aquinas, who stopped thinking about God, only about God, and gave his attention to science, so they say. Well, there was a sort of conflict there. I don't quite know what to say about it whether I'm on one side or the other. That is to say if I were to (indistinct) the earlier Christian or (indistinct) There was Aquinas, for instance, who was a saint, but he would pray into the world, if you like. I wondered whether you would disapprove of that or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, these different types of philosophers are always there, not only in the medieval age, in the previously also. It is said, <span class="Italic">na cāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.</span> "A philosopher is not a philosopher if he does not present a different view." (laughter) This is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Tarko 'pratiṣṭhaḥ śrutayo vibhinnaḥ</span> (?). <span class="Italic">Tarka,</span> by argument, logic, you cannot come to the right conclusion because you may be a good logician and then you meet another logician who is better than you. So his arguments may be stronger than your argument. Therefore, simply by arguments or logical premises, you cannot approach the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Oh, yes. I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And <span class="Italic">śrutayo vibhinnaḥ.</span> Literatures are also, authentic literatures... <span class="Italic">Śrutayaḥ</span> means authentic literature, which is acceptable. They are also various type. Just like <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> There are four <span class="Italic">Vedas: Sāma-Veda, Yajur-Veda, Atharva-Veda, Ṛg-Veda.</span> Then the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> are there. Then the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> is there. So if we study all this Vedic literature or any other similar literature, it is very difficult to find out the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Śrutayo vibhinnaḥ.</span> And if we take the philosophers, so one philosopher differs from another philosopher. <span class="Italic">Na cāsāv ṛṣir yasya mataṁ na bhinnam.</span> Therefore, to approach the Absolute Truth, God, is very difficult subject matter. Therefore our principle is <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">. Mahājana</span> means the recognized persons, recognized by the Supreme Lord, such persons we follow. We have got a list of recognized persons, just like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, the Manu. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Manu's name is there. <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam, vivasvān manave prāha</span> [Bg. 4.1], this Manu. So Manu, then Kapila, then Prahlāda, Janaka, Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Yamarāja. In this way there are twelve <span class="Italic">mahājanas.</span> And we receive knowledge from either of them. That is bona fide philosophy. That is called <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. The original teacher is Kṛṣṇa and from Him the sun-god, Vivasvān, learned it. He spoke to his son, Manu. Manu spoke to his son, Ikṣvāku. In this way the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system is coming. And that is bona fide. This is our philosophy, to accept knowledge from the perfect person or his bona fide representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> And Christians, how do you present this? Suppose if someone was a Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Christian, if you take... Just like Lord Jesus Christ is a bona fide teacher, and he has given his teaching, his commandments. If you follow those commandments, then you are bona fide student. But if you don't follow then you are not bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> And if you try to follow but fail or if you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you must follow. You cannot fail. Just like Lord Christ says, "Thou shall not kill." You must follow that. If you do not follow, then you are not Christian. It is not the question of that you could not follow or you are weak to follow. You must follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> But the Christians have a thing about forgiveness of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Within the Christian religion there is a strong emphasis on possible failure and forgiveness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Forgiveness is... I know that in church the confession program is there. Forgiveness... Suppose you are or I am an offender. I ask your forgiveness. So you can forgive me once, twice, thrice, not more than that. You cannot make it a profession that you go on committing sins and God will forgive you. No, that is not possible. That is misconception. That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">sudurācāraḥ,</span> means offender, that is not willful offense. One person is accustomed to some bad habits, but he has taken to Kṛṣṇa consciousness or God consciousness. But on account of strong habit, if he fails sometimes, that is excused, forgiveness, not that willful committing sin and ask for forgiveness. That is not allowed. In common affairs we do not see. I have got practical, I mean to say, experience. In my householder life I was proprietor of a big pharmacy. So my manager sold some morphia preparation to some unauthorized person. So the sales inspector, they noted it and made us a criminal. And the magistrate called me because I was the proprietor. So my statement was given that "I do not conduct the business directly. Of course, I am responsible for my manager's fault, but I shall be very strict in future. You can forgive me." Immediately I was forgiven. But next time, if I go, if I say like that, that is not forgiven. That is not possible. So this forgiveness is good for accidental fault. But it cannot be continued, that is a wrong philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Does that apply to all the rules of the Kṛṣṇa movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> For everyone. I mean rules about not drinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Would that be a sin in a non-Kṛṣṇa follower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is for everyone. When we speak something from the Vedic scripture, that is meant for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> I mean a Roman, perhaps, has never heard of Kṛṣṇa before. He breaks all your five rules, does he not, every day. Is that a sin in him? If he drinks wine...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He's saying, all the people in Rome who have never heard of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> They drink wine and do all the things which are... Well, perhaps not all, but anyway, some of them. Would that be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He's asking if they're very sinful if they don't have any knowledge of Kṛṣṇa or any of the rules of our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa... Ignorance is no excuse. If there is law and if you do not know the law, and you commit offense, that is no excuse, that you do not know the law. Similarly, human life is meant for understanding God. That is the main business of human life. If one does not know this law, then he is sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes, but the difficulty is for me, for instance, that I have the pope here who is telling me perhaps the same thing in spirit but with different rules, different laws practically. I mean the spirit seems to me to be the same, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Law cannot be different, but it can be modified according to the time and circumstances. But the law cannot be different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Maybe you could ask specific examples of differences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, for Roman Catholics it is right to drink wine, for instance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Drinking, intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Not intoxication, to drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> What is wine? He's saying that a Roman Catholic can take wine. The law allows them to take wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Or tobacco or meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Or tobacco or meat. So the rules are different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then rules are not different, but we have to see. Just like your commandments. In the commandments there is "Thou shall not kill." Then how you can eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, that is a possible argument, but I'm thinking about even lesser things such as wine or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Wine. Can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> And no Roman Catholic will admit that it is wrong to drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wine is sanctioned?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> I don't mean to get drunk. I mean to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Wine, for today's Roman Catholics, they think it is sanctioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think so many other things also. Just like Roman Catholics, there is example: they have allowed marriage between man to man. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In New York there is a paper, Watchtower. They publish a monthly magazine. I have seen in that magazine. They are condemning that the priests have allowed marriage, man to man. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> In New York maybe. Not in Rome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christianity does not mean in New York it should be different and Rome it should be different. Then nobody is following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Could it be, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that this sanction of wine drinking be from God? Could that sanction come from God? Do we think that is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't find there is sanction by God to drink. But under certain circumstances, beverages, different types of beverages allowed, not for intoxication but for keeping health. That is different thing. Just like in the moon planet, it is mentioned they drink <span class="Italic">soma-rasa. Soma-rasa</span> is a kind of beverage made from extract of herbs. So because it is very cold there, so they drink that, but not for intoxication. People drink for intoxication. Just like in medicine, so many drugs are used. Even opium is used. Yes. Morphia is used. But they are not used ordinarily. For a specific purpose. Even snake poison is used, but that does not mean snake poison should be used perpetually. So for benefit of the body under particular circumstances something may be recommended, but that is not for general use or for intoxication. That is condemned. Just like animal killing is sometimes prescribed in the <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> The purpose is different. But that does not mean unrestricted animal killing in the slaughterhouse should go on, no. That is sinful. So if we violate the laws perpetually, then how we can consider as belonging to a certain group of religious system? There must be principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well. I understand. But I only think that the dietetic rules would be perhaps an obstacle to the spreading... I mean certain rules which are clean against European or American custom might constitute an obstacle to the spreading of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. I mean, in the Roman Catholic church you have the monks. Then you have the laity who observe less strict rules without being considered outside God. And you don't have that, do you? I mean, the Kṛṣṇa movement is a movement of what we should call monks or religious... There is no laity in the Roman Catholic Christian sense, people of the world who are doing messy things, I mean, trading the drugs or whatever it is because it's a job they have to do, but belong to the church without being strictly religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least the church people, the priests, they must follow strictly the rules.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes. But I mean the difference seems to be with the Christian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Common man may not follow or cannot, but those who are teachers or the priest or the leaders or the executive head, they must follow. Otherwise they cannot remain pure and they cannot take the position of teacher or head. Head must be clean. Other parts may be unclean, but the head must be clean; otherwise the whole business will be spoiled. Therefore, the strictures, rules and regulation, must be followed by four persons. One person is the executive head like the president or the king. And the other person is the religious preacher, priest. And the other person is the public leader. So at least these three, four heads of the men's human society, they must be of ideal character. Otherwise the whole society will be spoiled. People will follow the heads.</div>
<div class="Verse">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas<br class="calibre2"/>tat tad evetaro janaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sa yat pramāṇaṁ kurute<br class="calibre2"/>lokas tad anuvartate<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Just like in America, the president Nixon is charged with so many offenses. So... This is not good. He is the head of the state, and he has been charged with so many pollutions. Then how people will follow exemplary character?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, I don't know whether these accusations have been proved in regards to Nixon. They may be true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I think they have. What are the charges against Nixon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Certainly he already... It all depends on the standards that we want to have for a president. In other words, he has not been convicted, but he has accepted, himself, certain charges, that he has lied and he has tried to save his men, and therefore he has lied, and he has evaded taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, I don't know about that, you see. I'm only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there have been so many charges against president Nixon. So no, whatever it may be, we are not concerned. But this is the Vedic principle, that the king or the executive head of the state, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and the public leader must be very clean. Otherwise society will be spoiled. That is the injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes, well, of course, I agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the present moment there is all over the world... We are touring all over the world. It is very hard to find out ideal class of men. That is the defect. In the Vedic culture the ideal class of men were the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Their qualification was: truthful, self-controlled, mind and the senses, and then tolerant, very simple life, full of knowledge, practical application of knowledge in life and full faith in God. These are ideal character. But such men are not available at the present moment. So therefore the social idealism is defective. Just like in your body, there are four divisions. The head, the arm, the belly and the leg. If the head is spoiled then you are a madman. In spite of possessing hands and bellies and legs, you cannot work properly. So at the present moment the heads are spoiled. Therefore the whole world is in chaotic condition. People, advanced in education, still they are inimical, one man to another. If you are passing on in the street, the gentleman's house there is a signboard, "Beware of the dogs. Don't come in," because he cannot believe anyone. You go to the airport, any high-class standard man. They search out the pocket. So nobody is believable. So this is the result of modern education. You cannot find out an ideal character man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Is this due to machines, do you think, to the prevalence of machines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is due to third-class, fourth-class men. There is no first-class men. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are considered to be first-class men, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> are considered to be second-class men, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are third-class men, and rest, all fourth-class and fifth-class. So at the present moment there is third-class, some, and all fourth-class and fifth-class. There is no first-class and second-class men. So unless they are, at least some of them are first-class men, ideal, the human society is doomed. It cannot be peaceful. Full of <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> fourth-class men. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is meant for creating some first-class men. This is our ideal. Therefore we forbid them not to take meat, not to have illicit sex, not to..., because these things are accepted by the fourth-class, fifth-class men: unrestricted sex life, meat-eating, intoxication, gambling. They are not to be indulged by the first-class, second-class men, even third-class. It begins from the fourth-class men. Fourth-class, fifth-class. So if one remains to the category of the fourth-class, fifth-class man, how he can be trained up as first-class man? Therefore these things are prohibited because our aim is to create some first-class men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, I agree with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These boys, although they are young men, they will never go to cinema. They are young men. They have got all propensities. But they are so elevated, they have given up all these low propensities, going to the club, restaurant, and cinema or naked dance and this and that, no. Because they are first-class men, they cannot indulge in the third-class, fourth-class proclivities. We are training them in that way. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, yes, you said restaurants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Is it that it depends on the restaurant or is that necessarily bad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, our principle is that we can eat only what is offered to God. So we cannot eat things in the restaurant because it is not offered to God. We may prepare nice things for Kṛṣṇa and offer to Him. Then we take. This is our principle. <span class="Italic">Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ. Yajña. Yajña</span> means worshiping the Lord. So worship the Lord, it is not difficult. Everyone is cooking for eating, every home. So cook certain things which is acceptable to Kṛṣṇa. Then offer to Him and take the <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> There is no difficulty. But you become purified. <span class="Italic">Yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ.</span> Because willfully or not willingly, we are committing so many sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes, I appreciate that very much. I only say is it not possible for things to be dedicated to God without actually being placed on the altar in that way? I mean what people may be doing that in different ways maybe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, thing is, if you want to offer to God, then-God is all-pure-the things you offer, that must be pure. And you must follow the instruction of God. Suppose if you want to give me something eatable, as a matter of etiquette, you ask me, "What can I offer you?" And if I say that "You offer me this thing, and that is very nice," you cannot offer me according to your whims. That may not be acceptable by Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes, I was thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, your dedication, must be with the sanction of God. If you dedicate something which is not sanctioned by God, then that offering is not pleasing. Suppose I have got a certain taste. If you ask me, "What kind of food I shall prepare for you..." In India, still the system is that the housewife asks the husband, the head of the family, "What you want to eat?" [break] ...offer something to God, you must take sanction from the God if He wants to eat that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Oh, well I was thinking of things like work, the work which people do, with that offered to God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> The work...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the service also, you must take sanction. Anything you want to do you must take sanction from the Lord. You cannot do anything whimsically and you think that "I am rendering service to the Lord."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Oh, yes, but then the sanction, would that apply to scientific activities like engineering, one of the factories of producing (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Would God sanction activities in the factory, technological, scientific world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no sanction. These are all sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> These are material activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have created all these things. God has not sanctioned. God has not sanctioned for running on a factory. Therefore as soon as you run on a factory, you simply commit sinful activities. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we don't find any such sanction that you run on a factory, a slaughterhouse or the brothel and this business and brewery no such sanction. But you have done at your whims. Just like in the last war, Mr. Churchill sanctioned or requested everyone to go to the church. What is that "V"? Victory? Yes. And now... Before starting the war, Mr. Churchill and company did not take any sanction. And when they were in reverse condition, then, that time, they are going to the church for victory. So God cannot be made in such a way as order supplier. That is not possible. This is not prayer. You start war whimsically, and when you are in a precarious condition you go to the church and pray God, "Give us victory." What is this? This is commanding God. But you have to follow the commands of God. That is your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Lord Chamberlain tried to stop the war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, Chamberlain may tried, might have tried to stop the war, but he could not stop the cause of the war. So far we know that the two wars started by Germany on account of Britain. So far I have studied. The German people did not like the Britishers to occupy the trade all over the world. And wherever they went to trade, they were restricting. I know this fact. In India the Britishers monopolized all trade, and they would not allow German goods to come in. So that was the cause of the war. The German knew that the Britishers, they are purchasing from Germany and stamping it "Made in London" and selling in India at high price. And when the Germans go there, they are not allowed to enter. This is the cause of the war. The Germans still, they do not like to speak in English. They are so envious. So Chamberlain might have tried to stop war, but his nation created the cause of the war. Why there should be... That was the demand, that free trade. Germans, in the, what is called, peace negotiation, their demand was free trade. Everyone... And that is very good. Why trade should be... This is unnatural. Let there be free trade. General public, they want best thing at good price, at cheap price. So if Japan and Germany can supply goods, necessary goods, at cheaper price, why they should be restricted? Let the people take advantage of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, I don't think they are restricted now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is going on. In India I know. They are selling sugar at two annas, four annas a pound, or seer, outside, and India, it is four rupees. What is this nonsense? This is going on. They want to import some war materials or something else, therefore they want export exchange. So they are sacrificing the convenience of the local people for export exchange. These things are going on. These politicians, they create an atmo... Therefore I say the head of the state, they must be clean. But they are all motivated. Therefore the whole world is in chaotic condition. Generally politician has got a particular motive behind him. And when he cannot pull on they declare war. That Pakistan. Pakistan, since the beginning of Pakistan they could not make any economic condition very sound. But when the people are too much agitated, they declare war with India. The whole attention is... And they have been educated in such a way that India is their strongest enemy. Anything Indian, they dislike in Pakistan. So this is going on by the politicians. They are creating situation because they are not honest, they are not clean. And a clean man cannot become politician. Mr. Lloyd George said that "consistency by the politician is the qualification of an ass." There cannot be any consistency amongst the politicians. So that is the defect, that the politicians are the heads, the leaders of the society, and they are in disagreement. Everyone has got his own ideal, and the fight is going on, and the poor man in the state, they are suffering. Just like in India they partitioned, Pakistan and Hindustan. It was arranged by the leaders, Jinnah and Jawaharlal Nehru. Especially Jinnah. The people are suffering. And the Britishers made partition in such a way that they will remain continually in war because everyone wants the necessities of life. The foodstuff is in Pakistan, and the industry is in India. So the Pakistan will suffer for want of industry, and India will suffer for want of food. This is British plan for partition. They had no business to divide the country, but they wanted to do it as a parting kick, that "You want independence. You will have independence, but you will remain perpetually in war." That was British policy. None of them are benefiting. Occasionally they are fighting and losing so much money and men, that's all, a political game. Similarly, Germany is divided. Ireland is divided. This is going on. People are fighting, fighting, fighting. Leaders should be so sober and honest that the people should live peacefully, without any anxiety, without any want. That is the duty of the leaders to see. Perpetually they are in want, in scarcity, not in peace of mind, full of anxieties. In India especially, we see, the economy is so unsteady. The money value is decreasing every day. Nobody knows what will be tomorrow. Rice is selling today at two rupees kilo, tomorrow, three rupees, next day, four rupees. Where is the income is coming? Therefore there is strike, railway strike. So this is the mismanagement. They cannot guarantee. At least in England I have seen that... Or why the England? In America also, the people are happy in this: they have got enough foodstuff, no scarcity. You see? India is in always scarcity. Goods are there. It is hoarded by somebody else. He will not let loose. He will not... Many goods are there, sufficient. The government stock. The government stock because the black marketeer, they have got some arrangement. So many things are going I don't wish to discuss. It is due to unclean politicians, unclean head of the department. Things are so mismanaged, and people are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> I was reading in the newspaper that a few days ago India exploded a nuclear bomb, an atomic bomb, underground. This was the first step. And they have declared that this was used for peaceful reasons, in order to develop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was a cartoon. When I... One leader is approached for food, that "We are in scarcity of food." The leader says, "Of course, it is very difficult to assure you for food grains. But from next week you will have television." (laughter) Next week you will have television. So these improvements are going on, television, but they are starving. This is going on. Advancement of knowledge and learning is going on in discovering television, but there is no food. This is the mismanagement of the leaders. Dishonest. There is enough food. Punjab still produces food grains. Bengal still produces rice, but they are stocked by government men, and they are mishandling. They are lying on the station for dispatch, but they will not be dispatched. They are rotting. Rainy season spoiled the whole stock; still, they are not dispatched. Official: "There is no dispatch order. There is no wagons available." Simply mismanagement or bribe. This is going on. And people are suffering. How it is possible to purchase? Suppose India's income, the average income, is very poor. Suppose one man earns ten rupees a day, and if he has to purchase ten rupees simply rice for the family, ten..., what for others? Then he becomes dishonest. He wants to earn money by taking bribe in his own capacity. So bribing has become a custom. Anywhere you go, unless you bribe, you cannot get release. And they say that "Whatever salary we are getting, that is not sufficient. Our extra earning is by taking bribe." And now in the Western countries also the difficulty is arising. I do not know whether you are already, I mean to say, aware that so many boys, they are becoming hippies. They are reluctant to do anything. That is a very dangerous sign. If you... If unemployment, no engagement, that is not good for the country. Everyone should be employed. Everyone should be engaged in some service. That should be the policy of the government. And everyone should be happy, without any anxiety. That is good government. So many people unemployed, doing nothing, producing nothing. Is it not a problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Absolutely. It's the same everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Except Germany, I suppose. I suppose everybody works in Germany still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there are so many problems. On the whole, the material world is full of problems. That is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by the Supreme Being, Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> "It is a place of miseries." You cannot make things very rightly going on. It is not possible. Therefore the best purpose will be served-leave this place, material world, and go to the spiritual world. That is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are advising people to become Kṛṣṇa conscious, and that way, he will be able to leave this place of miseries and enter the eternal life in the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. </span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is our... We don't try to adjust things here; it is not possible. It is not possible. However big philosopher I may be-I may give my ideas-it will never be possible to make here things peaceful. No, that is not possible. Just like if you want to make the lavatory very scientifically..., it is, after all, lavatory. Every minute it is becoming contaminated. So similarly, this world is so contaminated that you cannot make it completely free from contamination. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is a place of miseries. And actually it is the fact. Now we are trying to get out of miseries, is it not? The civic activities means to get out of miseries. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Atreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole attempt is to be out of miserable condition. Just like medicine. What is the medicine? Medicine means an attempt to get out of the miserable condition of disease. But you cannot stop disease. You may discover very improved method of medical treatment, but you cannot stop disease. That is not possible. You can, I mean to say, discover many means to stop death-that is going on-but you cannot stop death. That is not possible. So in this way... And the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says that you might be very advanced in civilization and scientific knowledge to make improvement, the condition of life, but you cannot make solution of these things, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> Birth, death, old age and disease, you cannot counteract these things. Still you have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Do you think it's worse now than it used to be? Can you say that it is worse, the condition of the world is worse now than it used to be or is it relatively the same or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, yes. Worse now in these days because people cannot eat even. The facility which is given to the birds and beasts... They have no problem of eating. But you have created such a civilization that people are facing the problem so acutely that they have no means to eat. Do you think it is progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Well, I would tend to doubt it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> But some things have improved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many countries... Especially we are Indian. We have seen in India. Nowadays there is no eatables. The government cannot supply food, failure, the problem which is not even amongst the beasts and birds. The birds and beasts, they have no such problem. They are freely living, jumping from one tree to another, because they know there is no problem of eating. And human society, there is problem of eating. What is the advancement? And there is enough place for producing food. I have seen Africa, Australia. Enough place. If the foodstuff is produced there, ten times of the population can be well fed. But they are: "Don't enter. Don't come here." The Africans will say to the Indians, "Don't come here. Go out." What is this? Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. We say, "Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. We are all sons of Kṛṣṇa. Let us live peacefully and utilize Kṛṣṇa's property." This is the best philosophy. But the so-called politicians and leaders, they are saying "No, you cannot enter here," immigration. America has got enough place to produce food. But they will, although they have gone to the United Nation, UNESCO, they could not find out any solution. Although there is possibility of producing ten times of the requisites of the whole population of the world, they will not allow. They will not allow. On God's side, this unit, this planet, <span class="Italic">pūrṇam idaṁ pūrṇam adaḥ pūrṇāt pūrṇam udacyate [Īśopaniṣad,</span> Invocation]<span class="Italic">-</span>everything is complete. You require water. They save three times water than the land. And the water is distributed over the land, <span class="Italic">parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ</span> so there will be sufficient food grains. And <span class="Italic">annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if there is sufficient to eat, have sufficient eatables to the animals and to the men, then everything is prosperous. So where is that arrangement? There is enough land, enough possibility, enough water. Now utilize them and produce food grain, eat nicely and live peacefully and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and go back to home, back to Godhead. This is our philosophy. Why there should be industry? You want to eat after all. Instead of eating this flesh, killing poor animals, why don't you produce food grains, fruits, flowers, food grain, and take milk from the animals and produce milk products, all nutritious food, all nice food, and be happy and remember God for His kindness. This is civilization. What is this nonsense civilization? Now there is petrol problem. I see so many buses, and not a single man, one or two men. And for two men a big huge bus is being run, and so much petrol is consumed unnecessarily. I have seen. I went from Nairobi to London in a plane-only five passengers. Out of that, four passengers we were. Why? Why this nonsense? And there is petrol problem now. They are creating simply, the so-called advancement of civilization, creating problems, that's all. And that is due to these rascal leaders. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know what is the ideal of life, what is the aim of life. They are creating hodge-podge civilization and putting the mass of people in chaotic condition. This is the sum and substance. I do not know whether you'll agreed with me, but this is my study of the whole situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Richard Webster:</span> Yes, well, I can't disagree with that.</div>

<div class="Normal-Level">Translation: The material miseries of the living entity, which are superfluous to him, can be directly mitigated by the linking process of devotional service. But the mass of people do not know this, and therefore the learned Vyāsadeva compiled this Vedic literature, which is in relation to the Supreme Truth.</div>
<div class="calibre8"><div class="Normal-Level">Purport: Śrīla Vyāsadeva saw the all-perfect Personality of Godhead. This statement suggests that the complete unit of the Personality of Godhead includes His parts and parcels also. He saw, therefore, His different energies, namely the internal energy, the marginal energy and the external energy. He also saw His different plenary portions and parts of the plenary portions, namely His different incarnations also, and he specifically observed the unwanted miseries of the conditioned souls, who are bewildered by the external energy. And at last he saw the remedial measure for the conditioned souls, namely, the process of devotional service. It is a great transcendental science and begins with the process of hearing and chanting the name, fame, glory, etc., of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Revival of the dormant affection or love of Godhead does not depend on the mechanical system of hearing and chanting, but it solely and wholly depends on the causeless mercy of the Lord. When the Lord is fully satisfied with the sincere efforts of the devotee, He may endow him with His loving transcendental service. But even with the prescribed forms of hearing and chanting, there is at once mitigation of the superfluous and unwanted miseries of material existence. Such mitigation of material affection does not wait for development of transcendental knowledge. Rather, knowledge is dependent on devotional service for the ultimate realization of the Supreme Truth.</div>
</div><div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> What was that last sentence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Africa and Australia, they are killing the animals and exporting. So in other countries they are getting meat to eat, and so they are very free to produce bolts and nuts by industry. They don't require to produce food because from Africa and Australia they are getting meat. This is going on. Instead of producing food, people are interested in producing motor car bolts and nuts. So why there should not be food scarcity? After all, you require to eat. But instead of starting industries, why don't you produce foodstuff? What is this civilization? Produce foodstuff. The animals will be nicely fed, and the men will be nicely fed.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> During your conversation with this gentleman, you mentioned that there was nowhere any sanction by God for industry or business. So does that mean that these workers in factories and industries, to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness they could not go on with their work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our recommendation is that whatever position you are, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So even the workers in the factory, they can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. What is the difficulty? Even in factory, they take some leisure hours. So why not sit down for five minutes, ten minutes, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? Where is the difficulty? Apart from the work they are doing, we are recommending, "Whatever is done is done. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will be all right." Where is the wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> But eventually it's understood they must stop their industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of stopping. If that is their livelihood, how they can stop it? That is not possible. But they can add this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> chanting. Then things will be adjusted. It is not possible to stop different methods of livelihood. That is not possible. If one can stop, it is well and good, but even he does not stop, he can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
