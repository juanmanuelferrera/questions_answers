<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na taj janeṣu abhijñeṣu. Abhijñaḥ janeṣu,</span> no attachment. Vyāsadeva, Śukadeva Gosvāmī, Nārada Muni, all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, they have no respect for these. They're creating their howling habits, that's all. How there can be peace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Now when the Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantras...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you say Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">panthā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> No, <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> I have come to <span class="Italic">mantra. Klīṁ kṛṣṇāya govindāya gopījanavallabhāya namaḥ.</span> Is that not a very powerful Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That is better than Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Hare Kṛṣṇa is therefore called <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> This you regard as the, higher than any other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But I was told that the <span class="Italic">Sudarśana-cakra</span> words, <span class="Italic">mahamala parakramāyā maha patanivaya bhakta jane kalpanaya,(?)</span> that is a very powerful <span class="Italic">mantra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything in relationship with God is powerful. But the name in this age is the most powerful. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> And the word <span class="Italic">om</span> has been praised in the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Om, veda, praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Praṇava</span> is <span class="Italic">oṁkāra. Sarva-vedeṣu,</span> "That <span class="Italic">praṇava</span> I am." That is sound representation of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Then that one word as a <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> is it not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> ...the highest sort of word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you keep Kṛṣṇa, that "This <span class="Italic">praṇava</span> is the sound representation of Kṛṣṇa," then it is all right. If you think it is separately powerful than Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">nāma-aparādha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you accept it as Kṛṣṇa says, that "I am <span class="Italic">praṇava,</span>" if you do remember Kṛṣṇa by chanting <span class="Italic">oṁkāra,</span> then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Otherwise, <span class="Italic">om</span> is only given to <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily. It is not mentioned there. Anyone chanting Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he has to begin with <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> All <span class="Italic">mantras</span> begin with <span class="Italic">om.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span> So <span class="Italic">sarva-vedeṣu. Praṇavaḥ sarva-vedeṣu.</span> This is beginning. Just like we take <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Doctor:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">etad akṣaraṁ brahma<br class="calibre2"/>etad akṣaraṁ param<br class="calibre2"/>etad akṣaraṁ jñātvā<br class="calibre2"/>yati ceti...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty is that we consider Kṛṣṇa is different from <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That is a mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But then Kṛṣṇa is not different from Brahman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you take this <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> as Kṛṣṇa's sound representation, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Then it is as good as chanting Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But it does not give...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because Kṛṣṇa is remembered, if you take <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> as Kṛṣṇa's sound representation then Kṛṣṇa is remembered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But Kṛṣṇa is three letters. <span class="Italic">Om</span> is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> In the last minute when you are dying you can feel it, easily feel it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa has many names. Kṛṣṇa has name Govinda. It is not three letters. It is more than that. Kṛṣṇa has so many thousands names. <span class="Italic">Advaitam acyutam anādim ananta.</span> So therefore Kṛṣṇa advises for the beginners, "Just try to remember Me in this way-<span class="Italic">raso 'ham apsu kaunteya [Bg. </span>7.8]-I am the taste of the water." The water you must be drinking twice, thrice, four times. So when you drink water, the taste satisfies your thirst. So if you simply remember, "This taste is Kṛṣṇa," that is Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> When you eat food, that also, the taste is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, especially of the water. Kṛṣṇa is everything, but specifically he mentions, "The taste of the water I am." So you remember this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That's very interesting. So every time you drink water...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can remember Kṛṣṇa. What is the wrong and what is the loss there? But you follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction. Yes, sit down. There is no difficulty to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. (microphone moves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Why do you tape record?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything Prabhupāda speaks we tape record and then everyone in the world can listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Someone said that the word <span class="Italic">om</span> is given to <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa does not say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> It's not so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Someone," we don't take authority. "Someone." There are so many "someones." We don't care for them. What Kṛṣṇa says we accept. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But this <span class="Italic">Kaṭha-Upaniṣad</span> praises <span class="Italic">om.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">etad ālambanaṁ śreṣṭhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>etad ālambanaṁ param<br class="calibre2"/>etad ālambanaṁ jñātvā<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-loke mahīyate</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> is giving lesson, counter part of this material world. Because... Just like you are stressing on <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> because you do not give much importance to Kṛṣṇa. In the material world, Kṛṣṇa, they think Kṛṣṇa is one of the historical persons. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> is teaching us in an indirect way about the importance of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Upa-niṣat.</span> To bring you nearby. Because you have got so many material conceptions, if we say that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead," you may not like it. Therefore... <span class="Italic">Oṁkāra</span> is Kṛṣṇa. So you are giving lesson on <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span> Although Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is not different, but you'll not like Kṛṣṇa. In your present position you'll not like Kṛṣṇa's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore you are stressing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> No, I have read all this and I am trying to reconcile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is for the neophytes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> The reconciliation is there. <span class="Italic">Om</span> is Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">om.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if Kṛṣṇa is... If you are convinced, then where is the objection of Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should you bring so many objections?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Ete cāṁśa-kalāḥ puṁsaḥ kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam</span> [SB 1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But because I do not like, therefore <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> give another chance, that "Chant <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span>" That is the way. Because unless one is completely purified, he cannot understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> is possible when one is completely free from all kinds of sinful activities. So not every one is freed from sinful activities. Therefore the indirect way. Otherwise, <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> is <span class="Italic">Veda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Based on <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Based. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> By studying <span class="Italic">Vedas, Upaniṣads,</span> if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, that means your study is not complete. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> After studying this indirect information of Kṛṣṇa, when one is actually a learned, wise man, he surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is very rarely found. This is fact. So if one is intelligent, that if only the most intelligent person, after many, many births one has to surrender to Kṛṣṇa, why not do it immediately? Why shall I wait for many, many births? That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrī-kṛṣṇas tu śaraṇaṁ mama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is intelligence. But that intelligence is not possible for ordinary persons. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> One who gets this intelligence, such kind of <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> is very, very rarely found. To take it immediately, ah, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">. Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">It is not so easy to understand Kṛṣṇa or to accept Kṛṣṇa as all in all. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam.</span> But if you take it, you are fortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> And the only way to attain is reciting the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Do that. Therefore the temple is there. Everyone may come and see Kṛṣṇa and think of Him. What is the difficulty? But he'll not come. He has concluded Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span> God is <span class="Italic">nirākāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Then Kṛṣṇa will not come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well now, Kṛṣṇa... You... Whatever you think, that is your business, but Kṛṣṇa is there everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> He is <span class="Italic">nirākāra</span> and <span class="Italic">sākāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirākāra</span> means He has no material <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">nirākāra. Ākāra</span> means we have got... Just like I have conception of you. So this <span class="Italic">ākāra</span> is your material <span class="Italic">ākāra.</span> It is not your real <span class="Italic">ākāra. Dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> The real person is within the body, but we have no connection with the real body. We see this outward... Just like seeing his dress, his... That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> How to find the...? How to get to the <span class="Italic">ātman,</span> the inner body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the first instruction in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that first of all, try to understand what is the person. So because we have no eyes to see, indirectly <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāram... [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]. Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">. Antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ [Bg. </span>2.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> So many things. <span class="Italic">Nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ.</span> So many indirect way because we cannot directly perceive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Nainaṁ chindanti śastrāṇi nainaṁ dahati pāvakaḥ</span> [Bg. 2.23]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called? Definition by negation. <span class="Italic">Nainaṁ chindanti-</span>negation. So that you can have some idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Of what it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not material. Because matter, <span class="Italic">chindanti,</span> any matter it can be destroyed. It can be cut into pieces, it can be melted in fire, it can be moistened. So when we cannot understand things, it is given in the definition of negation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But then it's much better to worship God in form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is intelligence. If you accept Kṛṣṇa immediately, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad...,</span> then your life is successful. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru, mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">, </span>He said. But they are not interested. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>9.11<span class="Italic">].</span> "Ah, Kṛṣṇa is a historical person. Why shall I think of Him? I shall think of <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span>" You cannot think of <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span> You can hear. And as soon as you think of <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> it comes from? There is no impersonalism. It again becomes personal. So they want to avoid personality and as well as think of Him-it becomes a very troublesome job. <span class="Italic">Kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktāsakta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 12.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> They cannot think of <span class="Italic">avyakta,</span> impersonal. But they are trying to think of. That is a very troublesome job. <span class="Italic">Kleśala eva avaśiṣyate.(?)</span> Such attempt means he simply gets the result of his hard endeavor. That's all. He doesn't get any substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> So with faith accept the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No faith-it is fact! Faith is blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Faith is blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Faith with good knowledge, that is nice. If you have good knowledge of Kṛṣṇa and you have faith, that is very good. But if you... Just like Māyāvādīs, they say, "Imagine Kṛṣṇa as God." They say, "Imagine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That is no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are no good. <span class="Italic">Kalpana.</span> They say, <span class="Italic">kalpana. Sādhakānāṁ gitarthaya(?) brahma-rūpa-kalpana. Rūpa-kalpana.</span> But Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rūpa</span> is not <span class="Italic">kalpana.</span> It is fact. So <span class="Italic">kalpana</span> is not faith, it is blind. Let me imagine some form of Kṛṣṇa. And therefore gradually, they come down to the position that any form you imagine as God, that is all right. They have come to this degradation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That you can, any form...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Any form you imagine that he is God, that will give you success. They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> I think I have taken too much of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going there at six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Words of enlightenment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Have you got any of Prabhupāda's books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> I have got some. I bought all the volumes of translation of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> I have got all of them. But some of them have not arrived from United States, the latest ones. And I have got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are staying in New Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> I stay in the Hague, and come to New Delhi when there are no cases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hague?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Holland.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Holland. That is the international court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Yes, the court case located, the headquarters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I went somewhere. That is also international. In Geneva, I think. Is there any...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Geneva is another headquarters of the, of the United Nations. New York, Geneva. But the court is in the Hague.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I went to that place in Geneva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Geneva has got so many specialized agencies of the United Nations, like the I.L.O. and so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think United Nations is making any tangible progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Sir, it at least brings people together under one umbrella to discuss. If you did not have that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But discussion, that I have already explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Sir, maybe, but if you don't discuss, you'll fight. Because if aim we don't meet at all then they will have the struggle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If you have no idea how to come to the conclusion, <span class="Italic">ciraṁ vicinvan.</span> You can forever go on discussing, you'll never come... You do not know what is the aim. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Maybe so, but if two people instead of coming to blows come together to talk, it is a step in the right direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No right direction because he does not know what is the aim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> They both want to have peace so they at least try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone wants that. But if he does not know how to attain peace, then go on discussing forever. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But it is still a step in the right direction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think there is any advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> ...otherwise what is the aim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise, there is, but you don't take. How it can be done? In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated</div>
<div class="Verse">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>5.29]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the process. But if you don't take it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But if that realization does not dawn... Till that realization...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you go on barking. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> (laughs) It's better to bark than to bite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is your satisfaction. You can do that peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> One day after barking they will come to a conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No that is... Let it be known, fact, that that will never come. If you do not know what is the aim. That is stated, <span class="Italic">durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> This is, means, a bad hope, that by this external exhibition of manipulation of energy, they will come to peace. It is not possible. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ adānta-gobhir... [SB </span>7.5.31].<span class="Italic"> Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.</span> This kind of leading is made by the blind leaders. If the leaders are blind and the followers are blind, what result will be there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> That is true, sir, but that stage has not come. One day it will come. But till that stage and that realization of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, stage is there. But if the obstinate persons, they do not take it... Here it is clearly said... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-loka-maheśvaram: [Bg. </span>5.29] "I am the proprietor of all the lands, all the planets." So how can you say no? There must be someone proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> But then God Himself has created the ego in man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He has created...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> God is the creator. He's also the creator of the ego of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has created ego. That is a fact, but you are utilizing the ego in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Because the realization is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is giving the intelligence but you are not accepting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> Maybe so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the difficulty. He has come to give you instruction, <span class="Italic">yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati [Bg. </span>4.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When you forget, there is <span class="Italic">glānir,</span> discrepancies, in the discharge of your duties, He comes to give you instruction, but you don't accept. Now what, can be done? The teacher is giving you instruction, but you don't accept. Then how you'll be educated? This is going on. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not accept. They will write comments on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in their own way. You see? Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> Yes. As it is. Don't comment in your own way. You'll not get any profit. Take for example any law, government law. Can I comment in my own way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you comment on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Doctor:</span> The law is meant for obedience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. Similarly, if you accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Lord then whatever He has said... Just like Arjuna says, <span class="Italic">sarvam etad ṛtaṁ manye yan māṁ vadasi keśava</span> [Bg. 10.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Whatever you are saying Keśava, I accept them <span class="Italic">in toto.</span>" That is acceptance.
