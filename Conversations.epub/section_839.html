<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...social welfare, and also he's minister for sport and recreation. He has come to see you, and this is his secretary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, I am very pleased to have the opportunity of meeting you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How long have you been in Australia?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just up to Sunday. Monday we are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we were here on the twentieth of July. We'll be here until Monday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What's the main reason for your visit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, about Kṛṣṇa. You have seen our books, our.... Show him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Have you seen Prabhupāda's books? The books I was just showing you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I am not very familiar with the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got very good response for accepting our books all over the world, Kṛṣṇa books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The reason that I was most interested to come is that my responsibilities in Victoria are a lot to do with the growth of our young people, and I think that many of the things that we don't succeed in doing, the problems that we have with drugs and alcohol and all sorts of unhappiness, that what your life indicates has got something that I think we could do well to take parts of it, to be involved in the things, the way in which we live. And I'd be interested to hear from you as to what you would believe might be done to encourage a greater acceptance of your areas of philosophy and religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our philosophy is to purify, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Our philosophy is to purify the core of the heart from all dirty things. This is basic principle of our philosophy, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,</span> cleansing the core of the heart. So just this morning several boys and girls became initiated. So our first promise is, before the Deity, before the fire, before the Vaiṣṇavas, before the spiritual master, that from this day no more illicit sex, no more intoxication, no more meat-eating, no more gambling. This is the first initiation. Then chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Very simple method. But one cannot practice these things without association of devotees. Nobody can do it outside. But here they are able; immediately they give up. All these boys, they were addicted to all these habits, but since they have come to the association, immediately they have given up, instantly. So you can bring any number of young men, and we shall be glad to make him free from all these things, practically engage him. It is open. If you like, you can take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. I am thinking more in terms of our general education system, for example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the best education. Our education begins when we learn to see all women as mother. That is the beginning of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> When we learn...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't require Ph.D. degrees to train him in such a way that a person will see, except his married wife, all women as mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Women as?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> As mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> As mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu.</span> This is the original system of education in India, <span class="Italic">mātṛvat para-dāreṣu,</span> to think of all women except his own wife as mother. <span class="Italic">Para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat:</span> "Others' money as the garbage in the street." Nobody touches the garbage. <span class="Italic">Mātṛvat para-dāreṣu para-dravyeṣu loṣṭravat, ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu:</span> "And one who sees all other living entities on the level of himself..." If you feel pinching, why should you pinch others? If one learns these three things, he is <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> he is learned. And another three things,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>5.29]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">When you accept Kṛṣṇa, or God.... When I say Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa means God. God is the proprietor of everything. Just take for example the United Nation. They are going and making noise, full speeches, for the last fifty years, but the fighting is going on. But they do not.... Why do they not pass a resolution that "This earth planet..." Take.... Only take this earth planet, earthly planet. Other you leave aside. "This is the property of God, and we are all sons of God. Let us enjoy the property of the..." But you will not allow. You Australian, you have got so much land. You won't allow anybody to come because you think it is your land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, I think, ah, if you're looking at the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, this is the principle. Actually it is not your land. You come from Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I agree that it's not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are now claiming it is your land. The Africans, they are claiming. So much land, you can produce ten times food grains for as many population as there are. Ten times milk is required, food grain is required. That is the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> If we produced all of the foods that we could produce and we literally gave them away to other countries that need them, we'd produce a tremendous disincentive in those countries for their own production. I don't think it's as easy, the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Production.... You take the total land as God's property, and all the population, they are sons of God. Then whole problem solved. Everything solved. If economic problem is solved, then social, political, religious, philosophical, everything is solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> If there was exchange for that money, I think you'd be right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No money required. No money required. Simply one is required to work to produce food grain. That's all. No money required. And God has given us so much land that we can produce food grain and we can keep cows' milk, and from milk we derive so many rich, nutritious, full of vitamins foodstuff that the whole economic question solved immediately. But we are producing.... Instead of food grain, we are producing tobacco for smoking cigarette. We are producing coffee for going to hell. So how you can expect social reformation? In Africa I have seen. Instead of producing grain, they are producing coffee, tea, and keeping the cows for killing, making business to sell meat to other countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is incense a form of intoxication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incense? No. Why intoxication?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incense keeps the atmosphere very nice, fresh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Very sweet-smelling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> This flower is not intoxicating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is just like in your country, what is that fragrance? Scent. Scent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Perfume?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfume is very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But I would have thought that in some ways it might have perform the same sort of function for some people as, say, smoking some cigarettes performs for others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In other words, it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on the particular man, what kind of flavor he wants. That is another thing. But there are different varieties of incense. Generally we use rose flavor, sandalwood flavor. We offer to the Deity room to keep the atmosphere very favorable. Originally in India it was <span class="Italic">dhūpa.</span> They used to put in the fire some flavored hulls, and it was very nice. That has been transferred into now stick incense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The stricture on the eating of meat, does that derive from the fact that animals have their lives which are accorded...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, vegetable, vegetable has got life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. What I'm asking is that because animals have a higher priority in life than vegetables?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No question of priority. Our philosophy is that we are servant of God. So God will eat, and whatever remnants of foodstuff He'll left, that we shall take. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> You find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like you have come here. So if I want to offer you something for eatable, it is my duty to ask you, "Mr. Nixon, which foodstuff you'll like to eat?" So you dictate, "I like this very much." Then, if I offer you that foodstuff, then you become pleased. So we have called Kṛṣṇa in this temple, so we are waiting, what foodstuff He wants to eat? So He said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "If one offer me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam.</span> He is asking very simple thing which everyone can offer. Just like a little leaf, <span class="Italic">patram,</span> a little flower, <span class="Italic">puṣpam,</span> a little fruit, and little liquid, either water or <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> er, milk. So we offer that. We make different varieties with these ingredients, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyam [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">,</span> and after Kṛṣṇa's eating, we take it. We are servant; we take the remnants of foodstuff left by Kṛṣṇa. We are neither vegetarian nor nonvegetarian. We are <span class="Italic">prasād</span>-ian. We don't care for vegetable or not vegetable, because either you kill a cow or kill a vegetable, the sinful action is there. And according to nature's law, it is said that "The animals which has no hand, that is the food for the animals with hands." We are also animals with hands. We human being, we are also animal with hands, and they are animals-no hand but four legs. And there are animals which has no leg, that is vegetable. <span class="Italic">Apadāni catuṣ-padām.</span> These animals which has no leg, they are food for the animals with four leg. Just like cow eats grass, the goat eats grass. So eating vegetable, there is no credit. Then the goats and the cows are more credit, have more credit, because they don't touch anything except vegetable. So we are not preaching to become goats and cows. No. We are preaching that you become servant of Kṛṣṇa. So whatever Kṛṣṇa eats, we eat. If Kṛṣṇa says that "Give me meat, give me eggs," so we shall offer Kṛṣṇa meat and eggs and we shall take it. So don't think that we are after vegetarian, nonvegetarian. No. That is not our philosophy. Because either you take vegetable or you take meat, you are killing. And you have to kill because otherwise you cannot live. That is nature's way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are not for that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, why do you put the stricture on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stricture in this way, no meat-eating, because cow protection is required. We require milk. And instead of taking milk, if we eat the cows, then where is milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So milk is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very, very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In terms of production of food for the world, the world would be much better off without eating animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, milk is required. Some fatty vitaminous food is required. That necessity is supplied by milk. Therefore specifically...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Couldn't you get all the necessity you require from grains?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grains, no. Grains, they are starch. According to medical science, we require four different groups: starch, carbohydrate, protein, and fat. That is full food. So you can get all these things by eating rice, <span class="Italic">dahl,</span> mean pulses, and wheat, and.... These things contain.... Pulses and wheat contains protein. And milk also contains protein. So protein we require. Fat we get from milk. Fat is required. And vegetables, carbohydrate; and food grain, starch. So if you prepare nice foodstuff with all these ingredients, you get full..., and offer to Kṛṣṇa, then it's purified. Then you are free from all sinful activities. Otherwise, even if you kill vegetable, you are sinful because it has got life. You have no right to kill another life. But you have to live on life. This is your position. Therefore the solution is that you take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> If there is sin by eating vegetable or meat it goes to the eater. We take the remnants, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You follow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Not exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The food that we take is first offered to Kṛṣṇa in the temple, so Kṛṣṇa is the first to eat. And Kṛṣṇa demands that "You offer Me this particular source of foodstuff." So one becomes free from all sinful reactions by first offering to Kṛṣṇa the foodstuff. Not only are you eating, but also you become free from sinful reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't think we are vegetarian. We can become anything, provided it is eaten from the remnants of foodstuff left by Kṛṣṇa. This is our.... To become vegetarian.... There are many animals who are vegetarians. The monkeys are vegetarian; the goats are vegetarian; the cows are vegetarian. So that is not a good qualification, to become vegetarian and become an animal. Or to become lion, tiger, dog. So either you are vegetarian or meat-eater, there are many animals. So we are not going to be animals. We are going to become human being. This is our philosophy. Grouping ourself to the vegetarian kingdom or nonvege.... The animals.... The tiger is a great nonvegetarian. Fresh blood they want to eat, drink.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Your Grace, do you keep in touch with the world through television or newspapers or the media?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, many newspaper, many television men, they come. But we speak our philosophy plainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Do you watch TV yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have no business. We don't wish to waste our time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Do you read newspapers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. What is newspaper? "This man is killed. This man has stolen. This politician has captured the government." So why shall I waste time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How do you become informed as to certain events? Is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got enough books to read, these books. If you read our books, in your whole lifetime you cannot finish it. And that is required to understand Kṛṣṇa. That is success of life. So why should.... Of course, we are in touch in the newspaper, but as much as it is required. We are in touch with the material world as much as it is required. We are interested in Kṛṣṇa. To help our Kṛṣṇa consciousness we may be in touch with the material world as much as possible. Just like we are riding car also, we are also using dictaphone, everything, but it is not for any ulterior purpose. It is for Kṛṣṇa's service. Just like we are writing books. This is Kṛṣṇa's service. People may understand about Kṛṣṇa, be benefited. This is our.... And in that way we are printing books, we are selling books, we are writing books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How many people are in the Kṛṣṇa movement in the world, about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About ten to twelve thousand, directly dedicated. Otherwise millions, they are reading our books. They have sympathy. We are selling books very nicely, daily twenty thousand dollar minimum all over the world. In learned circle, big, big universities, professors, they are appreciating. We have many congratulations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And the funds that you derive from the books...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Book Trust. That is explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...are used within your congre..., within the people that live in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I make a Book Trust. That is my will, that from all the collection of the books fifty percent for reprinting and fifty percent for expanding these temples, these buildings. In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We really don't require very much for our maintenance. As you can see, we live a very simple life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like these boys, they are practiced to sit down. We have kept two chairs for the visitors. (laughter) We don't require. We can lie down on the floor. We can use only one or two cloths, that's all, throughout the whole year. We have no demands, only bare necessities. We don't smoke, don't drink. There is no expenditure. Don't go to cinema, don't read newspaper or ordinary magazines, nothing. We have got reading matter. Practically we are noncooperating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Practically?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Noncooperating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Noncooperating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because we are not engaged in so many of the superfluous or unnecessary...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material amenities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> These things are described in Vedic terms as <span class="Italic">anartha.</span> They are not very important or very valuable to human advancement. What is really essential is advancement in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One of the principles upon which I have lived is a question of involvement with the people around me in trying to do things better than they have been done before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must know first of all what is the aim of life and what is better. That we must know. So that is described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that we are not interested in God; then whole thing is spoiled. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are not interested in God. We want to be happy by adjusting the external energy of God. That is blind leadership. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ.</span> This will never be successful, and it is blind leadership because we do not know what is the aim. If you know the aim of life and if we make program according to that aim, then it will be successful. Blindly everyone is manufacturing his objective, different leaders, different isms. The Communists, they have got different aims. The capitalists, they have got different aims. The socialists, they have got different aims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Is it true that there are more young people now in the world that are giving more serious thought to what life is really all about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they should. Because they are being educated, they are experiencing the faults of their fathers and grandfathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And they're able to tell that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are telling this is the aim. You take. And therefore more response from the younger section. All our devotees, they are just like my grandchildren. Their fathers may be like my children. But they are responsive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How do you spend a day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do we.... What do we do during the day? What are our activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got activities day and night, but because the body is there, we have to eat, but we eat Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> And naturally we go to sleep, to take some rest. Otherwise we are always engaged in Kṛṣṇa's business. We have no other business. So I go in the morning for little morning walk because the body, whole day if I sit down, it may be jammed. Therefore, for body's sake, I go for little walking. And then, whole day and night, I am sitting here, either chanting or writing books or talking with you, giving them direction. That's all. We have no other business than Kṛṣṇa's business. That is the peculiarity of this movement. Even if you take it is a religious movement, there is no religious movement in the whole world which has got twenty-four hours' engagement. You'll never find. The Christians go to the church once in a week for one hour, then closed. That is also not very regularly. Even if you take.... Our engagement. Twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every day. You can see how we are engaged twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Prabhupāda gets up at one o'clock in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last night I woke up at half past twelve. (laughter) Yes. So on the whole, utmost, I sleep four hours, two hours at night and two hours in daytime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I must.... Your Grace, I'm most grateful to have seen you. I must depart. Thank you very much for having me here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why, thank you for your coming. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Give him <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Good-bye. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...misleader. But he himself has no character. So here it is open secret, to keep a beautiful girl as secretary, everywhere in Europe and America. So where is purity? Purity? Marriage is a taboo, and keep secretary is very good job. And you can get secretary even free of charge. Rather, she will pay. So this is going on. In Vedic civilization marriage is one of the important function of life. As death is important function, birth is important function, similarly, marriage is also important function. <span class="Italic">Janma-mṛtyu-vivāha.</span> So in this age everywhere, not only.... The marriage is now farce. This is the symptom of Kali-yuga. There will be no more marriage. <span class="Italic">Svīkāra eva codvāhe.</span> Even there is marriage, there will be simply an agreement. That is happening, and it was written five thousand years ago. <span class="Italic">Svīkāra eva. Svīkāra</span> means by agreement, signing agreement. No marriage function.

Always in the <span class="Italic">Bhāg...</span> Nanda Mahārāja is giving in charity cows and money, and Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja is giving. Kṛṣṇa, as family man, He was giving in charity. So when the child is born, the horoscope is made, and to make the child happy, blessings of saintly persons, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they are given. Ordinary men also sumptuously fed. So <span class="Italic">bhūribhiḥ.</span>(?) Everyone gives some blessings so that the child is.... Then marriage. During marriage time.... You have seen Kṛṣṇa's mother's marriage? That was the system. The father gives to his heart content, as much as possible, to the daughter. The Kṛṣṇa's mother was royal prince, so her father gave so many elephants, so many horses, so many chariots. That was the system. [break] This <span class="Italic">śrāddha</span> ceremony. That is also, feeding the learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> saintly person, poor man, relative. Lavishly they spend money during three occasions: birth, death, and marriage. During birth the father spends; the marriage, father spends; and death, the son spends. This is the system. So social reformation, but there is no idea how the society will be happy. There is no idea. They are trying to remove this intoxication, LSD, but do not see the cause why LSD has come. They do not try to stop that cause. When the cause is effective, then they are disturbed with the effect. This is the defect. Neither they'll take advice. So how they'll be able to.... Big, big officer, drawing high salary, that's all. There is no effect. Neither there can be any effect. It is not possible. They do not know. Neither they want it. So we are advocating, "Remove these four sinful activities," so nobody will agree. "Illicit sex is our life, to keep a friend, to keep a secretary." And we are advising, "No illicit sex." Then where is life? That's all.</div>

And our feeling is in our own hearts we feel that we have a living feeling in what we call a testimony of Christ. And we feel that he is our savior and that he did atone for the sins of the world. And we were wondering what your feelings were about this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our feeling is direct, carrying the orders of God.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I teach my students to carry out. So anyone who will carry out the orders strictly, he will be perfect.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Surrender, oh. I think you're.... I believe that. It's interesting. Our prophet, when he passes on, we believe that another prophet will be called in his place by God to carry on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "By God" means.... Anyone who will carry out the order of God without any change, he is prophet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I have a question. Do you know much of Mormonism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No. Could I just share one experience, and I'd like your feeling on this. This is one thing that, the reason that we come throughout the world, and that is that we believe that in the year 1820 that there was a young man, Joseph Smith, who was confused about religion. And in this confused state he sought the Bible, and he read James 1:5, and the inspiration was to go seek God and ask Him in prayer. And in his prayer he had an experience where God the father and His son Jesus Christ appeared to him. Now, see this is what we base our religion about, is that a young man saw God and was visited by Him and His son Jesus Christ, and through him They used him as an instrument in restoring His true church. Now that's our testimony, and we believe this with all of our heart. We feel that it's built upon the spirit and that it's through prayer and study that we've found this. Now, what's your feeling about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if he has seen God, then God has given him some message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that message?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We believe that the message that God gave him was that the true church was not on the earth, and we believe that through Joseph Smith the true gospel of Jesus Christ was once again restored to the earth with all its power, with all its authority, and with the holy priesthood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Jesus Christ is authorized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, Jesus Christ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the order of Jesus Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's right, but what Jesus Christ says?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, Jesus Christ, we believe that when he lived as a mortal man, he organized the church, and the people followed him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the instruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> The instructions to Joseph Smith was, well, in a ten-year period of time, from 1820 to 1830 many things happened to Joseph Smith. One thing was that he was visited by an angel called Moronai, who lived fourteen hundred years earlier in the Americas, and he was a prophet, and he wrote a book and sealed it away, and it was written on gold plates. Joseph Smith translated this ancient work of Egyptian hieroglyphics into English, and it was called the Book of Mormon after a great prophet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the message?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, the message is that the church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints is the kingdom of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the church of Jesus Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, Jesus Christ's church, that's simply it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chastity is being followed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes. The church teaches it, and people who do not obey it are bringing condemnation upon themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is my injunct..., that if.... The commandment is that women should be chaste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Exactly.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, see, this is the great thing of the atonement. See, when Christ suffered the sins of the world on Gethsemane...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why for your sin Christ should suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Christ suffered for my sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, because he loved us and he was the only begotten son of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you'll go on committing sins and Christ will suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, see Christ only forgives when you repent. See what I mean? See, this is the thing I want to say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this has become a business, that I commit sin and repent. "We believe, I repent, and again I commit sin." Do you think it is very good business?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are not Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then where is Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, the Christian world that the majority of the people think is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Majority is not the calculation. Minority. If one person carries out the order of Christ, then he is Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise they are not Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> That's right. But I just wanted to say one thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our principle is that if one person carries out the order of God, he is actually the prophet. If he does not carry out-simply by dress he is prophet-it is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I see. All right. We have a little different feeling about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it should be different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you [are] actually the servant of God, you must carry out the orders of God. There cannot be difference. If there is difference, that means you are no longer servant of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we feel that God has always had prophets and called them Himself, as he called Mike Aran.(indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how the prophet can disobey the original orders of God or Christ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> How can a prophet disobey? We don't.... A prophet doesn't disobey. We believe that the prophet at the head of our church, Spencer W. Kimble, speaks with God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> And he conveys His messages on to us as church members and on to the rest of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is.... Just like the two points here: chastity and nonviolence. But this is not being carried out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the prophet and where is the followers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, see, the prophet is teaching the people about this and teaching them to live it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means people are not obeying the prophet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, people are. We are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how it is said that.... How they are killing animals? How the women are unchaste?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> All people aren't following the prophet. All people in your belief aren't following you completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very nice. My point is that if we follow God-God's message is carried by prophet, and prophet if obeyed by the people-then the religion is in order. Otherwise it is a bogus religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, I think we would agree there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We must follow; then it is all right. We don't follow, and still we rubberstamp, "I am Christian. I am this. I am that." This is the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Would you agree that Christ is the greatest master of all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. We accept him as our guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> What is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru means prophet, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> What about a savior?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Savior? Who saves the followers from the danger of materialistic way of life, which means transmigration of the soul from one body to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Do you believe in a resurrection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Resurrection? What do you mean actually? But it is a fact that one, the soul, is changing from one body to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That's what.... We agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like you are young man. You had a body of a child. That child's body.... You remember that you had a body of a child, but that body is no longer existing. But you remember; therefore you, the owner of the body, is existing. Otherwise how do you remember, "I had a body like, like this," measurement? But that body is no longer existing, so you are remembering. So you are the owner of the body. Just like you have now black coat. Say after two days you may put on another color coat, but you remember that "I was putting on one black coat on that day." So you are existing; the coat is changed. Similarly, the soul is existing; the body is changed. Therefore it is natural that I am old man. When I change this body, I get another body. This is resurrection, if you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I believe that, yes. That's what we believe put in a philosophical way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not belief, it is fact. You believe or not believe, it will take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, that's right, it will take place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We just see it differently. We believe that after this life we'll be resurrected into a glorified, perfect body of flesh and bones and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. That we say. We say twice, that.... Just last night I was discussing that this human form of life is to make our choice, whether we are going to get a body back to home, back to Godhead, or again we are going in the cycle of birth and death. This is our choice. If we act according to the orders of God, then we go to Him, back to home, back to Godhead. And if we still whimsically act, then I go again in the cycle of birth and death. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we.... See, we desire and strive to follow out the orders of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is perfection of life. But if we don't do that, then we are going again to the evolutionary process...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of birth and death. It will depend on my action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Exactly. Will you agree with this point, that we are not perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, anyone who follows the order of God, he is perfect. Otherwise all are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Can you be completely perfect and follow the orders perfectly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, why not? Just like what is the order of God? God wants that "You shall always think of Me, 'The God is my Supreme Father.' " So what is the difficulty? Now, if you think, "God is the Supreme. God is the Supreme Father," if you think like that, where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We believe that God is Supreme, He is like you say. But we believe we are constantly striving to become perfect, every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why constantly striving? God says that "You think of Me." So where is my difficulty to think of Him unless I am disobedient? I can think of God always. There is no difficulty. There is no expenditure. There is no disadvantage. But if I am rascal, I'll disobey. That is the.... If I am rascal, then I will disobey. I will not think of God. I'll think of something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, this is.... I guess you have a different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> ...concept of Christ because we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Christ said that "You accept me as the Supreme." So why the people do not accept him as the Su...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we accept him, but, see, he had to be a savior...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you accept him in this way, that "Let me commit all kinds of nonsense, and Christ will suffer."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, no. We don't.... See, we believe...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do the Christians not think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "Christ has died for our sins," but they continue to sin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, many people do. But see, what I'm saying, what I'm saying is that I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are.... Individually it is all right. But people think like that, that "Christ has taken contract..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, they're wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...that whatever nonsense we do, he will suffer, and let us do it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> We will have to suffer if we do not repent. See, we have a scripture that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they say Christ will suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> He has already suffered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say, still they will suffer. Therefore Christian religion is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> He has suffered...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Christian people say like that, that "We cannot become pious. We.... Let us go on doing all nonsense, and Christ will suffer." Is that very good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I agree with you, see. I really do. But what I'm saying is I believe that we're not all perfect, and we're working for perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I say that what is the difficulty to become perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we have to learn and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means we are nonsense. If there is no difficulty to become perfect and still we remain imperfect, that means we are nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I see, well, okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you are first-class nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I see. All right, well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the difficulty? Christ's picture is there. Suppose we have got our picture, Kṛṣṇa. So all right, don't believe in Kṛṣṇa. But you have got picture of Christ, and you can see that he is being crucified. The cross is your symbol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> We don't worship the dead Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not, but Christians.... The Christians, they put the cross, a reminder that "Christ suffered for us." This is the cross. So we became sinful, and the Lord, he suffered for us. We should stop this sinful activity. That is sanity. But "Christ will suffer, he'll be repeatedly crucified, and we shall go on with our nonsense activity." Is that religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, I agree with you there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But I have a different thought and feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may have, but we are talking on the principle that if we are so base and fallen down that we go on committing sinful life and "Christ will be crucified; I'll be saved," that way is said, what kind of religion? "One should continually suffer for my sin, and I am free to act sinfully." Is that religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we don't believe that Christ continues to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but the Christians do that. They are maintaining.... Christ says, "Thou shall not kill," and they are maintaining thousands of killing house, and still they are passing on as Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, they're wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I agree with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you should tell them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we are. That's what we're here for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that "You are not Christian. Don't call yourself as Christian. You are persistently disobeying, beginning..." Christ said, "Thou shall not kill," and the Christians began killing Christ, crucifying Christ. And that is going on still, in large scale, and they are still Christian. The Pope is eating meat and.... I do not wish to say so many things. These are going on, and still, they are Christians. What can I say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Do you believe that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not a question of believe or not believe. We are talking of fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, okay. Would, say, the cutting down of a plant, vegetable.... You are killing the growth there. Is that a living matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killing means that you have to eat something. Our philosophy is that we cannot stop killing, but there is no unnecessary killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> We agree. We only kill for what we need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But you.... Just like in.... Just a minute before, I ate so many nice fruits. So these fruits are meant for human being. Why shall I eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The same grain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> It was Mormon scripture that said also, I read it, God is speaking, and He requests not to eat meat except in times of famine and starvation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> But the Mormons don't do that. They still eat meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You're feeding the cow, the beef, grains which you could eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> What does the cow eat? Grains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You are feeding the beef grains to fatten it for slaughter, but you could eat the same grains and be healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's true. And we have many people who are in the church who strive to teach people of the church to eat more grains and milk products and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is not the point Śrīla Prabhupāda is making.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, point is that every living being has to eat another living being. That is the law of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jivo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> That we admit. But in the human form of life if one thinks-now they are eating-that "Another living being is my food, so I kill my own child and eat," so you mean to say to apply the same law, that "A living entity is food for another living entity. Therefore a human being kill his own child and eat?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, see, we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Discrimination is the best part of valor." So you have to eat something, but if you have got grains, vegetables, milk, very nice preparation, why should you kill cow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, we believe that the Lord ordained that food for man, and that He even said in scripture to the prophet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He said? He ordained cow for your food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He ordained meat. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> But only in times of starvation and famine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, the matter.... It also said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> That is the word of wisdom in the Mormon scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I don't want to get in contentions about it, but the scripture also says that who abstains from meat is not ordained of God. So you can take it whatever way you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? "One who abstains from meat"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, he's trying to say that the Mormons overeat meat. And all I'm saying is, well, the scripture which was revealed to the modern-day prophet Joseph Smith was that "Whoever.... Who does abstained from meat is not ordained of God." And I have no intentions to get contentious about it. So all I'm saying is I'm honored to be here, and it's good to be here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the point is that in the Commandment it is clearly said, "Thou shall not kill." So what does it mean? That unless there is absolute necessity, we shall not kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think that's right, and I feel that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when.... At least in America or any civilized country, there is ample food for human being. Why they should kill? If you can live without killing cows, if you can utilize cows in a different way.... Just like we are maintaining a farm-not one, many. They are maintaining cows and we are getting enough milk. And from milk we can prepare varieties of palatable, vitaminous, nutritious food. And that is very, very enjoyable. So let the animal live and take the milk, and just like we.... None of us, we take meat, but we are not dying. We are having so many nice preparation from milk, from grains, from fruit. Besides that, our another principle is that we offer to God. So God said that "Give Me vegetables, milk," like that. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we offer these things, and we take the leftover. That is our principle. We are not after killing or not killing. We are simply after obeying the orders of Kṛṣṇa. That is our. So Kṛṣṇa says, "Give Me food from the vegetables." So we offer Him very nice, palatable dishes and eat. This is our principle. So even while eating, we remember God: "Kṛṣṇa has so nicely eaten this. Let me take the remnants." So while eating, we are remembering God. So if God said that "You remember Me always," we can do it. He has explained how to remember Him. He said, <span class="Italic">raso 'ham apsu kaunteya: [Bg. </span>7.8] "I am the taste of the water." So when you drink.... Who is not drinking water? At least three times, four times we drink water, everyone. So when you drink, and the water quenches your thirst, and you feel some taste nice, Kṛṣṇa says, God says, "I am that taste." So where is my difficulty to remember God? If you simply remember this formula, that "The taste of the water is Kṛṣṇa," immediately you remember Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span> "I am the shining of the sun, shining of the moon." So who does not see the shining of the sun and the moon? At night you see the shining of moon, and day you see.... So where is the chance of forgetting God? There is no chance at all. As soon as you see the sunshine even, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." As soon as see the moonshine, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." As soon as you taste water, "Oh, here is Kṛṣṇa." So in this way there is list that you cannot avoid the chance of remembering Kṛṣṇa. Every moment, every time, you can remember Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa, God, says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ:</span> "You always think of Me." So where is my difficulty to think of Kṛṣṇa? Unless I purposefully do not do it. It is not that when I go to the church and temple I can remember. I can remember Him twenty-four hours. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I think that's right, and I think that many people I know personally are what you say Kṛṣṇa conscious. They think of God and Christ twenty-four hours a day too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted. We obey the orders of Christ-we think of always-then we are perfect. Either Christ, the son of God, or God, Kṛṣṇa, the same thing. God and son of God, they are not different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> We were wondering if we could give you a personal gift that means a lot to us. We've got a Book of Mormon with us, and I don't know if you have one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But we feel that it's a scripture written by ancient people who lived in the South and Central American continents from the years 600 B.C. to A.D. 400. And we thought that this was kind of a special opportunity, and we didn't know if you had one. And we were wondering if we could leave you one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Great. I've got it right here. We don't want to take too much more of your time. We'll leave you our card. Would that be all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> It's been a very enjoyable experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can give one book, <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Can you take one of our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Fine. It would be an honor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> We'll read this. We promise to read this if you promise to read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no question of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Because he has read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can read one of the best portion from this book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Pardon me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Recite the best portion. Of course, everywhere is best. Still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> All right. Let me think for one moment. (pause) Let me read just a couple verses here, and then I'll read a few more here. "Believe in God..." (to other Mormon:) Would you read this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I'm tired and my voice is tired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> These two verses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> "Believe in God, believe that He is and that..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Believe that"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> "That He is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> "...both in heaven and in earth. Believe that He has all wisdom and all power both in heaven and in earth. Believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend. And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them and humble yourselves before God and ask Him sincerely of heart that He will forgive you. And now, if you believe all these things, see that you do them. And again I say unto you, as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of His goodness and have tasted of His love and have received the remission of your sins, which causes such exceeding great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember and always retain in remembrance the greatness of God and your own nothingness, and His goodness and long suffering towards you unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come which was spoken by the mouth of the angel."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is very nice. But.... Let me see that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There was one section there that mentions about chanting the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> "Calling on the name of the Lord daily."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is very close to what we teach, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is? Eleven?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Eleven, at the bottom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "And again I say unto you, as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if you have known of His goodness and have tasted of His love and have received a remission of your sins, which causes such exceeding great joy in your souls, even so, I would that ye should remember..." No, the things are very nice. That soul is admitted. "Your soul"-soul is admitted. That sinful activities are admitted. Goodness of God is admitted. So there is no difference between this gospel and other religious book. This is the principle. The point is what are the sins? Unless you know what are the sins, how you can avoid sins?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> You can't. You have to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what are the sins? That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, when you disobey His orders, and He's got many commandments, and they are in the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore I was raising that question, that anyone who is not obeying the Ten Commandments of the Christian religion, then how he's a Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How is he a Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if he does not obey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> If he does not obey them he is breaking the orders of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then these question do not arise at all, because he does not know what are sins and what are to be avoided and how to love God. These things required. There is a process. Just like if you want to love a girl or a girl wants to love you, there is a process. Unless there is no love. If you do not follow the process.... Suppose.... These are the general principles. If you love somebody you give something, some presentation. That you have given me, the presentation. It is a question of love. You are not giving to anyone, but you have got some love. So you give something to God. The first question of love is that "What you are giving to God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What am I giving to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, I want to give everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You want to, but practically what you are giving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> What am I giving now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I mean to say, anyone. Here.... Here is a process. Just like in our temple they have dedicated everything to God, the life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, we likewise went through a temple, a sacred place, and in there we have made covenants to give everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So love of God means six things. This is the difference between other literature and Vedic literature. Here it is said, "love of God," but in the Vedic literature you will find the process of love,</div>

<div class="Purp-para">Nine different processes. First of all you should hear about the glories of God, <span class="Italic">śravaṇam.</span> Then you should preach the glories of God. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ.</span> You should always remember God, <span class="Italic">smaraṇam. Pāda-sevanam:</span> you should worship the Lord by worshiping, giving service to His lotus feet. But if God is imperson, where is feet? And if God is no form, then how you can remember Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We believe God has form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But, then next question will be "What is the form?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We believe in a man, form of a man, flesh and bone, glorified and perfected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you believe that man is God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Not man is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? God is like man. You mean to say the form of God is like man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No, flesh and bone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Flesh and bone, glorified and perfected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Matter. God has a material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Of glory and perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, how do you glorify the flesh and bone? It is very hard? It is very nice to eat? Is that glorification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's not difficult, I don't.... My feeling.... God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't bring your feeling. I mean to say, you must bring scriptural order. How do you glorify flesh and bone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, Christ brought that about in the resurrection, when he was resurrected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you say? Practically say that how you glorify a lump of flesh and piece of bone? That is my question. What is the glorification of a lump of flesh and a piece of bone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> God can do it. That's all I can say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot do it. Can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But God can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we do not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> The question is, "How can we glorify God if He's made of flesh and bone?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How can we glorify God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> There's a little bit of communication gap here. You don't quite understand our thoughts, and we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> We understand. He just asked you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And we don't quite understand yours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He asked you, how do you worship a piece of flesh and piece of bone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's a piece of glorified flesh and a piece of glorified bone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> How is flesh glorified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Flesh means material, temporary, imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I'm not perfect. This is not temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you bring some flesh from slaughterhouse and glorify it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Could I ask a question? I was told, if I'm not right, that down there in a section of your temple you worship the workmanship of flesh. A man made it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We never do that. Who told you? Who is the rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, it was one of your followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He's interpreting that to be the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is his interpretation of the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Of Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is his interpretation of what is the Deity, that it is man-made, matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do think that, that the form of God is man-made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, all I can.... I just.... That's my feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be your feeling, but that does not mean that is our feeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, okay. Your feeling does not mean that our feeling is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we don't say. I am simply asking that how do you glorify flesh and bone? I do not know. I am asking you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I don't know. God knows, is what I'm saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that? You do not know your system of glorification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, glorification comes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am asking-I am a layman-that you say "glorified flesh and bone," but you say, "I don't know."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Can I ask a question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Do you consider.... Is it your Deity? Do you consider that glorified?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the Deity is the form of the Lord, but when you say, "the bone and flesh," so how we can accept as Deity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Now, you say that the Deity is the form of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Now you've also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Also here is. Here is the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, that's an angel called Moronai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Angel," but you cannot dishonor him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's in honor of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You honor him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you put this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> It's just a picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you don't honor him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Don't honor him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of picture? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Could I ask you another question? Could I ask you another question? You've been hitting on some of the Ten Commandments tonight like "Thou shall not kill." Now, if you believe the Ten Commandments like that, it also says in there that you shouldn't worship idols, bow down to idols.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we don't worship idol. We worship God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, we just have a.... We don't need to discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like here is the picture of God. As you say, this picture is not important, but we say it is important because it is picture of God. Because it is important, therefore you have given the picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, we say that that picture is important because it's in commemoration or something of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you offer some honor. Otherwise why do you give this picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Honor, not worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They put this on the top of their temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> On one, two of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I have seen in Salt Lake City.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Salt Lake City and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, anywhere, top of.... Here you are giving a particular picture. That means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Gold and silver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop. That means you have got respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We have respect. We do not worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means that respect is partial. Our process is whomever we respect, we worship him. That is more perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, all right. That's fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is perfection. If you respect somebody you must worship him. Just like.... Nowadays it has become a fashion. I don't.... That is European fashion, that you respect some gentleman, political or social, who has done good service to your country, but you keep him in a public park and the crows are passing stool on his head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Make a statue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Statue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If you want to glorify some great personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we, if we keep that statue in a temple, is it not more respectful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I expose the statue on the open field and the crows and birds are passing stool on his head and it is going down his mouth, is it respectful? Do you think it is respectful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Probably not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if that statue is kept in a temple and you dress, you garland, you offer food, is it not more respectful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Offer food to an idol?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not an idol. This is a point Prabhupāda is making.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is how to offer respect, that if you respect a person, so if you expose this form of the person on the public park, giving the crows chance to pass stool on his head, that is more respectful? Or if you keep that statue in a temple and daily dress him and garland him and offer him food, that is more respectful? Which is more respectful? You are doing the same thing, but you are exposing to the stool of birds and crows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, see, you have a misunderstanding of the representation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No misunderstanding. It is a common sense that if you have got respect for a person, instead of installing his form-either it is statue or stone, it doesn't matter-keeping it outside and giving chance the bird to pass stool on his head, if you keep that statue in a nice place, which is more respectful? That is my question. It is a common sense. If you have got respect for a person.... You have installed the statue. Don't call Deity. Statue. So which is more respectful, to keep him exposed on the open field or to keep him in a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, I think if I was looking at it in your point of view, it would be more respectful to put him inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's the.... That is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That's your point of view, not ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? That is your.... I do not know what is your point of view, that you expose this to the open air and the birds pass stool on it and you still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It is simply a workmanship of man to make the building maybe more...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am just talking on the practical point of view. Which is more respectful? Apart from other points, if we actually offer somebody respect, then you must give him proper respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But, see, we do not see Moronai in that.... Moronai does not reside...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not see that the crows passing stool? You do not see it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> He might. He might do something on it. But he's not doing it on Moronai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose your father's statue is there, and crow passing on the nose stool. You don't feel that "My father's statue is..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, I don't think that it was done on Moronai because Moronai is not in that statue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Moronai, anyone. I am not.... But there are so many statues, so many statues in the open field, and they are exposed to the birds for passing stool. Do you think it is more respectful than one keeping the same statue in a nice sacred temple and worshiping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, it's nice. They should.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you criticize the person who is keeping the statue within a temple, "the heathen worship, idol worship," and you keep your father's statue exposed for passing stool on his head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> You know, if you're going to liken it unto that, I can also liken it unto your statues down here in your temple...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, take it as statue, but where is good sense, to keep a statue within a temple or to keep it open field for passing stool by the birds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Okay, here is some of my good sense. You've got your statues in your temple, and I notice there were a lot of flies in there the other night crawling all over it and doing their, whatever they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do you mean a fly coming and crow passing stool is the same thing? Very good sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Well, flies leave mess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, it was painful to see the flies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> That's why they have the whisk you see. We try to whisk the flies away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can try as much as possible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very good reason that, "Because the flies cannot be checked, and the crows should be allowed to pass stool?" At least you stop the crows. If you cannot stop the flies, but you can stop the crows. We have done that. We don't allow the crows to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That's good. That's very good. We have taken a lot of your time, Your Grace, and we are very honored and thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are talking frankly. That's nice. Our point is that.... That is our philosophy, that if we want to be God conscious, we must abide by His order, just like here it is very nicely written. I very much appreciate this thing. But we must practically do that. And what is that? "Again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God." Now, it is conditional. "You have come to the knowledge of the glory of..." Now, what is that knowledge, glory of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, that is to know that He lives and that He loves you, and that one day you can live with Him again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And when you have that knowledge, I think that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is more explicitly explained, as I was explaining, that you feel the presence of God every time, as in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is said that when you are drinking water you immediately glorify God, "Oh, God has created this water so tasteful. It is quenching my thirst."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is easy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Could I read you something out of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, I can understand. The things are all right. Things are all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's on the other side of the page and it talks about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I am giving you the process. You have written, "the glory of God," and I am giving you the process how to glorify God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Oh, thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here is the process. You are drinking water, and "Oh, how Kṛṣṇa, God, is so glorified. I was so much thirsty, and just drinking this water, this is quenching my thirst." This is glorification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I like that. That's good. I like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is the difference. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means know how to glorify God, not theoretical-practical. Here is practically example. Everyone drinks water, and while drinking water he can glorify thousand times. That we are teaching. <span class="Italic">Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span> As soon as you see sunlight, "Oh, we are suffering for want of sunlight. Here is God's glory. He has sent the sunlight." This is practical. So one must know how to glorify God practically. Then his life is successful. God is always glorious. There is no doubt about it. But for us, how to glorify God.... Similarly, when we worship the Deity, here is God. Just offer Him flower. Just offer Him dress. That is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every item, there is practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We think that also to glorify God is to obey His...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You think but you see also practically that how these people are practically doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Excuse my manner of speech. I've come to know that to glorify God and that is to obey His will and do His will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the.... So that is the order in our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The first order is <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> So "Always think of Me." And He is giving the process how to think of Him. Not that He simply leaves you that "Think of Me," but He is giving practical way. <span class="Italic">Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Now, when you drink water you can think of Me. When you see the sunshine you can think of Me. When you see the moonshine you can.... When there is sound you can think of Me." In this way there is list. If you time, I can explain that list. Have you got time? Bring me that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Well, have you got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. So practical, that how to think of God, how to glorify Him, that there must be some practical life. That we are teaching, because everything is glorification of God. We cannot manufacture the sunshine. Therefore sunshine, it is glorification of God. We cannot manufacture the moonshine; therefore moonshine is glorification of God. So in this way you have to practically learn how to glorify God. Then life will be very nice. That we are teaching. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So you should.... So if you like, you can take this book also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Could we have an autograph of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, yes. They want you to sign it, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How much does one of these cost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Could we have two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I met one Christian in Florida. He once said that by hearing our philosophy he felt he became a life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the date? Twenty-third?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Twenty-third.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> It's a good philosophy. I am really respect the Kṛṣṇa's for their discipline, because this is a great thing that people of the world need to learn, is to discipline your body, because we think that if you discipline your body, the spirit of God can dwell with you more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We were going to get one more book, buy it, and have you sign another one. Would that be all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're just bringing one more copy. They want one each. No, they want one copy each of <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span> So he's just waiting. He would like you to sign that one also, if you could.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why don't you read one of these? I think you'd be interested in some of the finer points in the philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How much would that be? We can't afford too...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It only costs four dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> We can't afford that. Something small.... Does it have a picture of him in there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a picture of Prabhupāda in the back of that one, in the back. On the inside also there's just a few notes about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paper is ripped. Another copy. (end)</div>
