<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span>Bhagatji may go to Hyderabad. I am sending him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That will be a great loss for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I said that you must be able to compensate yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should know how, especially dealing with the municipality men. [break] For Rādhā-Mādhava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Something to do with Rādhā-Rāmaṇa Mandira in Vṛndāvana. I think one is Puruṣottama. Anyway, the first night we did a very nice program, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>, and everyone was joining in dancing with us. We were dancing and they were all joining. And the second night they cancelled our program. We were trying to sell books in the front of the <span class="Italic">pandal</span> and they were giving us trouble for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they are envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They are envious. Very envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you joined them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> I did not know. I thought it would be a good opportunity. They promised me they would give us a good program and good accommodation. When we got there, they did not like that we were very popular. (tape breaks up throughout) Then Mr. Bishop (indistinct) brother, T.C. [break] ...tour, he is a good man. He came with... [break] He is one of the most respected men in Bareilly. He forced them to put the program back again. So we did again the same evening. The people there love our program. They are all supposed... They have pictures of Caitanya Mahāprabhu on the stage and they're supposed to be following Him but they sing all these <span class="Italic">sahajiyā</span> sort of songs and they sit down and it's all <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span> There's no, There's no real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Just a business. We also had a program with Dr. Gupta (?). That was a nice program. And his wife she cooked some Bengali <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> for us. We took our lunch there. That was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think that he is disciple of Tīrtha Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. But his son... His house, they have so many pictures of Ramakrishna and Sai Baba. His son is telling him to not follow the same like his father. And his father did not speak. He only spoke about three words. He's suffering from some rheumatism or something. Anyway, we had a good <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> there. [break] No, I never say, I never say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But all the people who are Sai Baba followers, they all do have some activity in the mode of ignorance. They eat meat or onions. By their symptoms, we can see that they're in the mode of ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> ...at Meerut by Mr. Brijmohan Gad. He has come. He's in our guesthouse now. Actually he just came here this morning. We stayed in his house. That's was also a good... That is a good town also. Altogether we made fifteen life members in about two weeks. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...bring Hindi books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes, we need Hindi books. I met one man in Meerut, Hindi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. And he is the brother of, he said, I think the nephew of Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa Adhikārī in London. His name is Mr. K.M. Gupta. I think he has taken initiation from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think. K.M. Gupta has given. Kṣīrodakaśāyī is my...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa Adhikārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> And he said that you have seen his one chapter of his translation and have approved it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> No, is that not true? I asked him for a copy but he said that he only had one copy he was sending to London and one he was keeping for himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he is translating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes. And he said if we wanted a copy we could send a man and he could copy it down. He's done the first three chapters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> What did he say his initiated name is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not initiated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> The man who is translating is not initiated. His uncle, Kṣīrodakaśāyī dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> How many your program up to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> How many boys? Of our boys, we were seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian, or?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> There was one Indian boy but he was very sick. We took him with us. He was very sick so I sent him back here to Vṛndāvana. I took him because he had given one class in Hindi in the temple and Mahārāja said that you had liked that. He was too sick. Physically and mentally sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He's okay now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No cloud. In the street it is very disturbing. [break] ...party, they are also touring? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They have groups in different towns. They have in Birelli and Harpur. They don't travel and preach. I've met them in Ghaziabad also. They were the same. They were very envious, and they would not help. Also in Harpur they were the same. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like our poison, (?) more. Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Oh yes. The people are gullible. They do not know. They are more attracted to us. But we are not always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Occasionally, you find cities. [Break] You cannot speak Hindi, still they like? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They like us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like our <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they like. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven person you took in a car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Some of the boys went in a bus. We had a bus also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> That belongs to Yaśodānandana Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bus, why do you take the car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Well, the bus is not with me. My program is separate from the bus program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Now the bus is gone to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should take two cars? [break] Where you are staying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Some of us stayed in Anand Ashram. There is one <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> there called Anand Ashram in the civil lines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that <span class="Italic">āśrama?</span> Anand Ashram?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They have got Deities of... They have got... In the main <span class="Italic">bhavana</span> they have got Lord Śiva and Pārvatī in the center, big deities. And then they have got Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa at the side and Rāma and Sītā on the other side. They also told me to go. After some days they said we had to go. They did not like us. And we did not do anything wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> After how many days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> After about one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Usually three days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were feeding you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Why they did not like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> It's difficult to say. I think it is envy. The swami who was there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes, he's a Māyāvādī. He did not like it when the other people take an interest in us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And they see that people are giving us money too. (Prabhupāda laughs) Actually wherever we go, with a few exceptions, wherever we go, after the third day we just suddenly become unwelcome even though we behave all right. The third day is about the limit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> The one exception is this Gita Bhavan in Indore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> There are a few exceptions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> They were nice to us there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are nice. Once I had been there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes, they told me you had been there. That is why they are nice to us. Wherever you have been there has been some change of heart. In Indore there is some definite effect from that. (end)</div>
