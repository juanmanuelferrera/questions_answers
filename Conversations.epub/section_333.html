<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The sky is quite clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Can you change it? Can you change it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what kind of scientist you are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> A rascal scientist. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, may I put a question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Yesterday I made the acquaintance of a theologist, a professor from the University of Montreal. He said that the Roman Catholic presentation of Christianity is that God came to share the suffering of man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another rascaldom. Why God should share the sufferings of man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> I asked him this, and he said, "So that man would accept more as reality, suffering."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good theologician. A rascal number one. You are trying for becoming happy, and his theory is that man will accept suffering. You see? The very proposition is rascaldom. Everyone is trying for to become happy. That is progress. <span class="Italic">Ātyantika.</span> In Sanskrit it is called <span class="Italic">ātyantika-duḥkha-nivṛttiḥ.</span> There is suffering, and our struggle for existence means to, I mean to say, mitigate the suffering, to minimize or to make it nil. That is our struggle. We are not submitting to suffering. Then what is the civilization? What is human civilization: We don't want suffering. That is our position. Why this rascal says that "We shall suffer"? Just see. The theologician is a rascal. Therefore we say everyone rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The same theologician, Prabhupāda, he calls himself an atheist theist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> He said, "I am an atheist theist."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheist theist? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Just rascal, double talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another rascal. Another rascal proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> I asked him, "How can a theologist be an atheist?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole thing is that because the whole world is full of rascals, they are all talking nonsense. No meaning. No meaning. It is only we, we have pointed out that "You are a rascal. You speak all nonsense." Now, taking this word atheist, what does he mean by atheist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Without theism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is not explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Atheist means not believing in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Say like that. Don't say in a negative way. In a positive way. What does it mean? Atheist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> He says there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no God. Then what do you mean by God? Next question. Next question will be what do you mean by God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> So he'll say the conception which has been presented by the different religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your conception? Why do you go to different religions? You are talking with me. So you say, what do you mean by God? Next question will be this. Don't go to others. Don't fly away. You are atheist. You are posing yourself atheist. Atheist means one who does not believe in God. That's all right. Now what do you mean by God? First of all the thing must be there. Then you believe or not believe next. Just like here is a person. He says, "I believe in him." I say, "I don't believe in him." But the person is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, he'll say, "God is just an idea."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. But ideas don't always represent facts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So idea is there. You say that it is not fact, but others say it is a fact. So how it will be mitigated? How it will be settled? "God" word is there. You say that it is an idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> A "sky flower" is an idea, but it's not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just like God, let us stick on word, that God... You say it is an idea only. I say it is not an idea. It is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, then they say, "By objective empirical analysis it has to be researched, scientific."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then let us analyze, analyze. Let us analyze. That... We say that God means Supreme, Supreme Being. So how you can say that Supreme Being is an idea? How you can say? You accept Supreme Being. So how you can say it is idea? It is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say there is no necessity for a Supreme Being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there's a necessity. If you don't accept, then you will be beaten with shoes. Because as soon as there is light, you have to accept supreme authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But that's an authority we have imposed upon ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because there is need, therefore you have done it. There is necessity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, some of them say, because people are generally ignorant, therefore we need this idea of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are less than ignorant. You are less than ignorant. You are less than rascal. If I call you a rascal, then I give you some honor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Lenin said that God is just opiate of the people, just to keep them intoxicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, no. That means Lenin wanted to become God. That's all. The God idea is there, but he cannot be God. Because he was under the laws of God, he died. He died. He could not save himself from death. Therefore he is not supreme authority. He accepted supreme authority, but he wanted himself to become the supreme authority. Now, when he died, he is not supreme authority. He is forced to die. Then there is another supreme authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, then they can say ultimately death is meaningless anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why meaningless? Then why you are afraid of death when I come to kill you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that it's meaningless doesn't mean I can't place some value on it at any given point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why meaningless? It has meaning. Then why you are fighting? Why you fought for Russian Revolution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they give the example like numbers. Numbers are only useful for a purpose, but actually they are meaningless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The purpose is meaningless then. Then your purpose is meaningless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes, they say ultimately everything is meaningless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are a rascal. You are working for meaningless things. Then you are a rascal. That's all. And that is my version, that you are a rascal number one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say everyone can introduce their own meaning to whatever they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then why do you try to get many followers? Let them do their own work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, to proliferate your own meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you have got own meaning. You be satisfied with your own meaning. I have got my own meaning. Why do you bother me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, my meaning may be to bother you. That may be part of my meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then my meaning is to beat you with shoes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Lenin, no one ever beat him. He was not beat. He beat everyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He was also beaten-by death. He died also. That means even if he is beaten, he will not accept it. He is such a rascal. He is such a rascal. He is being beaten every moment. He is becoming old. He is becoming diseased. He is dying. Still says, "I am not beaten. I am not beaten."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Actually, he still thinks that he's beating death because they put his body in a tomb...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is being beaten every moment, every second, and still, he will say, "I am not beaten." That is rascal number one. One is accepting that "Yes, I am being beaten." He is sane man. And one who says that "I am not beaten," he is getting old, and every moment he is being beaten, and still he says, "I am not beaten."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well they have a philosophy called existentialism, that so long something exists, we can place value on it, but when it ceases to exist, there is no remorse. There is nothing to lament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no nothing to lament, but why don't you exist? Why you struggle for existence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they say if you have money in your hand, as long as you have it you can utilize it, but if you lose it, don't worry. It's nothing to lament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they worry. I have practically seen. They cry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they just fall short of their philosophy, the philosophy they hold as ideal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, these are all no argument. No sane man will accept this argu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Most western people are so frustrated, they accept these philosophies wholeheartedly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is frustration. That is not real life. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But like you say in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they are so angry with all types of speculation that they become frustrated and disgusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Frustration is not life. Frustration is frustration, disappointment. That is not life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say that frustration is the only reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That's for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Absurd, the absurd philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That means they do not know the value of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's it. That means rascaldom. That means rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> One of their chief philosophers, his name was Camus. So after he was propounding this philosophy and writing many books, one night he was driving in his car, and he decided that "There's no meaning, so why not just drive my car off a cliff?" So he just drove his car off a cliff, finished himself off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mad, madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But his books are in colleges especially. Millions and millions of students accept his books as practically gospel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the subject matter of the book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Subject matter of his books, that life is ultimately absurd. There is no real meaning to it. We place our own meanings on it, but those are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are trying... Why you are trying to explain it? Why you are trying to explain it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes, actually he is trying to make reason out of the absurdity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To prove absurd is his reason? That means absurd reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that's what he ultimately realized, that everything is absurd. There is no use speaking, writing or even living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, the thing is that you are saying "absurd," I am saying, "not absurd." Who will settle up this? That is the... If you settle your own affair. I settle my own affair. So who will settle up, whether I am right, you are right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It will be settled at death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś ca.</span> The death is equally acceptable by you and me, but... And it is also a fact you don't want to die; I also don't want to die. Then there is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, but in his case he didn't care. He died willingly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He didn't care, but he always takes care. That is a fact. He always takes care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, but on this instance, he died willingly. He wanted to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But he might be pretending. Might be died, but he was thinking that he'll not (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But he killed himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he did not want to die, but just to keep prestige, he might have died. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I think he wanted to die. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if you want to die, let me kill you immediately. You will be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He wrote another book called <span class="Italic">"Nausea"</span> wherein he wrote how life made him sick to his stomach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means madman. Sometimes madman commits suicide. He's a madman, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Practically, in the last three hundred, or two hundred years, all the most famous writers, and scholars and intellectuals, they all became madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must be, because they do not know what is to be known. Their knowledge is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Nietzsche, Freud, they all died madmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Madman means when one becomes frustrated, he becomes mad. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the people, after them, they think that their lives were very great. They read their books and accept their authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two classes of men. We don't say their life was great. So therefore I say, who will settle? I am right or he is right? Always you will find the madman will say, "I am right." Another man say, "You are not right; I am right." Then who will settle up? That is the point. You will find always these two classes of men. You say you are right, I say I am right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> But by committing suicide, didn't he accept that finally death was the only thing that was not absurd?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, for them the death is the only solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Rascals like such books, Prabhupāda, because it requires no commitment on their part. To read such men-"Oh, yes, that's very nice. I can read them and put them down." But it doesn't require me to trust in God or to do anything for the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Books are written in favor: "If you want to know more about us, then here is book." Because from books, generally, we get knowledge. Otherwise book is not required. Very brilliant light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It's an airplane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if the light is little more brilliant, that means finished. If the same light becomes little more brilliant, that means finished, fall down immediately. It is a big aeroplane? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Several years ago you gave a series of lectures in New York on atonement, that are very famous, and devotees, they relish them very much. <span class="Italic">Prāyaścitta.</span> And this is also in Christian theology to a large extent, plus another concept called feeling very sorry for one's sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Repentant. Repentant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> No so much repentance. It is called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The classic idea is that one goes away and just lives in a state of remorse, solitude and remorse, thinking how sinful and wretched he is, and performing severe austerities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Going away, living in a monastery, performing severe austerities, and always contemplating how sinful and wretched we are and how we must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is suffering. But one who knows that he is suffering, he is intelligent. (Aside): Good morning. Everyone is suffering. If you are not suffering, why you have covered? Why you have covered? Because you are suffering, is it not? Why you are not naked body? Because we are suffering, therefore we have covered. It is a fact. And if somebody says, "No, we are not suffering," then he's a madman. So everyone is suffering. One who knows it, he is intelligent man. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They have no positive philosophy. They stress guilt. They are always guilty. They have no positive philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No... Then the next question is that "If there is a positive philosophy to mitigate the suffering, why don't you accept it?" Just like when one body is suffering, I say, "Take this blanket. Cover." If he says, "No, I am not going to take it," is that sane man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Then he will continue suffering if he doesn't accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Our proposition that everyone is suffering and struggling, how to stop the suffering. This is material world. Everyone is suffering. And the struggle is called progress. So we are offering something also: "Here is something, you accept it, and your sufferings will be mitigated." Nobody can say, "No, we are not suffering." That is insanity. Everyone is suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> This suffering comes from our sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> I shall give you protection from sinful reaction of your life because you are suffering for sinful reaction. Suffering means if you disobey the laws of the state, you suffer. That is sinful. Because you have disobeyed the laws of the state, you are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> If one has difficulty becoming Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is that suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the difficulty, first of all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> You once said if someone is not attracted to chanting, then he is being punished by Yamarāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if you, if by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> you can save your suffering, what is the difficulty, not to accept it? Everyone is suffering in this material world. And everyone is trying to get out of the suffering. That is also a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They try to get out of suffering by committing more sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they do not know how to get out of the suffering. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> ...to tell people who think that they are not suffering that they are actually suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is difficult to teach insane person. That's all. Therefore the best means is, without teaching, "Please come here, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> and takes little <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and go home." Then his insanity will be cured. Then he will be all right. This is our point. We don't sermonize in the beginning. We simply request, "All right, you are very good. Nobody is more intelligent than you. Yes. Please come here, sit down, chant, dance. It is very nice, and takes little <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Go home." That is our program. Then we teach. When he comes to his little sanity, then he will be cured. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, the theologians call contrition. Means an actual thinking about how sinful we are, actually meditating on our sinful condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, simply meditating on sinful condition, that is also good. But what is the counteraction? That we must know. Just like one man is suffering from some disease. He knows that "I have infected this disease." So simply thinking, "Oh, I have been infected by this disease," that is not good. He must go to a physician to cure it. That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Or it's like a criminal. If he commits a crime, it's nice that he laments, but he can't just lament. He has to start working positively.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he must go to the state and offer, "Please kill me." Then state may consider. "I have committed this murder, so the law is: I must give my life. So I am prepared." Then immediately he will be excused. Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> ...a devotee came and told Prabhupāda that he committed some wrong doing, and he was very, very sorry, and he was crying and very sorry, and you said, "That's all right. That's nice. Now do something about it. Engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa's service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes. That is the duty of the physician. If somebody comes, patient: "Sir, I am suffering like this." "All right, don't be sorry. Sit down. I will give you medicine." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...what these rascal philosophers do, psychologists and scientists, they say the things that are very sinful actually, that Kṛṣṇa says and the Bible and all of scriptures say are sinful, they say, "That's all right. You may do those things." Not only do they deny God's existence, but they say that which is sinful is actually good for you: "Yes. You must have intoxication, take illicit sex life," like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No good man will say like that. That is the difference between good man and bad man. The same example as I told, that one blind man is going this side, and another man says, "Yes, you are all right. Go this side." This is going on. Either he does not know, this rascal who says, "Yes, you can go this side," that he will fall down in the ocean and die... Both of them do not know. So one blind man, <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> One blind man is giving direction to another blind man. This is going on. Therefore Vedic injunction is to take direction: "You must go to guru." That is in... <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Gurum eva,</span> "Must go." Then he will get right direction. Otherwise misguided. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> ...there must have been very many gurus. Were there many gurus then?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When? Guru or... First of all, try to understand what is the meaning of guru. Guru means heavy. So one who knows more than you, or one who knows perfectly, that, he is guru. So if you know anything perfectly, then you are guru. But if you do not know anything perfectly, then you are not a guru. You are rascal. So guru means one who knows perfectly. So if you find out somebody, that he knows everything perfectly, then he is guru. That is the first prayer of <span class="Italic">Gurvaṣṭaka. Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam **.</span> Everyone is in the blazing fire of this material existence. It is just like forest fire. Just like if there is fire in the forest, all the inhabitants of forest, all the animals, they become so much in perturbed condition. So guru means to rescue from this forest fire. So therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">ghanāghanatvam.</span> A forest fire can be reduced or can be extinguished... Fire, there must be water. But wherefrom the water will come? Your fire brigade, bucket full of water, will not save. The water must come from cloud. So therefore guru is the cloud. He has taken the mercy from the ocean, or from God, and he pours the mercy. Immediately the fire is extinguished, and you are saved. This is the <span class="Italic">saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanāghanatvam, prāptasya... **.</span> One who has received mercy from the Supreme, he can save. Nobody can save. Your so-called fire brigade bucket or bucket full of water will not save. That is not possible. So as these rascals are simply trying to extinguish the blazing fire of material existence by so-called bucketful of water, it will not save. It will be waste of time. If the cloud comes, then it will be saved. So guru is the cloud. That is... <span class="Italic">Saṁsāra-dāvānala-līḍha-loka-trāṇāya kāruṇya-ghanā... **. Ghanāghanatvam</span> means cloud, dense cloud. As soon as there is dense cloud and pours water, finished, all blazing fire finished. That is guru. And Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura says, <span class="Italic">soṁsāra-biṣānale dibāniśi hiyā jvale:</span> "My heart is burning by the fire of this material existence." <span class="Italic">Juḍāite nā kainu upāya:</span> "I did not make any arrangement for getting out of this fire." <span class="Italic">Golokero prema-dhana, hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana:</span> "Now this <span class="Italic">hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana</span> is coming from Goloka, from the spiritual world. I did not takes care of it." He is lamenting. So this is the fire extinguish instrument. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa in this age, and the fire will be extinguished. [break] <span class="Italic">...prema-dhana hari-nāma-saṅkīrtana, rati nā janmilo kene tāya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">...śaktyāveśa-avatāra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru is the mercy incarnation of God, mercy incarnation. God is kind to everyone, so He is teaching everyone from within, but still, to make it still more explicit, He sends His mercy in the form of guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The <span class="Italic">śaktyāveśa-avatāra</span> means Kṛṣṇa coming in a form of a living entity empowered by him for some special purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Guru is greater than <span class="Italic">śaktyāveśa-avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, guru is considered as Kṛṣṇa Himself. <span class="Italic">Guru-rūpa kṛṣṇa hana avatāra.</span> Just to teach the conditioned soul, guru comes himself, er, Kṛṣṇa comes Himself in the form of guru. Therefore we sing in the Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura's prayer, <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ:</span> "In every <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> guru is accepted as directly Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Sākṣāt. Sākṣāt</span> means directly. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena:</span> As Kṛṣṇa, is accepted in every <span class="Italic">śāstra, sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktaḥ **,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ **,</span> and this statement is accepted by advanced devotees. It is not only statement, but it is accepted. But the next question is: "Does it mean that guru is Kṛṣṇa? Therefore no more Kṛṣṇa wanted?" No. <span class="Italic">Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya:</span> "Guru is exalted because he is very confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa." Here it is clear. Not that he is respected as Kṛṣṇa, therefore he has become Kṛṣṇa. This is Māyāvāda: "He has become Kṛṣṇa." No. <span class="Italic">Kintu:</span> "But don't think that there is no more Kṛṣṇa, finished. Guru is here." Just like the Māyāvādīs say, just like this rascal Guruji, that "I am Kṛṣṇa." Not that. <span class="Italic">Kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya.</span> He is the most confidential servant. <span class="Italic">Vande guroḥ śrī-caraṇāravindam.</span> This is clear explanation. Although he is respected as good as Kṛṣṇa, but he never says that "I am Kṛṣṇa." He says, "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa." And actually he is the most confidential servant of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore we distinguish in this line that <span class="Italic">sevya-bhagavān</span> and <span class="Italic">sevaka-bhagavān:</span> "worshipable God and worshiper God." You follow? God, but worshiper God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Person <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Both of them God, but one God is worshipable, and another God is worshiper. So for the disciple, both of them are worshipable because both of them are God. That is the distinction. <span class="Italic">Sevya-bhagavān, sevaka-bhagavān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Therefore, when we hear the words of guru, we are actually hearing Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is said, <span class="Italic">yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> If you please guru, then Kṛṣṇa is pleased because he is saying the same thing. Just like we are... What we are doing? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are saying that "You just surrender to Kṛṣṇa." We are inventing nothing. Therefore I am guru. Because I am saying Kṛṣṇa's words, not my words, therefore I am guru. As soon as I say my words, then I am not guru. This is the significance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> You are the only one, Śrīla Prabhupāda, who claims to be servant. The rest of them take Kṛṣṇa's position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because they are not guru. They are not guru. That is the difficulty, that one who is not guru, he is taking the place of guru. Therefore people are misguided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> One man who has written a book on these different so-called spiritual movements has remarked that Your Divine Grace is the only one of all... The big difference between our movement and the others is that you claim to be servant, and the others claim to be God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is in a book talking about different spiritual movements in this country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has appreciated this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> He has made that remark. He has noted that difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Therefore I am unique. Yes. Then I can, become unique. Yes. I am not amongst the rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> I tell the students... They ask me how they can distinguish between gurus. I tell them the real guru claims to be servant, and not God. I said only one guru says he is servant. That is Śrīla Prabhupāda. And they can understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Sincere people will appreciate that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> In the early days of this movement, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in New York, devotees said they did not know how to treat Your Divine Grace. They did not know your exalted position. I think we are still very much offensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am servant. I have no exalted position. Servant. Caitanya Mahāprabhu sat down in a place where people were washing their feet. Yes. [break] ...a representative of Kṛṣṇa. I came to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and Kṛṣṇa has sent so many representatives to help me. I consider like that. Without your help I could not do. So I wanted Kṛṣṇa's help, so Kṛṣṇa has sent you. Therefore you are representative of Kṛṣṇa. That is my conception.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Jayādvaita told me that in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it says that. So when the guru says that the disciple is nice, he does not accept.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> No, he was telling me that it was in one <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is very intelligent. Yes. Just like guru does not accept, although he is worshiped like Kṛṣṇa, he never accepts that "I am Kṛṣṇa." That is our <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. <span class="Italic">Śiṣya</span> has to accept guru as Kṛṣṇa, but guru will never accept that he is Kṛṣṇa.

[break] ...says, <span class="Italic">tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ.</span> Where, the place where the devotees are glorifying the Lord, Kṛṣṇa is there. So if Kṛṣṇa is there with the devotees, then wherever devotees are there, that is Vaikuṇṭha. That is Vaikuṇṭha. Just like our temple. It is Vaikuṇṭha. Because the devotees are chanting the glories of the Lord, so that is Vaikuṇṭha. Vaikuṇṭha is not limited. Vaikuṇṭha, as Kṛṣṇa can expand Himself, similarly, Vaikuṇṭha can also be expand, Vṛndāvana can expand. So wherever there is Kṛṣṇa, that is Vai... And where is not Kṛṣṇa?
