<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do they own or lease it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They lease. The city builds it and they lease it from the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the name of this airport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> La Guardia.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They want money. Gargamuni has written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they've been calling for money regularly, but we have not been able to send them any.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I met with Gurukṛpā Swami, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he has just transferred from the Japanese collections 125,000 dollars. He is writing one letter.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For carrying on the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Things are going on here nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're gradually improving. Actually everything has just begun here; it's by no means complete. You'll see that all of the work is just in progress. It will take a while to make it very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Manage nicely. Kṛṣṇa is giving us everything, there is no scarcity. If we simply sincerely work, Kṛṣṇa will give us intelligence, everything. By His mercy everything is available. That is Kṛṣṇa-He can give you anything. That Brooklyn Bridge, I think? That iron bridge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, there is a Brooklyn Bridge, but we're not going over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes I was coming there and sitting down near the bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Near the water? You were sitting near the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a famous bridge, the Brooklyn Bridge. It's the biggest expansion-type bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I was on that Bowery Street, it is not very far away. So I was coming, walking there, and sitting under the bridge. And thinking, "Whether I shall return to India?" (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said you were always inquiring when the boat was returning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was one sub-railway station, beginning with F?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fulton Street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's in the Village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This bridge we're going on is called the Tri-borough Bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. This is over New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it goes over the East River.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Hudson Street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hudson River is on the other side. This is going on the east side of the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That subway that goes to the city office? There are so many bridges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So many, yes, many, many bridges. Every day about seven million people come into this island of Manhattan from the other boroughs, and they go back. From your room, our building is very close to the Empire State Building, so from your room you have a very nice view of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So Los Angeles everything is going nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Everything is very nice. We just had a big <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> marathon for this Fourth of July, and they distributed up to thirty thousand <span class="Italic">Back to Godheads</span> in just a few days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (referring to garland) Make it smaller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it's all one garland, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can just make smaller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We had a good success because we sent out all the householders to the parks. During that holiday everyone goes to the parks. So the householders took their children and they set up a tent, and one of them stayed there babysitting and all the others went out distributing your books. So in that way they went out on traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the name of that boy? He sold one <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> to a chemist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Praghoṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, not Praghoṣa, he's originally from New York, big, heavy, thick-set boy. Begins with J.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One chemist of (indistinct), he sold one book, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> then he talked with me, he's pleased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He sold him a <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> and then he brought him over and Prabhupāda spoke to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New York climate is very nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very nice, like Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> On July Fourth Prabhupāda went and drove into Washington to see the fireworks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In the evening we had traveling <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> all around the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think this is enough, Prabhupāda? I'll tie it together now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana,</span> the reaction was amazing, people were dancing and chanting and waving, Prabhupāda was in ecstasy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> New York climate is very nice. Sometimes now it rains a little bit, then shining. So just like Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I observed that these devotees at New York, they've practically given up sleeping this past week to prepare everything for your arrival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) They are so kind to me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they worked very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It reminded me that time when the Press devotees stayed up all the time to get those <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> volumes. The same spirit. They just stopped eating and sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is love. These things can be done only out of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There were some hired carpenters and painters, and their last day of working was, I think, Wednesday. So yesterday and this morning they came in voluntarily, they stayed up the whole night without sleep, and they continued working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eight o'clock yesterday, and they just finished this morning. Straight through the night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are professional?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara: :</span>Professional, but by the association of the devotees...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says he likes the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you stay here? No rent, you stay here. You are devotee. Stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a celibate right now. He's not married, bachelor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what he wants, and let him give part of his income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because of this rain the atmosphere is actually very clean now. You notice that. It's not very much smog, compared to usual. This is the FDR Drive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are cooperative buildings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. These are lower middle class cooperative buildings. This is the East Side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I selected one cooperative apartment, they wanted five thousand dollars. (laughs) I had no money. Very nice apartment, near city office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Downtown. This is First Avenue here, at about ll6th Street, where we are now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our building is on the Fifty-fourth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty-fifth Street. Just near Broadway, one block from Broadway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Broadway is important place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very important. Our building is right in the midst of the theater, restaurant and entertainment section of the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In New York I feel little homely because first I came here, I was loitering on the street here and there. From 1965 September, to '67 July, continually I stayed in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja gave one class this morning. So he was explaining that we cannot understand the good fortune of this city that you have come here. We cannot begin to estimate how fortunate this city is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I, when I decided I shall go to foreign countries, I never thought of going to London, I thought of coming here. Generally they go to London, but I thought, "No, I shall go to New York."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very progressive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) I do not know. It is Kṛṣṇa's dictation. I could have gone, London was nearer. But I thought, "No I shall go to New York." Sometimes I think I was coming this part. Aimlessly... I think the United Nations building is somewhere here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a little further down. It's on this avenue, it's on Forty-fourth Street, we are on Ninety-sixth Street. We are a little bit uptown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Ninety... Yes. That Indian Consulate office is Sixty-fourth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sixty-fourth Street, and just off Central Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was coming there sometimes, talking with the officers. One Mr. Malotra was there, he was showing me very friendly. He arranged some meeting in consulate office. They had some organization, Tagore Organization. Second Avenue we'll come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This is First Avenue, then comes Second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, sometimes walking on the Second Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're going to go up to Central Park and then go along the Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Ninety-sixth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Ninety-sixth Street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was fire in this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There are many fires in this city, I notice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is due to the warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, due to the warm, and also the buildings, some of them are old and they are not built properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not taken care of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Our building is also an old building, it's seventy years old. But it's made of solid stone and concrete, brick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it will never get old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's extremely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to simply change the plastering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, painting, plastering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it will continue new for hundreds of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's built like that, it's all steel reinforced everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, then it is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's rated..., it has the top fire rating in the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After three years it will require little repairing, then it will keep new always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right now we're in the process of simply repainting it, giving it a fresh coat of paint to make it new, because they had not painted it for about ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It should be painted every three years, then it will be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On the outside as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything, then the building will keep very fresh always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Second Avenue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think Third Avenue. Next comes Lexington Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is black area?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Puerto Rican and black. This city has as many people Puerto Ricans as Puerto Rico does. So many Puerto Rican people come here, because part of it's a possession of the United States. So the East Side is Puerto Ricans and the West Side...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally they are worker class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. This is Park Avenue.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They speak Spanish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Puerto Ricans speak Spanish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you sell Spanish books to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We do. We distribute here Spanish books from New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Today Hṛdayānanda Mahārāja is sending to the printer the last volume of the First Canto in Spanish, another volume of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in Spanish. And before you leave New York he will give you...</div>

And on Sundays we put on <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> in the park, and then people are invited to come to the temple for the feast. Now because of the good weather, many people leave the city on the weekend, so the numbers of people who are coming on the Love Feast days is not as much as before the summer and after the summer. Now they like to go to the beaches and resort areas, where it's cool and there's water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The zoo is here also here? (pronounces "joo")</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he and I stay together. We get up at two-thirty in the morning, chant sixteen rounds before <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> saying <span class="Italic">Gāyatrī</span> strictly on time, eating very little, and he reads a great deal of the day, two or three hours he reads, and he's also preaching, giving classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> She's engaged in taking care of the life members, Indian life members who come, and the guest rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. She is expert. She's very expert. She can do nicely. During winter here it will be so cold you cannot stand even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually after I left Hawaii, I went to see you in Hawaii, all of the work that we did in this building began from when I returned here. So it's been a great push for the last month or month and a half, I think. They did not do much improvement on the temple the first five or six months they were here. They were just adjusting, I guess.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not proper leader. What is this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Metropolitan Museum of Art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Metropolitan Museum of Art. Very famous art museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Saw fireworks in Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's the Empire State Building, Prabhupāda, straight ahead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think one day our art paintings will also be in these museums. Because our artists are becoming as expert as anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Must be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Already people are coming and offering minimum one thousand dollars to buy a painting. In Los Angeles, I have sold some paintings for a thousand dollars each. Originals and some copies (laughter) also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Copy, how do you make copy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have some artists practicing. So he makes a copy of the original, and I sell it for five hundred dollars. Half the price of the original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But that will increase. You can get ten thousand, twenty thousand dollars for one painting in the future, because they are paying that much now for inferior work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is painting nice? Muralī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Muralīdhara, Jadurāṇī, Parīkṣit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Parīkṣit is wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Parīkṣit, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He's expert. We have one boy in the temple here who has been doing murals on the walls in the temple room, and he's done it very quickly with a technique called air-brush. Instead of using a brush, you use a spray gun, and you spray the paint on. It's a modern technique. It's especially good in murals and things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all they draw in lines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And then they spray on the paint. He finishes a painting in two or three days. Big murals. (laughs) He's expert. He's known as the human camera. He can copy any picture onto a wall. His name is Viṣṇu dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why does he not go to Māyāpura-candrodaya...? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he's meant to go, after he finishes the temple. You already told him to go last time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We knew you would say that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We were talking this morning how as soon as you see these murals, you'll say he should go to Māyāpura. He paints very quickly. We could actually send him with that spray gun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Electric spray?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I don't know if they use electricity, or do you use gas? The thing is that he can paint directly, just as fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, I had him in L.A. painting by brush.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't recognize it. Oh, the Fritt Collection, it's an art museum. This whole street is full of art museums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's one gentleman named Fritt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This taxi driver is saying Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Jayānanda was driving taxi and chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, and one day (laughter) he brought to me five thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And you used it to print <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Was that the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You kept it then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was given for publishing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but I think Macmillan took it. So I spent it for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then you put him in charge to sell all the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya,</span> I remember. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayānanda:</span> (indistinct) Didn't sell too many books, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I thought he was the best, most appropriate person to drive you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was chanting and driving. Very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cyavana has been here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just train him, he is good boy. He has fallen down, just take care of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, actually the work here needs, you'll see, this building, it actually requires four or five big leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One may fall down, but you have to take care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's much better now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he'll do, he's good worker, if you can train him, he's a good worker. He can do very nice. He has fallen in <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> just take care of him, what can be done? He's good worker, very good worker. He can do intelligent service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very intelligent, very high-class, nice devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows accounting. There was no guide, he became alone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's exactly what he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and became spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said there was just too much for himself alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the difficulty. As soon as there is lack of good association, one falls a victim. What about that boy, Ṛṣi Kumāra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, he's doing great. He's taken up joint charge of the restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also very good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All day long he cooks, and after he cooks, then the people take the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in the restaurant, he goes out and preaches to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's an able worker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then he goes out and leads the <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span> party on the street. He's very enthusiastic to make this restaurant very successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But keep watch on him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For the women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He gets deluded. Well, you know what we've done with all of these people, Prabhupāda, we've...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are disturbed, let them marry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He doesn't want, he says he knows it's a waste of time, marriage. What we have done with Ṛṣi Kumāra and Bali-mardana is we are living with them. Like Ṛṣi Kumāra lives with Ādi-keśava Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody must be with him. Then it is all right. Not alone. Either Cyavana or him, some experienced devotee must be with him. Then they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I think Ṛṣi Kumāra is a good cook also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> My personal opinion is he's the best cook that I've so far seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Since he has come here the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> in the restaurant has at least doubled in the quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Completely different <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> He's learned the Gujarati style. <span class="Italic">Kacuris, samosā,</span> every kind of special prep. When we stayed in Kailasa Shiksarya's house when we were first in Bombay, the things that those cooks were cooking, he knows how to cook. Very high class Marwari and Gujarati cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And Maṇibandha, he's another one, he's cooking with Ṛṣi Kumāra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's also very intelligent boy, but sometimes spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have a lot of them here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, we have to take care of so many souls. (<span class="Italic">Karmī</span> yells) What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He said you have a nice car. That's good they like the car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Ask why him don't you come here? (laughter) Why you are driving taxi? Come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's amazing how everybody is looking at us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, formerly it was thirty-five, now it is</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">sixty-five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda. Everything has doubled in price. This car is very ordinary, but it is because you are in it, Prabhupāda, that they are looking. Ordinarily it is not such a special car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the make of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> LTD. What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's the same, more or less the same car that you had when you were driving in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The same as what you had in Melbourne also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's a Ford.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Los Angeles this was Mercedes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Mercury. Right? Mercury?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is nice car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It's their version of Cadillac, Mercury's version of Cadillac. They cannot understand because we say we are not after material opulence for ourselves, they cannot understand that we drive in these cars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think that we unnecessarily criticize. But we require everything. But just like a man. When he's alive his decoration, his nice dress, everything is very good. But if he's dead, then it is useless. Similarly, without spiritual consciousness we are dead. Because the body is dead. Because the spirit soul is there, therefore it is moving. The important point is the spirit soul. So if you are simply taking care of the body very nicely, that means you are decorating the dead body. What is the value of it? It is clear? The body is important because the soul is there. So long the life is there, if you decorate the body everyone will appreciate. But if you decorate the dead body, people will say "What a fool he is!" <span class="Italic">Aprāṇasya hi dehasya maṇḍanaṁ loka-rañjanam.</span> That is simply a popular applause, "Ah, the dead body is decorated," but what is the value of it? Similarly, without spiritual knowledge, this dead civilization simply on the bodily concept of life, it is ludicrous. That we have to condemn. Take Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then everything is... Just like one, if there is zero, then it is ten. Another zero, hundred. But without one, simply zero; it is only useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That one is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And Kṛṣṇa's representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One, if there is one, then zero has value. If there is no one, then simply increasing zeroes, what do we get for that? That is the position. There is no spiritual understanding, they are simply after material advancement. Therefore despite all advancement materially, they are not happy. You cannot, now they are trying to bring life by material combination. It is all impossible, childish. Our scientists, they have come, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, Sadāpūta, yes, they are all here, aren't they?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mādhava and Svarūpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Three of them, Mādhava, Svarūpa and Sadāpūta also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Ever since we published that article that they wrote in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> many people have been impressed that "Oh, Ph.D's they are accepting this movement." Many Indian guests in Los Angeles, they all comment that they have read this article, and now they are taking our movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I have collected one Indian, four items he is Ph.D. He is Ph.D. in chemistry, Ph.D. in engineering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Dr. Sharma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And Ph.D. in pathology. Four, and he's lawyer also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is he going to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's going to help our, this... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These are bookstalls, look at that. Barnes and Nobles, they are putting up bookstalls here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Another Ph.D. from India has joined our movement in Denver. He just moved into the temple, he has a Ph.D. in psychology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are horse carriages here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just there. (Plaza Hotel?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is Fifty-seventh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty-ninth. They don't want to turn here, huh, Jayānanda? Do you? Go up Fifty-ninth it would be nicer. This is where the parade begins. From here down straight. All the way down Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. From here all the way down, we go all the way down to the park. Washington Square Park. All the way down, three <span class="Italic">rathas.</span> It's the biggest avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any hour limit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Two or three hours it will take. You've got to get on the right side, Jayānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It appears more congested than before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, business is increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Population are increased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had a festival to celebrate the Fourth of July in the Battery, down at Battery Park. Four million people attended. We sold <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> there, over one thousand dollars of <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> (laughs) was sold from our <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. They were selling <span class="Italic">kacuris,</span> sandwiches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This Doubleday Company, they take our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm not sure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I don't know. Generally the bookstores, they don't take our books because our distributors are distributing on the street in front of the bookstore, they say it is competition. But the college bookstores, they all take our books. We just got a report from Satsvarūpa Mahārāja that this past month of June in America they sold seventy-five standing orders. And that is remarkable, because all the schools are closed in June, and still they sold them books. They closed for the summer, and still they are ordering your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this street I think there is one library office...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's Fifty..., it's either Fifty-fifth or Fifty-third, and it's called, it's one of main sub-branches. Yes, it's a very well known one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Free rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Free rent. Rent a safe deposit box for one year and we'll give you an extra six months free." But first you have to pay for one year. Chemical Bank. Huge buildings now everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Rockefeller?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda, now everything looks like the Rockefeller Plaza. All of the buildings are built in that same style. Very opulent. Now every day I look out the window of our building and I think when it will come that we will have one of these buildings. It won't be long. You can see how big these are, Prabhupāda. This is Sixth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are between Sixth Avenue and?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we're between Eighth Avenue and Ninth. Actually our building can be seen from here. Hare Kṛṣṇa is on the outside of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I can see it just on the left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Straight ahead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's on the left straight ahead. It's a brown building on the left side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a tree on the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has gold letters going down the side of it saying Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's the brownish one with the white, little white cabin-type thing on the top of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're very lucky, we rented a garage one block away which can house four buses and twenty vans. Only one block away from it, its very unusual. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have taken the whole garage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, otherwise it's not possible to get parking space in New York. See the "Hare Kṛṣṇa" now, Prabhupāda, on the side of the building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayānanda, maybe you should park on the right side. We can walk across the street rather than getting out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pull over if you can on the right side, then Prabhupāda can see the building from across the street. [break] Yes, at least for the next five or ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Then you'll have to change again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then we want the Empire State Building. (laughter) We have a nice banner which flies in front of the building also. I think you should park on the right side, Jayānanda, unless... All right, park on the left. See the banner?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
