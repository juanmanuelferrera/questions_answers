<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...it will be constituted, that. Their business will be to exploit the poor citizens. And they will be embarrassed and harassed so much: by one side, no sufficient rain, and therefore scarcity of food, and the other side, taxation by the government. In this way, the people will be so much harassed that they'll give up their home and go to the forest. Very piti... Unless they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll not be saved. The <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college has to be established immediately. Everywhere, wherever we have got our center, a <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college should be established to train four divisions: one class, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa;</span> one class, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya;</span> one class, <span class="Italic">vaiśya;</span> and one class, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> But everyone will be elevated to the spiritual platform by the spiritual activities which we have prescribed. There is no inconvenience, even for the <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passerby:</span> <span class="Italic">Jayo!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Are <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> supposed to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdras...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they should not be allowed to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Only those who are qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they'll be allowed to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas</span> used to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas...</span> Some of them. Not all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> but they left home. There is no need of accepting <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> One has to perform the devotional activities. That is real thing. Simply by changing dress, one does not improve. Unless he takes to the, seriously, principles of devotional service. But in the Kali-yuga, they'll think, "Because I have changed my dress, I have become a big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" You see? "Because I have got a sacred thread, now I am a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" No. There must be regular training. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in a <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> society is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> In a <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> society, are most of the citizens <span class="Italic">śūdras?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Are the majority of citizens <span class="Italic">śūdras?</span> In a <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> society?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The number of <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> are always bigger. Just like in University education. The, the number of graduates and post-graduates, they're less. Others are big, number bigger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The whole idea is that at the end of everyone's life, everyone is required to leave home, perform devotional activities, but not necessarily take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotional activities, either he leaves from home or not leaves, that doesn't matter. It must continue from the very beginning. For the management of affairs, we require to divide. Because there are different classes of brain, so those who have very intellectual brain, they should become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Those who are fit for management and protection, they should be trained as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And those who are fit for producing food, taking care of the cows, they should be trained as <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> And the balance, they're all <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> This is the division. You... Everywhere you'll find this division, natural. One class of men, very intelligent. One class of men, very strong, good brain for management, administration. (aside) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> One class of men, fit for tilling the ground, field, and produce food, take care of the cows. And the balance, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> That's all. So in our society, this division should be there. The most intelligent class of men, they should be engaged in preaching, reading books and instructing, taking care of Deity worship, temple, and another class should be strong managers, that things are going on nicely. Everyone is engaged, not that eating and sleeping. Everyone must be engaged, employed. So, so if one is very much adapted for eating and sleeping, he should be engaged with plows. You see. He must be activity. Otherwise, there must be dysentery, eating and sleeping. He cannot digest. Yes. So in this way, our society should be managed. Not that "Give me second initiation, a sacred thread." And after getting it, business finished: "Now I'm liberated. Let me eat and sleep." This should be stopped. We have got fifty <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land, and I have calculated in Māyāpura, setting aside twenty <span class="Italic">bighās</span> for the temple and grazing ground for the cows, thirty <span class="Italic">bighās</span> of land. The production should be three hundred mounds of grains. And three hundred mounds of grain, I have calculated. How much you can...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Fifteen hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. According to our present calculated, about 180 mounds. So there should be 120 mounds excess of grain. Instead of excess, they want ten thousand rupees for maintenance. This is... This management is going on. These things were not discussed in GBC? So what kind of discussion was there? Simply talking? No practical? And the estimate of budget was presented for ten thousand rupees per month. And... And when it was scrutinizingly studied, immediately it came down to six thousand. So what kind of budget? So management should be in that way, that nobody is sitting idly. Automatically he'll fall sick. Sickness means idleness. Or excess eating, sleeping. No excess, no less. <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihārasya yogo bhavati duḥkha-hā. Yukta. Yukta</span> means actually what you need. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So everywhere, in each center, this system should be introduced, and there must be practical application of the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> At the same time, this program of devotional service. Then it will go on very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Should devotees be formally designated in a particular occupation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No. Devotees are devotees. Actually devotees are above this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> But for management of material things, we have to divide. Just like in the body there are divisions. There are... Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa was acting as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> In His boyhood, He was acting like a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> But Kṛṣṇa is neither <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> nor, nor <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This is the example. He was a cowherd boy. That is business of <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> And when He was fighting in the battlefield, He was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> He was marrying as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So although He was acting sometimes as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> sometimes as <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> but He's neither of these. So devotee is like that. He may act in any position, but He is above all the material conception of life. That is perfection. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> What should the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> be taught?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas</span> should be taught that he is manager. He must see that everyone is engaged. And if there is any fight, they must come forward to fight. This is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> business. There may be fight. Somebody may attack us. Not that chanting, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa..." No. They must come forward. "Yes, we are prepared to fight." That is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla-Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla-Kṛṣṇa:</span> In our centers we are awarding <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> initiation, second initiation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Initiation should go on. Even... You do not understand what I have said, that that is for Vaiṣṇava. A Vaiṣṇava and Viṣṇu... Just like Kṛṣṇa is Viṣṇu, He's not human being, but He was acting like human being, similarly, Vaiṣṇava is transcendental. But for proper management of the material world, one should be acting like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> one should be acting like <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> That is required. Just like actually we are doing so. Some of you are preaching, and some of you are cleansing the temple. It does not mean that a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> who is preaching, he is better than that man who is cleansing. The... Their position as Vaiṣṇava is the same. But for the management, one is cleansing, one is seeing the construction, one is going to preach, like that. That should be there. It is not that "Because I have taken <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> therefore I cannot any more do anything." If need be, he has to act as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Or a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Doesn't matter. But manage, for management, this division must be there. Otherwise it will be mismanagement. Yes. A Vaiṣṇava coming to the position of doing the work of a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> does not mean he has become <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He's Vaiṣṇava. Try to understand this point. Just like in the stage. If you want to play something, one must be king, one must be queen, one must be..., but neither of them king or queen. That is stage play. Similarly to manage things in the material world we have to... <span class="Italic">Guṇa, karma.</span> <span class="Italic">Karma</span> there must be. Therefore the <span class="Italic">karma</span> should be done, executed, according to quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya-ṛṣi:</span> So in our Movement, the leaders must decide how every devotee and every resource is engaged properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is leadership. That is leadership. The... Which man is fitted for which work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya-ṛṣi:</span> Yes. Utilization of all resources...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya-ṛṣi:</span> ...including devotees and funds and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then... The first thing is that we should see that everyone is engaged. How he should be engaged, that requires leadership. But the first business is to engage everyone. Nobody should be without engagement. Then it will be idle worse, works... What do you call? Idle brain is devil's workshop. And the devil is <span class="Italic">kāminī-kāñcana,</span> woman and money. This is devil. So if you remain idle, then you shall think of devil. So we should see that everyone is engaged properly. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...instruction in this connection is very important. Everyone should be trained as Vaiṣṇava. At the same time, he should work in different position for management. So if our men are not prepared-Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Mahārāja-for doing the plowing work, then what is the use of purchasing land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are not prepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are not prepared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? You have to engage laborer and spend two hundred rupees per head at least, including salary and food, and the production is nil. In this way, there must be ten thousand, twenty thousand expenditure. Am I right or not, that "You bring money some way from anywhere, and let us spend lavishly?" What kind of management this is? We should consider the money, after all, is earned with hard labor. So somebody will bring money with hard labor, and another body will spend like irresponsible prince; that should be stopped. That is management. [break] ...especially is that the religion means to make a class of men, simply idle... What is? Opiate...? What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Opiate of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are against religion. But actually, if we show that we are producing, we are managing, we are educating, then we can counteract the communist tendency. But they are seeing that, that escaping. They say, "They escape responsibility of worldly life and they're indulging in some religious..." That is the tendency. All... Everywhere the government is complaining like that. Therefore they do not want to increase the number of temples, increase the number of devotees. They do not want. Because they say, "These are a class of idle men. They cannot do anything, and they take to this religious life." That is the tendency. They are feeling like that. But if you show that you are actually doing something ideal, then they will appreciate. Make a small unit of community and show ideal life, not idle life. Ideal life. Then this mis... That... Now in Bombay, they have refused. Because they are under the impression that "They, these Europeans have come here under some sentiment, and what is the use?" They have taken some plea and rejected our... [break] ...is there. As we are making counterpropaganda against <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is also very strong. She will also make propaganda against you, very strong. So unless you become very sincere devotee, <span class="Italic">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">,</span> then it will not be possible to conquer over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You'll be succumbed. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">...taranti te, mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> In India the, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> class, they say, "Oh, I am born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. Why shall I do this work?" You see. Therefore the whole society has gone to hell. In your country still, they accept any kind of work. It doesn't matter. And here, in India, if he happens to be a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he'll not take any kind of work. Means... Just like plowing. He'll not agree. Therefore so much land. The <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> is thinking, "I am <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span>" The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is thinking, "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" And the land is lying fallow. There is no production. He will go to the office and fight with the pen as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> And instead of studying <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> he'll study the rules and regulations given by the office. But he'll not come to plow. Therefore this scarcity of food. He'll go to a mill to work as ordinary laborer. (Hindi) He'll not come. So much land we see lying unutilized. And they're crying for grain. Why? The same example. I was writing that in New York City, the whole city is full of dirty things, garbage, for want of cleaners, and you go to the Central Park, you'll find so many hippies are lying down idle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya-ṛṣi:</span> Unemployment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: </span>Not employment. They'll not work. That means mismanagement. Why they should remain down? Why they should remain without any employment? But the government is not doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They do not feel inspired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They do not feel inspired. No one has desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that means mismanagement. You had no desire to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but you have been taken to it by some, some way or other. That is management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You are expert manager.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A child does not want to go to school, but it is the duty of the parent to send him to the school by some way or other. So that is government's duty, that a man should be employed according to his capacity. There should be no unemployment. That is very dangerous position of the society. Now this unemployment question is very strong all over the world. They'll plan that "This government is not good. That system is not good. He's not good." And he'll do nothing. He'll personally do nothing. Just like the hippies, they criticize everyone, but he'll not do anything. It is all... These descriptions are there in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> We are going too far? Employed... [break] ...from the government to utilize this land. You see? So much. Everywhere you'll find. Everywhere you'll find. Who was with me in London?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. Last time, last summer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Letchmore Heath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much, lying vacant. They have taken it into consideration that "What is the use of working in the land? Better kill one animal and eat easily." Because he doesn't care for sinful activities. The... "If I can eat the cow, why shall I take so much trouble to till the...?" This is going on, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Employment means now just to cut the money and not to work. No work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] The same... Employment, even for the woman, the <span class="Italic">carakā.</span> You see? Gandhi also studied this. There must be... Woman should be engaged for weaving. What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Spinning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spinning, yes. Everyone should be engaged. That is management. So all GBC members must see that in every temple, everyone is engaged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That is the meaning of leadership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the meaning of leadership.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And that all the devotees are protected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And all the devotees are protected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone should be engaged. And if everyone is engaged, he'll never fall sick. Yes. [break] ...the farmers, their son, they're giving up the farming business.</div>
