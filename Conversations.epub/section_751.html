<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose if you come from other side and you land on Arabian desert, does it mean that you have gone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> They have gone on earth, some other part of the place...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I say they have not gone to moon, that is my point. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have become "moonies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The might have gone to some hell, that is, I have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Or the moon or anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? (laughing) This is a little revolting (revolutionary). But I am speaking from the very beginning. Yes, I wrote that <span class="Italic">Easy Journey to Other Planets</span> in 1958, and you'll find this statement in my book. It is all childish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have to be yogi for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am yogi because I am taking lessons from the yogis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoga dhāraṇā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yogi, I am taking lesson from Śukadeva Gosvāmī. I may be fool, but I am taking lesson from the yogi. Yes. So <span class="Italic">yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtir [Bg. </span>18.78]<span class="Italic">.</span> I don't require to be a yogi. I take shelter of the <span class="Italic">yogeśvara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoginām api sarveṣāṁ mad-gatenāntarātmanā [Bg. </span>6.47]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, my problem, there is no problem, because as soon as there is Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">śrīr, vibhūtir,</span> victory, everything is there. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So we have got everything, but I am not a yogi. We must believe in the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ yatra dhanur-dharaḥ pārthaḥ tatra śrīr vibhūtir vijayo.</span> Everything is there. That art we have to learn, that let us become dependent like Arjuna on Kṛṣṇa, then everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇaḥ sarva-bhūtanāṁ </span><i class="calibre3">hṛd-deśe<span class="Italic"></span></i> 'rjuna tiṣṭhati.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and He teaches also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You consult Kṛṣṇa within before you do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but Kṛṣṇa is not so foolish that He will give consultation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He'll give consultation free of charge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to the nondevotees. Arjuna was a devotee. That <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīthi-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is constantly engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service, to him He gives intelligence, not to the rascals. Kṛṣṇa is there, but-even in the heart of the pig or dog-but He does not give any instruction to the pig and dog. They must suffer. But only to the devotees: <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam.</span> To them. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is staying everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> To them He gives <span class="Italic">yoga-kṣemam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is open to even cats and dog. You'll get your food. They're getting their food. That is not very difficult thing. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ yo vidadhāti kāmān.</span> Kṛṣṇa is..., Kṛṣṇa, He can, ah, <span class="Italic">bhū-bhṛt, bhūta-bhṛt.</span> His name is <span class="Italic">bhūta-bhṛt.</span> He is maintaining everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūta-bhṛt, bhūtastho.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhūta-bhṛt</span> means (Hindi). All living entities are being...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But He is <span class="Italic">bhūtastho</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also, but another name is <span class="Italic">bhūta-bhṛt.</span> He maintains all living entities. So that is not a very difficult job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But sir, I want to ask a question. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> He says, "I am in them, and I am not in them also." That means, sir, both His, all the beings are in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, "not in them" for the understanding of these rascals whose takes it that because Nārāyaṇa is everyone, heart, then everyone is Nārāyaṇa, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not <span class="Italic">daridra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or to warn these rascals, He says, "I am not there. I am not there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is not like that, that He is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he is a foolish man, if you say "Because Nārāyaṇa is there, everyone is Nārāyaṇa," he will misunderstand. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "No, I am not there." <span class="Italic">Na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ.</span> This is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Would it not be considered like this, sir, that He is in the Golok as well as here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Goloka, position of, <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty akhilātmā-bhūto [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">,</span> that is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Akhilātmā-bhūto.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But don't take that because <span class="Italic">akhilātmā bhūto,</span> Nārāyaṇa is in the dog, therefore I have to worship dog. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> And why not <span class="Italic">dhanī-nārāyaṇa</span>? What is the.... This foolishness is going on. And Nārāyaṇa is everywhere. If you have such a, I mean to say, advanced vision, that Nārāyaṇa is everywhere-that is also mentioned; therefore you should keep respect-then why do you make discrimination, that only <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa</span>? Why not <span class="Italic">dhanī-nārāyaṇa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Last time you gave the example of the curd and the milk. That was very good example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why the..., not <span class="Italic">dhanī-nārāyaṇa</span>? Or the dog Nārāyaṇa or the goat Nārāyaṇa? Goat Nārāyaṇa cut his throat; fish Nārāyaṇa cut his throat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmavat sarva-bhūteṣu,</span> sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals are going on. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "I am not there, <span class="Italic">nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ,"</span> to teach these rascals. Otherwise, they'll misunder...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Does it not mean, sir, that <span class="Italic">nāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ,</span> "I am staying in Goloka"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He says, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam [Bg. </span>9.4]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I am everywhere, but still I am not there." Because these rascals will misunderstand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It seems ambiguous to understand, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not ambiguous. It requires knowledge from the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So we have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you manufacture your own knowledge, then you'll never be able to understand. (everyone laughs) <span class="Italic">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] compulsory. You cannot understand; that is not possible. My Guru Mahārāja used to say that the honey, huh? Honey, honey, if somebody says, "Take this honey," the bottle, and he began to lick up the bottle: "It is not sweet. Why it is not sweet?" You go to a person who can open the bottle. (laughter) Then you'll see. You cannot taste the sweetness of honey by licking up the bottle. It must be... There must be some expert who can open it, and then you can taste. So they are trying to taste the honey in the bottle by their own imagination and licking up the bottle. Where is the taste? Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">One who has seen, one who knows where is the honey is there, go there, and he'll open, and you'll understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So "I am not there for the rascals, and I am there for you," like that, is that the meaning you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "I am not there for the rascals, and I am there for those who are <span class="Italic">tattva-darśanas.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the way of learning everything. You cannot learn your medical science from a <span class="Italic">pān-wālā.</span> You have to go to a medical college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They also give some (gowdies?) in the <span class="Italic">pān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot take your degree from the <span class="Italic">pān wālā.</span> Nowadays some of the rascals, they are preaching openly that you haven't got to go to a guru. Huh, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Krishnamurti is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this rascal was speaking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He has thousands of disciples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such kind of.... as he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Nehi, kṛṣṇaṁ vande jagat-gurum.</span> He is a <span class="Italic">jagat-guru,</span> if you approach Him also, there is no, I mean physical guru nearby, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇaṁ jagat-gurum, kṛṣṇaṁ vande jagat-gurum.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is <span class="Italic">jagat-guru...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...you have to go to Kṛṣṇa not directly: <span class="Italic">yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> You have to go through the devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">ādau śraddhā.</span> If you have got faith in Kṛṣṇa, then next stage is <span class="Italic">tato sādhu-saṇgaḥ.</span> And who is <span class="Italic">sādhu</span>? <span class="Italic">Bhajate mām ananya-bhāk sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you want to see Kṛṣṇa, you have to see first of all His devotee. <span class="Italic">Māṁ bhaktyā pūjā bhudhikaḥ.</span> This is also.... "If you worship My devotee, that is better worship than worshiping Me directly." Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> He doesn't say by <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-kṛpā,</span> he says <span class="Italic">guru-krpā,</span> first. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurur brahma, gurur viṣṇuḥ,</span> they say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śravanānanda:</span> Some life members (indistinct).... completely ridiculous. They were worshiping everything as God, so in every temple they go in they would pay their obeisances, and if there is some tree, they will pay their obeisances, if there is some stone or brick, and is covered with <span class="Italic">kuṁkuma</span> and turmeric, they would also pay their obeisances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what is the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Your answer is all right. <span class="Italic">Gurur brahma gurur viṣṇuḥ.</span> So I mean that is the philosophy of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sākṣād-haritvena samasta-śāstrair<br class="calibre2"/>yuktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya<br class="calibre2"/>vande guroḥ śrī caraṇāravindam</div>
<div class="Purp-para">In every <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> you'll find, just like you say, <span class="Italic">gurur brahma gurur viṣṇuḥ.</span> In other words, <span class="Italic">sākṣād-haritvena,</span> directly Hari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-hari.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-haritvena samasta-śāstrair.</span> Not that in a particular.... In all the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And <span class="Italic">sākṣād-haritvena samasta-śāstrair yukta,</span> "It is said," <span class="Italic">tathā, bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ,</span> "and this is accepted by all authorities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sadbhiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Sadbhiḥ.</span> Not <span class="Italic">asadbhiḥ. Asadhbhī</span> says "No, no. I don't require a guru. You make me guru." If I don't require a guru, then why you rascal you are speaking this? You are teaching, why you are teaching me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Last night's question on that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you don't require a guru, then why you are teaching me, if you don't require a guru? Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (to passerby) These people, they say like that. You don't require guru. You don't require a book to study; everything you'll get, within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is one of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are writing book? Everything is within. All right, but why you are writing book to convince? And why you are teaching them there is no need of guru? That means you want to be guru. All other gurus useless. Just see!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They, they'll say that their mind is a part of the <span class="Italic">samasti</span> mind, and you ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, I require your help to understand it. Therefore you become my guru. If I require your help to understand something, that is guru. And you say there is no need of guru. Then why you are taking trouble, to teach me this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If.. guru is necessity right from the birth, the first guru is the mother...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these rascals they preach like that: there is no need of guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think they are wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore rascals simply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are rascals, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply rascals. Rascals means he does not know the thing, and he still preaches. Therefore rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is how that Bhagavān has made so many gurus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A guru.... Guru must be there. There are many they say like that-"There is no need of guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But do you have to make an effort to get a, to achieve a <span class="Italic">sad-guru</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. Praṇipāta</span> means you have to surrender there. So you are not a fool. When you submit somewhere, you must test, and then submit. That is <span class="Italic">sad-guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They say, sir, that if you are very sincere, then the <span class="Italic">sad-guru</span> comes automatically to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> As you have come to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because Kṛṣṇa is there, if He sees somebody is actually serious to understand Him-just like Dhruva Mahārāja. Dhruva Mahārāja, did not..., he did not make any guru, but with fervent desire he went, "Yes, I shall find out Kṛṣṇa." Mother said "Kṛṣṇa can be found in the forest," so he went to the forest, and he began according to his own way. Then Kṛṣṇa sent Nārada Muni, that "This boy is very serious. Go and give him real <span class="Italic">mantra.</span>" That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]. Two things required: guru and Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja. Mālī hañā kare sei bīja koro āropana.</span> "I have got some seed of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> and I keep it in the iron chest." No. You must make cultivation of <span class="Italic">bhakti-bīja: mali hañā sei bia koro āropana.</span> And how to nourish the <span class="Italic">bīja? Śravaṇa-kīrtana-jale karaye śecana:</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.152] by <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam.</span> Water is this. Then <span class="Italic">bhakti-latā</span> will come out a tree, and you will get the fruits and enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Smaraṇam kīrtanam.... pada pūjānam.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtanam, arcanam, vandanam, dāsyam...</span></div>
