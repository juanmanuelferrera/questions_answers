<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everyone is infected with this "Life comes from chemicals." That I was talking to the air hostess on the plane coming, and she said, "But life comes from chemicals." This is the way everybody's taught in the schools, they don't know any different and they don't think about it, they have no intelligence to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And as soon as we say that you take an egg and find out the chemicals and put it into the incubator or under a chicken, get life, "No, wait millions of years." This bluffing. And this moon planet going means Arizona. That is now disclosed. They take photographs in the Arizona. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take photographs where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Arizona. There's an article, and it showed a picture of Mars and it compared, there's supposed to be this canyon four miles deep. So they said it compares to the Grand Canyon in Arizona, like that. So Prabhupāda said that by even mentioning Arizona they've revealed themselves. And he told one story about, there's a man, he heard a noise in his room, and he said, "Ah, who is that?" And immediately the reply came, "Oh, I'm not stealing." So even without asking, they've revealed themselves by saying Arizona, even mentioning Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why these rascals compare it with Arizona? As if there is no other place in the world. Everything they are doing in Arizona. All photograph in this place. Now they have been caught. I was always protesting, "These rascals have never gone." For the last ten years I've protested. Whenever they asked me, I say straightly, "It is all childish. They have never gone, neither they'll be able to go." That has been proof available. Now they do not talk about it. That is finished, all propaganda, finished. Now they have taken another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...to keep their service in order. This is going on, all cheating. To keep people in darkness and exploit them. The so-called swamis exploiting, yogis exploiting, politician exploiting, scientists exploiting, philosophers exploiting. What is the position of the world? And this is the opportunity, human life, to know everything, to solve all the problems. They are not given the opportunity, they are kept in darkness. The demons. "There is no God, science is everything, life is produced from chemicals, and there is no living entities on other planets." They are simply show. This planet is full of..., it is all scientists, and they are vacant. And we have to believe that. Perhaps for the first time I am raising protest against all this nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is such a challenge. Your statements are such a challenge to their so-called science that they're still in shock. I still think that they do not take us seriously yet because it's such a difference to what they are saying. Soon, gradually, they'll take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have engaged these scientists. They are going to publish one paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa-vijñānam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's the name of the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And other scientists have joined. Scientist in four subject matters, an Indian gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think he's here now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's here? He has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What's his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sharma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, no. Different one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This one has four Ph.D.s.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got some international name. So he says that "It's great fortune I have met you." He's now realizing his mistakes. He has still some respect for Vivekananda; that I did not disturb; he might misunderstand. Actually this Vivekananda rascal, what he has done? What is his contribution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You always add on "rascal" whenever you mention his name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, what he has done? He has ruined the Vedic culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Completely misrepresented it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the Bon Mahārāja is his follower. He's in name a disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī, but he's a servant of Vivekananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's very similar to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a great appreciator of Vivekananda. He has put in his curriculum Vivekananda philosophy, Gandhi philosophy. Rascal, what philosophy they have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He mentioned all the nonsense people. He put a circular out, he mentioned Rama Tirtha, Vivekananda, all these nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I am convinced he's a rascal. He's nothing but a great rascal. My Guru Mahārāja rejected him. Therefore he was called back, rascal, he used to say like that, <span class="Italic">banamānuṣa. Banamānuṣa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His name is Bon Mahārāja, and my Guru Mahārāja used to say <span class="Italic">banamānuṣa. Banamānuṣa</span> means the gorilla. (laughter) He is black also like gorilla. He has given so much trouble to Guru Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we should go now, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Called him back: "Call this rascal back." Every month he was being sent seven hundred rupees. That, in those days seven hundred rupees is a big amount. So at least ten time value has gone up. Seven hundred means seven thousand. He was spending for nothing, and he was publishing report, "Swamiji is playing on harmonium." And photo. This is first year, second, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And he told your Guru Mahārāja that "Unless we serve meat, they will not come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā!</span> I do not know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think you have once said that he had written to your Guru Mahārāja that letter. I heard that, that "Unless we serve meat," in England, when he was in England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was in England. Just like these rascals...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ramakrishna Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They serve <span class="Italic">muragī,</span> this chicken <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chicken <span class="Italic">prasādam!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You told us in Madras that your Guru Mahārāja used to call them the Muragī Mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another Godbrother used to say Muragī Mission, Chicken Mission. (laughter) He was so much against this Ramakrishna Mission and Vivekananda, so much. He knew all history of Ramakrishna. He became impotent. He was woman-hunter and therefore uneducated. In the village he was simply hunting after this low-class woman. Therefore his brother got him married. When he was married he was impotent. So therefore he planned, "Oh, I see everyone mother. You are my mother." And people said, "Oh, he's so realized that even his wife is his mother." Rascal. Where is that another person in the Vedic culture, Vyāsadeva, or, they are also married, who has called his wife mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone but the wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why one should not call a wife a mother? Is that very great advancement? But this rascal was impotent, he had no other alternative, so he manufactured some idea and people thought, "Oh, he's so devotee of goddess of Kālī that he sees even his wife as mother." This story he told me by Guru Mahārāja personally. He was talking with me privately somewhere, although I was a bad householder. (laughs) He was very kind upon me. And whatever is being done by his blessing, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, what time do you take your bath? Because I can get hot..., you know we have a big heater in this building. So for hot water...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes between quarter to one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should I make sure there's hot water at that time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You can put it through the pipe system? Anytime from twelve-thirty on. (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When the devotees heard about your idea for a neon sign on the top of the building, they all went "<span class="Italic">Jaya!</span>" They like that idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this street?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ninth Avenue. Sometime I'd like to show you the garage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On Ninth Avenue there are many grocery shops. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Don't you want a lead car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is the lead car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> They don't know the way; I do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Go straight on, I want to show Prabhupāda the garage. I'll show you where we have our garage. This whole area, all this brown area, all the way where the yellow stripe is. Big, big. It's huge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Down, the whole downstairs. Ten thousand square foot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That's the same..., ten thousand square feet is the same size as the book warehouse in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. The height is less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Height is... How high is it, Ādi-keśava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Ceiling is twenty feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Same height.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same height, huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The rent, this is the middle of Manhattan, only one block from the temple, so we got it for about $3.75 a square foot, very cheap, and on a three year lease, which is also very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tenth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our temple is between Eighth and Ninth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Jayānanda has been working very faithfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They've come to see what they are doing here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Blow the horn. You want to get out, Prabhupāda? (walking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have rented it from the railroad. This whole area is eight hundred dollars, we have rented. First class-electricity, water, it's first class. We can go around this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Jayānanda heard what you said about him. He said, "I will never let it happen again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, now it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Look at in there, Prabhupāda, this is really strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, no, if you keep it very nicely...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The other carts are..., this one is not yet finished as much as the others. Jayānanda, did you build this cart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayānanda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Chicago's old cart. Not the last year's one, an old one, we got it from them, they did not want it anymore. This will be Subhadrā's. They only want one cart, the one they have now. So we called them up and we said "Oh, don't throw it away, we'll take it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> How tall will they be with the canopies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifty foot high. These are the ones that Jayānanda and the men have built from scratch here in New York. You can see the powerful wheels. He heard what you had said, and then he decided to make it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As powerful as the other wheels?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> More powerful. Look at them, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is steel. This is steel. He built the carts in Australia. What is your opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> These are fantastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayānanda:</span> See, these are like this, flat plate on the outside, then there's a piece of chain that goes around the inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Amazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Think this is strong enough, Hari-śauri?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then he's covered it with canvas. This has rubber tire, and then it's covered by canvas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...steel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pretty big carts. These carts have the same mechanism, they go up and down, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is John. He's always helping us with the building. He works very hard. Which cart will Śrīla Prabhupāda ride on? Jayānanda? Which cart will Prabhupāda ride on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> We wanted to know which one. Which one would you like to ride on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Balarāma's cart goes in front?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Jagannātha's was going in front in San Francisco, then Subhadrā's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span>...told us Balarāma's is at the front,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, really.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And then Subhadrā's then Jagannātha at the back. That's the way they do it in Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What's that cart, Jayānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayānanda:</span> This is a little Ratha-yātrā cart from last year. We use it as an advertisement for the Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, it's a good advertisement. Quite an improvement from last year to this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole go-down is rented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, look at the area we get for eight hundred dollars, it's a great deal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight hundred dollars per month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> For the whole period, for three months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Three months. It's very good, because it gives protection for working in the sunshine and because it's so open there's a lot of air blowing, it's very cool for the workers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this factory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayānanda, what kind of factory is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayānanda:</span> Steel. They make sheet metal. It's owned by the railroad company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another thing we're using it for is we're using this for parking garage also. So we save the money for that, too. [break] (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, they have just reduced to one cart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They only had one cart. This was their old cart. Then last year they built a new cart. So this was just in storage there, not being used.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very strongly built.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, it is first-class. So we sent our big truck there and we picked it up, and we brought it here and assembled it, and now we have three carts. And these carts will be disassembled and kept in the garage. And the nice thing is that we are now on 60th Street and Eleventh Avenue and the festival is on 59th and Fifth. Very easy to get there. [break] These are mostly warehouses, Prabhupāda, this part of the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The city of New York is the most mismanaged city in the United States. The city government has a big debt. They borrow money from the banks and they cannot pay it back. So they..., the banks were closing the debt, the loans, calling for the loan, and they had no money, so they were firing everyone and there was great unemployment, and finally the United States government had to give them a free gift of money to bail them out. It is the worst management of any city in America. One of the big reasons is because of welfare. They give away free money to so many people in New York who don't want to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, welfare is actually waste of money. But social construction is so bad they have to give welfare. If they take our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, we can stop this welfare money, let them pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They don't know how to engage all these millions of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They don't know how to engage them, so they just give them free money. Also famous for its labor unions, the most powerful in America. They force the city to pay the highest wages for the garbage men, for school teachers, the highest anywhere in the country. So that's another reason they are in debt so much. (out of car, walking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's one of our posters for our Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What they are doing here(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The highest paid garbage men in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still it is unclean. This is subway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think it's a little quieter(?) from now on, Prabhupāda. This is the Plaza Hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Have you ever heard of it, the Plaza? [break] Growing out of stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is little crack, they are growing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Even on the roof of the building where we were sitting last night, between the cracks of the bricks on the roof, there were little plants coming out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Between the cracks in the stone. [break] (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When Balavanta was running for mayor of Atlanta he met him, so there's a good chance that if he gets elected to be President then that's easy opportunity to see the President.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What we'll do, seeing him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> At least, though, if he's favorable, if he likes us a little, it may give us, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Nobody can imagine what they do in all these office buildings. There are millions of offices.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're going to take a ride down Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the parade route?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Yes. You can see there's no wires, so we don't even have to bring the top down except for the very end entering into Washington Square Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] He has told that we have got already a copy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> was here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Where was that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This library is the biggest library in the country. Forty-second street. You can go back up on Madison and Park. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...carts all the way down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> It's fifty-two blocks, so it's going to take us at least two hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> About two to three hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The parade, Ratha-yātrā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two hours. [break]</div>
