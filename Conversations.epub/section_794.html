<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That time he lost to Johnson, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he was being elected. So he was... The signboard was "America needs Nixon."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think, when he was thrown out of office, he said "Well, I may have had so many faults, but at least I increased our good relations with other countries." He was always... He was trying to convince everybody that he may not have been very good at domestic affairs, but at foreign affairs he was expert, so then that made his administration not so bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> One thing... The one thing that caused his downfall, that when they heard the tapes... He had recorded all of his conversations, private conversations with his ministers. So it turned out that it was horrible language. Practically every other word was dirty word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That dirty word used by him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Practically every other word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Filthy language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They discovered... So this is what also hurt him because they discovered some tape of private conversations, and it was very, very obscene. Practically every other word was bad word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a lawyer. He's a lawyer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> In America now, so many so-called cultured men, lawyers and doctors and so many cultured men, their language is very horrible, their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vulgar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Their whole attitude is vulgar also, not just language but whole... Yeah. And like even in Europe before, a gentleman was a gentleman. They were... I think. And even in America before, they had some good qualities. But now the so-called gentlemen or educated men, they're very vulgar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Vicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Becoming more and more gross.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore their sons are hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The father is <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara,</span> the son is also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The more vulgar you are, the more glorified you become, especially like all these film stars and public figures. The more of a drunkard they are, then the more they're publicized in the news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like John Lennon. He is a public man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. What he is? He's standing naked and taking photograph. His wife and he, standing naked. I have seen. And that picture is there in his sitting room, fireplace. That is the picture. (laughs) I went to see him. I was his guest. So one day I was... I saw there that big picture on the fireplace. And here is a public... Newspapermen go to him to take his opinion. "What is your opinion?" Just see. What is his value? Nobody... He is public leader because he has got some money. Money is the criterion. Therefore people are accumulating money some way or other. He knows that "If I got money, then I'll have all influence over the society."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A rich man no matter what his morals or character...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, nobody cares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...he becomes very attractive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he has no good quality. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the... From the Vedic angle of vision, the Western people are the most uncivilized. Only money is covering them. When they introduced that mini-skirt for the girl, how much abominable it was considered in India. But they very publicly introduced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Now even in India, slowly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They'll imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> When the prime minister of Canada, when he was, when he first began running, he was a young bachelor, very good looking, long hair. And he sent around girls in mini-skirts, kissing men on the cheeks, giving them a little candy for his campaign, and he, he almost got all the votes, became the prime minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> We were talking yesterday how nice this story of Prahlāda Mahārāja is, because no matter how great a demon becomes, still, he cannot vanquish the devotees, even if the devotee is a very insignificant little boy, only five years old. These demons seem so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> ...horrible. The society is so degraded. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> 6:20.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? The idea of reincarnation. That is horrible for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If they understood that they would have to pay later for what they're doing now, they wouldn't be able to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So, what is the report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Er... The printing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Our. (?) Fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're doing that, printing fifty...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That will be ready after the festival? [break] ...an elephant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Elephant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No elephant. Why elephant? Elephant is royal. We are not royal. We are beggars, <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> beggars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> These buses arriving in the village will be very... People will never forget it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That procession we had in the villages near Ahmedabad, in the villages there, that must have been a once in a lifetime experience for most of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can go there... And now, wherever we shall go, they will be received like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They especially mentioned...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Indian people are meant for that purpose. They are from the birth, <span class="Italic">janma</span>... Other, they are <span class="Italic">janmanā śūdra,</span> but Indians, they are <span class="Italic">janmanā</span> devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I meant to mention that he commented that when they were coming from Andhra, when they, as they're getting closer to Bengal, in Orissa, and then even more so in Bengal, the, both in Ori... so many <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> was there. The people were meeting them with <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and everyone was doing <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> But in Andhra and other places, not so much <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They say they get much better reception in Orissa and Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And already they picked up one devotee, I think. Devotees come also quicker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Lord Caitanya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I think if we concentrated first in Bengal and Orissa, we get some, enough devotees, and then they could help us in the other villages elsewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> All over India. Like Madana already got three devotees when I was there in one week. By now he may also have more. Bengalis like <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> very much. [break] ...devotees are Bengalis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...ago Bengali culture was very much adored all over India. Even one big politician, Gandhi's guru, Goke, Gokule, he remarked, "What Bengal thinks today, other provinces will think tomorrow." He said like that. And actually all big, big movements started from Bengal. The national movement also was started from Bengal. Whatever we may criticize Vivekananda, when... He's a Bengali. He went first for preaching Indian religion. Rabindranath Tagore, he's a Bengali. All big, big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Aurobindo.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I don't know him... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I've heard of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bengali culture was very much adored. Surendranath Bannerjee started the political movement, and he was so well known. Even in Parliament, the Englishmen, English M.P.'s, he... They were speaking of Surendranath. They used to say "Surrendered not." "Here is a person who is not 'Surrender not.' He'll never surrender. 'Surrender not.' " Actually, the British Empire was startled by the agitation of Surendranath Bannerjee. The Congress was started by Surendranath Bannerjee, this one Congress. Two Bengali and one Englishman started this Congress sometimes in 1887, 1867, like that. So in our childhood we used to see that Surendranath Bannerjee was being elected president of Congress almost every year. And Gandhi came into prominence when Surendranath Bannerjee surrendered. Formerly he was not surrendering. But the government gave him the first ministership, that "You become minister." So he became a government man. Then Gandhi came in prominence. Surendranath Bannerjee was the first minister in India. [break] ...in our childhood, if he would speak, thousands, thousands men will gather in Calcutta. [break] ...Surendranath Bannerjee Road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes, very prominent road.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> It's a smaller road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Doctor's land, Dr. Durgacaran Bannerjee Road, they belonged to very respectable family of that quarter, Bannerjee family. And Surendranath Bannerjee was the first I.C.S. I.C.S. He passed I.C.S. examination, Indian Civil Service, but he did not accept it. Aurobindo Ghosh was made by Surendranath Bannerjee. He was born in London. Aurobindo Ghosh's father, Manmohan Ghosh, he was a medical man in London. He was born... He's English birth. Well, later on, he became English-hater.</div>

After his release from political entanglement, actually he became a yogi, but this Frenchwoman, who became later on "Mother," she spoiled her ca..., his career. He became a <span class="Italic">bhogī</span> then. (laughter) Instead of yogi... Otherwise, he was becoming yogi. You'll find from his photo.
