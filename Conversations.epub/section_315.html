<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...gatvā duḥkhānusaṅgaminaḥ.</span> There is misery. Even you go to the Moon planet... This is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> Before going to your Moon planet here is the information: "Anywhere you go rascal these things will follow, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi [Bg. 13.9]</span> and inconveniences. You'll have to suffer." So one's who's, one who is intelligent, then: "Where shall I find real happiness?" That is Kṛṣṇa. Therefore one requires to be very, very intelligent to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. <span class="Italic">Sarva, sarvatra bhasananvita</span> (?). The Śrīdhara Svāmī gives note, <span class="Italic">sarvatra lokāntare 'pi.</span> Even if you go to other planets... Now these rascals are going now, trying, not going. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">lokāntare 'pi.</span> Even in other planets. That means they were going in other planets. Otherwise how it is stated, <span class="Italic">lokāntare,</span> "in other planets also"? From the statement it appears that people used to go. And here, Arjuna went to heavenly planet. And there the heavenly prostitute came to Arjuna. She's prostitute. So when Arjuna refused, that... His father is Indra...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Arjuna said that "You have connection with my father. Therefore you are my mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You mentioned him in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> purport. When one yogi was performing severe austerities, Lord Indra would send the dancing girls. They were called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Apsarās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Apsarās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He would send them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same thing here. Just like prostitute, they are going to the club. The father is going also; the son is going. And the prostitute is the same. Everywhere, this material happiness, wine, women...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I think there... That boy, Ranchor, his father said, "You leave Kṛṣṇa consciousness and I will give you a car and women."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Your father also said like that. (laughter) Here father will feel shame to advise the son, or the son will feel shame to talk about sex with father or mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About sex one can talk with friends, not with father and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Not with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in western countries it is very open talk. And open business also. <span class="Italic">Sarvatra. Sarvatra lokāntare 'pi vasanavagatya iha duḥkhānusaṅghanena, nivṛtta-kāma...</span>(?) So one should give up this material sense gratification. The more you become entangled in material sense gratification, more you'll have to remain in this material world. <span class="Italic">Iti tiprokti malakam taṁ proktaṁ kāma karma prokta gena iti, ahaṁ deva upasya yesantai saṅghata nirvaira adrstitvaṁ samyag anvasya duḥkha, sukha-duḥkha eva, sukha-duḥkha...</span>(?) Water is wasted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Almost full. Very slow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vīrarāghavācārya: deha-geha-gehayoḥ ātmiya buddhiḥ jihasaya tyāgecchāya</span> (?). <span class="Italic">Ātma-buddhi,</span> this family, society, friendship and love. Yes. To feel very much affection... What is called? Attached. <span class="Italic">Tyāgecchā.</span> It should be given up. Therefore the <span class="Italic">sannyāsa āśrama.</span> Just try to deliver this message very... Everyone is in darkness. Therefore I was speaking. They do not know what is <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> Yesterday, you were present? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> What is perfection of life, they do not know. Neither they have information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Simply they talk about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All foolish. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Blind man leading other blind men. There is no sense. Whole civilization. It is, this Kṛṣṇa con..., our movement is a challenge to everyone, a challenge, genuine challenge. After all, everyone wants happiness, but they do not know what is happiness. So you can make few <span class="Italic">puris</span> and <span class="Italic">kittri.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Śrutakīrti! Prabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Pālikā is already cooking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puris,</span> he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi</span> can also be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> <span class="Italic">Puri</span> or <span class="Italic">parāṭā,</span> I think, would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Parāṭā</span> can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes, she is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can give me massage now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Massage him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Nama oṁ viṣṇu-pādāya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarvatra vasanava gatya</span> (?). So if this advertisement attracts some people, then I can remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To organize this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For some time. Oh, they have got a bath also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yamunā has... She has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Yamunā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I guess she is out shopping also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarvatra vyasanad apy atra...</span> (?) Now here, as soon as we came, we thought it very nice, and immediately...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> So many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many inconveniences. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Vyasanad apy atra.</span> Wherever you go, even though you found it is very convenient, very nice, you must know there is, there is inconvenience. Don't be so sure that it is full of nice things. No. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Sarvatra vyasanad api.</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Fifteen minutes of water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh... So you, you can get that connection disconnected now. Otherwise you're going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes. I could also connect over to here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For the time being, you disconnect. Otherwise it will fall down.</div>
