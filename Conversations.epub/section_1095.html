<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda is the author of all these books that you see. These books are being translated in every major language of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> How many books in number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Eighty-four books of about 400 pages each.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> How many in vernacular languages printing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About 21 different languages they have been translated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, international. French, Italian...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> In India? Indian languages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Tamil, Oriya, Bengali, Gujarati. Every major Indian language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Can you tell us the different subjects covered by the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's Vedic subjects, the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are stressing especially on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Do you have special on each chapter of <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Each word. You can show <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A very authoritative presentation. For example, here's the original Sanskrit <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> word for word...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> For example, <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga.</span> You have a separate book? Then <span class="Italic">sthita-prajñā.</span> You have a separate...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No separately. It is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But that way, your volumes are dealing with each chapter of <span class="Italic">Gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each <span class="Italic">śloka.</span> Each chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, no. Not inside the book. Different volumes. Like eighteen chapters, but eighteen volumes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. It's in one book. Twelve hundred pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> And the interpretation is by you yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not interpretation. I am explaining as it is. You can read one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Have you tried to compare with <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> written by Gyaneshvara, or by Vinoba Bhave or by somebody else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> if you don't follow the instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you may be very learned scholar, whatever you write, it is lost. We follow that principle. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this Fourth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Have these books been reviewed in foreign papers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very widely read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For example, in the Fourth Chapter Lord Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">evaṁ paramparā-prāptam<br class="calibre2"/>imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ<br class="calibre2"/>sa kāleneha mahatā<br class="calibre2"/>yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 4.2]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says that this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has to be received by the disciplic succession. And <span class="Italic">sa kālena yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> Because that disciplic succession is now broken, that yoga system is now lost. So all these interpreters, they are interpreting in their own way. Therefore it is lost. So there is no use of consulting this lost version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So you just give it as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... Therefore my <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is named <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> No interpretation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Each word is the original Sanskrit <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> English transliteration, word by word meaning, so there's no room for manipulation. There's a translation and purport. Every book that Śrīla Prabhupāda has written has the same format and each book is illustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Do you believe that the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> should be followed as it is or interpretation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. If you read somebody's book, you must read the author's version. Why should you bring interpretation? This is... You have no business. If you want to say something of your philosophy, you can say, but why do you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and give your own interpretation? That is very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But can you not apply your own philos...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why should you? If you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you should speak what <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is saying. And interpretation is required when the thing is not understood clearly. There you get interpretation. Unnecessarily, why should you interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> You have no right. <span class="Italic">Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> So anyone can understand there is a place Kurukṣetra still. Why should you interpret, "Kurukṣetra means this body and this and that," why? What is the necessity? Do you think there is necessity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> But just as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all let us settle, that <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> begins</div>
<div class="Verse">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre<br class="calibre2"/>samavetā yuyutsavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māmakāḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva<br class="calibre2"/>kim akurvata sañjaya<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 1.1]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">So <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> is the history and there was Battle of Kurukṣetra. And that Kurukṣetra is mentioned there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and it is <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra</span> since Vedic age. So the word used, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre</span> and <span class="Italic">kuru-kṣetre,</span> it is completely understood. Why should you interpret unless you have got a motive. And why a sane man accepts that interpretation? If you have got a different philosophy you can write your own book. Why should you cheat others, taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and interpreting in your own way? This has spoiled the whole thing. And Kṛṣṇa says that as soon as you deviate from the disciplic succession system then it will be lost. So what is the use of reading something which is already lost? If I want to supply you something food, it must be fresh and palatable. Then you'll enjoy. But if it is rotten, decomposed, and if we supply you that foodstuff, what you will enjoy and what you will get benefit out of it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Most Hindus, they are not properly able to understand Kṛṣṇa direct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have already explained, that when you cannot understand, then you interpret. But when it is clearly understood why should you interpret?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> How you explain the act of Kṛṣṇa taking away the saris of the <span class="Italic">gopīs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, try to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then go to the sari of <span class="Italic">gopī.</span> You do not know what is Kṛṣṇa and you are going to His <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> This is another malinterpretation. You are studying <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> talk of that. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the <span class="Italic">gopīs' </span>saris are not mentioned. So why you are bringing <span class="Italic">gopīs' </span>saris now? This is our fault.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Normally, you know our people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is our fault There is no mention of <span class="Italic">gopīs' </span>saris. We are talking of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> why you are bringing <span class="Italic">gopīs' </span>saris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Because that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again because. There is no subject matter there. You have no right to bring that. That is our fault. To bring a horse before a cart. We are talking of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> There is no mention of Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">gopīs' </span>saris there. So let us talk. Finish that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> So you clearly said that interpretation is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Interpretation means lost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, no. You clearly said that interpretation is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> What has been done all these years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they have done all these years wrong, that does it not right. If all of them have done wrong, then combined together it does not become right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Will you repeat your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean to say if everyone has done wrong, then combined together will it become right? Hundreds of zeroes will make one? It will remain zero. It will not be effective. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sa kālena yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> And what is the next line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Next line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya</span> [Bg. 4.3]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa eva ayam yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ.</span> "Therefore I am saying you again, the old yoga system. It is not that because the time has changed, I am changing." Somebody says, "Now it was spoken some millions of years ago, now it is modern ways, I am explaining in the modern way." That is not the system. The system is I am speaking the same yoga system. <span class="Italic">Yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ.</span> And they are modernizing, making compromise. That is <span class="Italic">naṣṭa.</span> That is the defect. Therefore we did not get any benefit. And in the modern countries, before me, so many yogis, swamis have been there for the last two hundred years. Not a single person became a Hindu. Now they are calling (them) "American Hindus." Why? Because it was lost. Rotten thing was given. <span class="Italic">Yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> If you supply something to me which is rotten and decomposed, such foodstuff, what shall I get benefit? Now they are getting benefit. Our mission is to put <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. It is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission that He said, <span class="Italic">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa</span> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone of you become a guru and deliver these persons, these fallen conditioned souls. That is your business. Now you can say, or I can say that how can I become guru? I have no education, I have no talent. How can I become guru? The answer is <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> You simply repeat what Kṛṣṇa has said, you become guru. So we are doing like that. We haven't got to manufacture. We haven't got to take so much trouble or create it by our fertile brain. We are simply repeating what Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all. And see how it is effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Do you mean it that a man who is under so much tension can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, try to see the distinction. Before me, so many people went. They misinterpreted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there was no effect. And we are not misinterpreting. We are simply presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is given. That is the point. Everyone says, "Swamiji, you have done wonderful thing." But I say , "I do not know any magic, jugglery. But wonderful thing is that I have not adulterated." That is wonderful. Otherwise, nothing wonderful. What I am saying? <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> I am creating them <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> that's all. I am starting these temples and ask them that "Here is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. You become devotee, you always chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That's all. And they are giving up everything. Their father and mother, they are thinking, "They are our lost child." They are now giving the opposition. They have brought so many cases against me. But unless it is effective, how they are feeling the weight? Now these boys, their father, mother constantly kidnap them. "Stay here." No, they will not stay. They'll not eat with their father, mother. So they think that "Our son is lost." Other yogis and swamis go, they give some method. And the son is there at home."All right, a young man is going there." But here, their son is lost. Here their son is lost, and they are now called "American Hindus." So naturally they are very much against me. And counter movement is going on. Hindus... The government...That this is not a religion. The swami knows some mind-controlling power and he's brainwashing. In this way, there is charge. So because America has got freedom of religion, so if they accept my movement as Hindu religion, they cannot do anything. People are free to accept. But they are giving in a different charge, that I have manufactured something, that no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling. How people can accept all these things? They're brainwashed. There are so many charges. But anyone who comes to me, I don't make any compromise. Yes... (end)</div>
