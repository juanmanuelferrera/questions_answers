<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...have discrimination because the British government, they think that the Ratha-yatra is becoming very popular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the... It is actually rational discrimination. The Christians, they thought, "Now these Englishmen, they'll make Hindu religion very prominent." Because it is a fact. If we introduce such three-four celebrations, then Christianity will be finished. But what is there? Christianity, there is nothing. Simply some dry words. And actually, they're seeing, nobody's coming to the church. So in this way, if they some, relish something better, then whatever is there, that will be finished, also. Therefore in London we wanted to purchase a church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> A big cathedral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. And they said, "We shall burn it down; still, we shall not give to Bhaktivedanta Swami." They said like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "We shall burn it down." They are seeing practically. After all, they are businessmen. "Shopkeeper's nation." They see practically that if such kind of movements go on... People are already, have no interest in the church. In Chicago, they wrote "American Hindus." They wrote in the paper. Then Hindu, Hindu religion will be prominent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The Catholic Church is a very wealthy institution, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The Catholic Church is very wealthy. They don't want to lose their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what will wealth do? If it does not appeal to the people, what wealth will do? In Chicago also, the Christians came with some wooden signboard. You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, I didn't see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "It is through Christ. It is through..." They were showing me. So that has been criticized by the newspapermen, that "Nobody cares for you." (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> In New York also, we have to do negotiations very secretly because if they find out, they would not want to sell to us. They would be afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, New York, there was Ratha-yatra?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, no. For purchasing the church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They're also afraid that we will take over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not yet finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Well, it is going on now. The one building is finished. Other building is still... Until we are living there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, one Japanese gentleman wrote in a paper that "This Movement, as it growing fast, within ten years the whole world will become Hindu ."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (laughter) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So even it is as it is, they may take in palanquin, but there must be a protest meeting continuously. Protest meeting and the Indians should approach the Ambassador that, "Represent our case to the Queen that Hindus are being harassed." This should be organized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> And also newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Also newspaper. There must be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They can make advertisements in the newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That "On certain plea only, they have stopped our most important ceremony." In this way agitation must go on. And our men, those who took part in political agitation, they should go there and speak everywhere, that "It is religious discrimination."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They should have a protest meeting in front of the Parliament building, with signs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Protest meeting must be there. How to organize? At least, a protest meeting should be done in such a way that the whole world may know that the British Government stopped the yearly Ratha-yatra ceremony of the Hindus. That should be organized. What can be done? You are not very strong GBC's. There must be vehement protest meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They can protest in front of Downing Street, in front of the Prime Minister's residence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, protest meeting, go on, organize. Go, all of you. What is the talking here? They have seen that the movement is growing more important. So this is discrimination. In England the Church is very strong. They have organized like this. You quote the publication, "There is no alarm." Of course, it is on the plea of police protest, police objection. The police objection means one's religious ceremony should be stopped? What is this? Simply for some technical mistake, now they can warn that "You must do it. Otherwise it will be stopped." How is that? No. That means this is police government? Does it mean it is police government?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Police state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Police state? And why they are declaring Commonwealth and, British Commonwealth. So if it is governed by the police, how it is Commonwealth? There should be very strong agitation. And all the Hindus will join. So who will organize it? Don't make it childish. It is very serious. (pause) Police should have taken task when the rules were broken by Mahādeva. Why they did not take action in that time? They did not say anything. Police, if there is discrepancy, violation of the rules, they should have taken immediate action. Why they did not take? Now they have manufactured by conspiracy that "This movement should be stopped. Now take this plea." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They could even have been paid off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Perhaps they were also paid off to stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paid off or not paid off, it doesn't matter. But actually it is stopped. And if we simply cede, then there is no future hope of this movement. Better, in spite of their "No" order, we shall take the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Take the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Take it anyway?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And let them be arrested. That is the real thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you go all there, and perform this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) Make the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> as it is and keep it on the Hyde Park. Don't move it, and hold meeting. Don't go the Trafalgar Square, but organize huge meeting there. Don't move it. "Under protest, we are not moving, but this is discrimination." Organize like that. Have the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> standing there. Unless the order is given. And go on holding meeting. That will be the right answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They can bring the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> in on a big truck.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ratha,</span> we start from the Hyde Park to Trafalgar Square. So the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be there. We'll not move. And simply hold meeting, unless the order is given. This is the right course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They should have a meeting until the order is given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Until the order is given, we shall hold meeting here. Daily." And tell them that "It is, it is police government. Then we should, we should give up British connection." Agitate government that "It has become a police government." Best course will be like that, that "As usual, we shall keep the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> there. We are not moving." And hold on, go on protest meeting, doing. And keep them there. Let them arrest and go to jail. That is the real effort. (pause) Or one thing do... <span class="Italic">Satī sārthaṁ samācaret.</span> Therefore I wanted to start this politics. There say, "It is, it is our custom. Unless the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> is there, there is no ceremony. So you have asked to palanquin. We shall make the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> here, standing. And after holding our ceremony we shall take the Deity in palanquin and go to the Trafalgar Square. And go to the Trafalgar Square and hold meeting there. But the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be there. It will not move. It will stand here. We shall take the Deities in palanquin and go to the Trafalgar Square." In this way, take police permission, and after going there, along with the ceremony, protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In Trafalgar Square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Trafalgar Square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They cannot object if the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> is not moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all. That "You, objection... Our <span class="Italic">ratha</span> will not move. It will simply stand there. The Deity will go in palanquin to Trafalgar Square and come back." They cannot object. But the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be seen. And people must know that the rascal police government has stopped it. Go, everyone, and do it. The <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be exhibited, even though it does not move. And the Deity will be moving in palanquin. And come back again to the <span class="Italic">ratha.</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you execute all this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it. Ratha-yatra <span class="Italic">ratha</span> is there, but the police did not allow to move. That's all right. We shall not move. The Deities, three palanquins, taken together, procession will go to the Trafalgar... That is, that is allowed. But the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be exhibited. It will not move. So what is their objection. If the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> stands in the same place, without movement, then they cannot have any objection. As they have passed, the Deities will move, and we'll come back again. Is it any... Eh? What objection can...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That is approved for the route?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, they can walk with the palanquins over the route, to Trafalgar Square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That's approved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ratha</span> will not move. Then when we will get sanction, it will move. And for the sanction we must go on protesting. If you can take these steps, then do it. Otherwise, sleep. [break] ...with Haṁsadūta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> I can talk to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Talk with clear brain. The idea is given. [break] ...be able to do it alone, or we shall go. Or even if he does not say, you go and all organize. It is very important thing. And things are going not right there, and you shall sleep here. That is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So shall we also make protests?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all organize this. Then we shall protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Protest at the meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah. Don't say about protesting now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take this, tactfully, that "All right, our <span class="Italic">ratha</span> will not move. But this is our ceremony. The <span class="Italic">ratha</span> will stand there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So they should get written permission for the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> to stand there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">"Ratha</span> will stand, will not move, unless you sanction. But it is the, one of the part of the ceremony. There must be <span class="Italic">ratha.</span> How you can stop it?" And from the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> the palanquin will go to the Trafalgar Square. As usual, we hold our ceremonies and come back. So what is the objection? And if they say, "No, you cannot even keep the <span class="Italic">ratha,</span>" that means there is conspiracy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there is conspiracy. So we should be politicians also [break] ...somebody protested that "Your Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement makes the people dull." And now, you have not seen the Vaiṣṇava. There was two fight in the Indian history. One is Rāma and Rāvaṇa, and one is Kurukṣetra. And the hero is Vaiṣṇava. We are going to produce such Vaiṣṇavas, not these dull rascals, sitting down. We don't want these Vaiṣṇavas, sitting down rascals. We want Arjuna or we want no one. That is Vaiṣṇava. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's time to go back. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that if we remain rascals, then that Gaurasundara's example will be followed. One day you'll again become crazy and close up everything and smoke. That's all. My Guru Mahārāja used to say, <span class="Italic">prāṇa arthe yaṅra sei hetu pracāra.</span> "One who has got life, he can preach." The dead man cannot preach. So you become with life, not like dead man. Without life... Just like all my godbrothers. They are dead men. And therefore they are envious of my activities. They have no life. If you want to make easy-going life, showing the Deity and then sleep, then it is a failure movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, I have given the solution. The <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be there. It may not move. That is another thing. It will stand. The Deity will move on palanquin accordingly. Take this sanction. And then, coming back, hold big meeting, protest meeting. <span class="Italic">Ratha</span> must be there. It will not move. The movement will be by palanquin. I think... I don't think there is any difficulty. How there can be any objection? Reasonably? There cannot be any objection. Let the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> stand there, and the Deity moves according to your sanction... What objection can be there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Unless there's a conspiracy, there should be no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That will disclose their conspiracy. "We abide by your order that without your order our <span class="Italic">ratha</span> will not move, go to the Trafalgar... That's all right. You have allowed palanquin. That's accepted." Do like that, tactfully. First of all, take the sanction. In America, in... They have appreciated. That Reverend Powell. No, there is no objection anywhere. Why this rascal, falling-down nation, British, they're objecting? <span class="Italic">Apāt-kāle viparīta-buddhi.</span> They are falling down, they will commit offense and discrepancies more and more so that they will be nowhere. I think after this Queen, this monarchy there, the so-called monarchy will be also finished. Because her son, her husband, both of them are hippies. The Queen's husband and Queen's son, the Prince of Wales, both of them are hippies. So this monarchy will be also finished. (pause) What that Mahādeva is doing there in Africa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's not doing very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a rascal, and he was given in charge. Another rascal, Śyāmasundara. What he's doing, sitting and..., only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Just sitting and writing things that cannot be understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Writing where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's doing all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him stay there. Don't allow him to come out. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He was planning to leave any day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he cannot go. Then we shall charge you all theft charges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Theft charges. He's, he stolen money, and he has stolen something in Bombay also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Prabhupāda, they still have so many debts from last year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> They still owe money for last year's festival, so many thousands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is... And even somehow or other, he goes out, then he should not be allowed strictly either in our, this temple or that temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let him go to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Actually, he was planning to see Revatīnandana Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He was planning to go and visit Revatīnandana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, the Revatīnandana and this man and Śyāmasundara is making a clique. I can understand. What they are planning, that also I know. But I don't wish to disclose it. So if these things come, then how this movement will go on? Politics, diplomacy, fraud, cheating, these are the general qualification of the western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Sitting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Politics, diplomacy, fraud, cheating. These things are the general qualification of the western people. Do you admit or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they are, these things come within our movement, then it will not be succesful. <span class="Italic">Tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to become purified. Even sometimes we have to take... But that is for Kṛṣṇa's. There must be now checking that all these rascals may not join and spoil the movement. You should not admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can come and go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We should not make a haven for rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We should not create a haven for rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So how it will be done unless you GBC members become very strong and with good brain? Now, first of all save this situation. This is only solution, as I have suggested, that "The <span class="Italic">ratha</span> must be there. We are not moving." And take lawyers. And the Deity will be moved. And we'll come to the <span class="Italic">ratha</span> and go back. That's all. And we shall abide by all the rules. That's all. They saw it that in open sunshine thousands of people, ten thousands of people or more than that, fifteen thousand people, they stood on the Trafalgar Square for three hours. And they do not go to the church. So they must have seen there is something. Otherwise, how people taken so much interest. And there is, actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes. Just like in the San Francisco paper they admitted, "This is the most popular festival."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. San Francisco also. Fifteen thousand people attended my lecture silently. So they are seeing now there is something in this movement, and if this movement, it is allowed to go on without any objection, then Christianity will be finished. That is the conspiracy behind it. That lecture is recorded? The, which I gave in the, that society of the priests and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The fathers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes, I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can hear that lecture, how it was. They appreciated so much. We have no disrespect for Christianity. (pause) At least, expose our so-called Indian ambassador and others... Approach them, that "Help us. What is this? What for you are here?" Even they do not allow by agitation, make the movement very important. Make profit this side or that side. That is businessman. The businessman makes profit when the price is going down and when the price is going up. They make their profit. That is businessman. Just like our Tripurāri, he goes on selling his book in any condition. He finds out some means how to sell in this condition. This is intelligence, how to deal in different circumstances and make profit. That is brain. And if you make condition, "If these conditions are there, then I can make business," that is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You told me that when I came from Pakistan to India. I was complaining how difficult it was, but you said that a businessman makes profit in any circumstances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is business. They are... Police has no eyes to see that the Bala-Krishna (Guru Maharaji) is regularly cheating. Any man can understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no stoppage of that... Yes. And here, stoppage. Just see. It is clear conspiracy. It is not that police. Police cannot be so powerful that he can stop. If there was any discrepancy, why did not they take step that "You have done... You have violated the rules." They should have prosecuted us. Now, without saying anything at that time, now want to stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It's just their tactic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is tactic. They're factually seeing that "These people, they have brought some Jagannātha and thousands of people following it. And nobody's coming to our church?" It is very common sense thing. The church is being closed. And all the young men, they are joining. Not old men, old fools. No. All young, flourishing, young men are joining. So they want to stop it now. (pause) Take it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhukāṇṭa:</span> ...regard, Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that we are making counter-propaganda against <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will make propaganda very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhukāṇṭa:</span> So we must become very sincere devotees or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless we are very sincere, we cannot cope with <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is not possible. If you remain a servant of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> you cannot conquer over <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You must be very sincere servant of Kṛṣṇa. Then you can conquer. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> It is clearly said. Otherwise you are subjected to the tricks of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Unless one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can get rid of <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> tricks. Otherwise, you may dress yourself like anything, but you are simply <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> servant. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has sung one... <span class="Italic">Ei ota kalir chelā:</span> "Here is another disciple of Kali." <span class="Italic">Nake tilaka galai mālā.</span> "He has got <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> on the nose and <span class="Italic">mālā, kaṇṭhi,</span> also." <span class="Italic">Sahaja bhajana kache mamu saṅge lana pare bhalo:</span> "And he's, he has become a Vaiṣṇava by illicit sex." This is stated by Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. "Here is a Kali's <span class="Italic">chelā.</span> He has dressed like a Vaiṣṇava, but he is doing his <span class="Italic">bhajan</span> with illicit sex." <span class="Italic">Sahaje bhajana kache mamu saṅge lana pare bhalo.</span> You know? There is a class of <span class="Italic">sahajiyās?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Vaiṣṇavas. Just like, dress like Rūpa Gosvāmī, loincloth, and, but three dozen women behind him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: "Here is a disciple of Kali. He has <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and he has <span class="Italic">kunti</span> and he's doing this nonsense." <span class="Italic">Eita kalir chela.</span> (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> So the purport is that one must strictly follow the principles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not understand that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are asking after twelve thousand years? I am speaking always that. And still you are questioning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Should I call immediately or wait till after class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Should I call Haṁsadūta immediately or wait until after class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, you use your discrimination. What I can say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda! (end)</div>
