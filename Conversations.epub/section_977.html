<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Most are at the farm, waiting. Here there is about sixty; the rest are there. They told me that after I told them that you might not come, the next morning at <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārtik</span> no one was dancing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) I know that. Therefore I come in this old age to encourage the devotees. (coughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There is nice water here, from the source, we have a source.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There is a source, a natural spring not far from here, and people take there water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You all bring all drinking water from there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, yours. (pause) Here, we are an hour ahead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> One hour ahead, 12:20. We have bitter melon and all fruits and vegetables, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who will cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have Mandakini?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mandakini has not cooked very nice last...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There is Aditi, there is... The wife of Hari-vilāsa, she cooked for you before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, she can cook.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What is bitter melon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bitter melon, you teach them how to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Samosa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily, simple prepare nice <span class="Italic">dahl,</span> nice rice, vegetables, some bitter melon, and two, three <span class="Italic">capatis,</span> that's all. Not cumbrous. Must be well cooked, rice. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Mung dahl</span> is all right? <span class="Italic">Mung dahl</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mung dahl,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> <span class="Italic">Mung dahl.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It boils nicely? Any <span class="Italic">dahl</span> which boils nicely, that's all right. Without being boiled, it is useless. (long pause) Is it working or not? (referring to the bell)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We tried it yesterday, it was working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think it is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee:</span> Yesterday we tried everything. It was working, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any buzzing? Is there any buzzing? No. (coughing) (devotees fix the bell)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Where is that <span class="Italic">lota</span> for Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I told them two o'clock their time, which is one o'clock your time from London, because there's a compromise of..., in between the two, and in that way it would adjust. I also told them not to make anything fancy but to make very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? They will not be able.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Hari-vilāsa's wife? Parijāta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, she's,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> She's here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So I explained to her, and Arundhatī's going to show her the cooker and everything, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arundhatī cannot. She cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, she's not so... She knows the mechanics of it, but the details are difficult. When we get to the farm there is a separate kitchen, and every spare minute I will be with him and just teach him everything in great detail. [break] (lecture:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am very glad to see you again in this village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Haribol!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. It was the prediction of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu that in every village, in every town on the surface of the globe, there will be preaching of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu's name and the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> It is to be translated? (translator translates into French) So by your transcendental endeavor it is being fulfilled, otherwise who expected that in this remote village of France, Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> would be chanted? When Caitanya Mahāprabhu said in every village, in every town, he did not mean that every village and every town in India. He specifically says <span class="Italic">pṛthivīte,</span> means on the surface of the globe. So the purpose is that without spreading of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, nobody can become happy. That's a fact. The opportunity of human form of life is systematcially being refused by the modern civilization. This material activity only for the bodily comforts of life, that is not human civilization. Human civilization means the human being must know the supreme controller and the aim of life. The real fact is that God is there, the supreme controller, and we, living entities, we are His parts and parcels. As parts and parcels of God, we, being separated, we are suffering. An example can be given in this connection, just like a small child is the part and parcel of the body of the mother. So the child is happy when the child is on the lap of the mother. That means the part and the whole must live together. Then there is happiness. Otherwise, there is distress. The modern godless civilization is making the part and the whole separated. Therefore the whole condition is chaotic. You have got experience in your this part of the globe, within fifty years there have been two big, big wars and... Many other parts also. People are not in happiness on account of godlessness. So actually if we want to be happy in this life and the next life, then we must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And it is not at all difficult: simply chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> So I am very glad that you are accustomed to chant this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Stick to it and you'll all be happy. Thank you very much. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> These are all smelling flowers. They're very sweet, like gardenia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, developed(?) in our garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, we bought. These we cannot grow. We bought these special.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got a greenhouse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still you cannot grow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It was too late, we started too late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last time I stayed in this room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, you stayed in another room. You stayed in my office. This is silk wallpaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Saffron.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Organize this center very nicely. So many people will be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The devotees are very ecstatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Yes, there was no hope for my coming. Now I've come, they must be. (laughter) Sunshine will stay at least up to noon, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No, till five o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. It is going like this. It goes from this room into your room. All day long it is lit. They said it was hot in this room until six o'clock last night, very hot. If you'd like, I can show you how to use some things in the bathroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All the taps, they are the same. The red here, this is hot. All you do is lift up. [break] And the cows are also coming here, you can see later. These are all big oak trees, they are very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harikeśa, have you came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All the marble, I had it made in Italy especially for you. This is all lotus flower carving they have done. And the bookshelves also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This also marble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Everything is designed for Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I can use this closet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> All these are closets. These are many pillows, if people come, they can sit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Very nice, so you can keep here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's coming in a few minutes. Have to order that. Tapioca.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is there any store near here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not immediately. Just or you have got barley powder?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They are getting this morning. They are taking it to get ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately, there is no stock?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yasya deve parā bhaktir<br class="calibre2"/>yathā deve tathā gurau<br class="calibre2"/>tasyaite kathitā hy arthāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prakāśante mahātmanaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [<span class="calibre3">ŚU</span> 6.23]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This desire to serve guru is the qualification. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve para bhaktir yathā deve tathā gurau.</span> In the spiritual life, this is the secret of success. <span class="Italic">Yasya deve parā bhaktir yathā...</span> In many places. Our Gauḍīya Matha people, those who were leaders, they wanted to supersede the order of Guru Mahārāja. Therefore it was failure. Very, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They have painted that nice picture. It's special board.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All books are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes. Some are missing from the Seventh Canto, but most are here. Here is <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> And if you have books you need, they can go down here, your reference books. I got you this little box here if you want to keep anything special. They used to make things for the princes. This is comfortable seat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Table is close enough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, everything is comfortable. These stones are not available in India. Maybe very costly. Italian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> This is from Portugal. The white is from Italy. They have put the different marbles together, very expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Combination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They have also made your <span class="Italic">Vyāsasana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one. So this side, marble is cheaper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes, it's very..., it's not expensive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. They have done very nice this furniture. We cannot expect this furniture in India. They may make, but it will be very costly. (coughs) You bring one spittoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many devotees are there?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. They are all happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them come and work little, grow food, eat and chant. Why should they bother going to the factory, running at five o'clock? Horrible life, horrible civilization? Motor accident, delayed, anxiety, "Oh, I am delayed, I am delayed." What is this civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He is taking over there, you take here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, I shall begin there. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
