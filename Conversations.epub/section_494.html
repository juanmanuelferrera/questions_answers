<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Theory? Theory of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Knowledge. Ways to approach nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your decision? What is the position of the living entities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> (translating) She says she's... They're more or less concerned with the theory of knowledge, rather than actually having some knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that theory of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes. I had been studying the Sanskrit, the texts of Śaṅkara especially, the <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> of Badarāyaṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, theory of knowledge, how it is explained? Every living being has got knowledge. What is that theory of knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every individual being has knowledge. Even a small ant, it has got knowledge. Knowledge... Of course, development of knowledge according to the body, but a living entity, even the trees, they have got knowledge. They grow... When there is some block, they do not grow that side; they grow this side. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So every living being has got knowledge. The basic knowledge, how to maintain, every one has got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, knowledge... Living entity, by constitutional position, has got knowledge, but in connection with this material world, when this living entity comes to this material world, so according to the body, the development of knowledge differs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> If one is following different stage, status of knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Different stage of knowledge means different types of body. Just like a child. A child is talking in some way. The same child, when he will get a different body, youthful body, he'll talk differently. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (German Man):</span> I would like to ask you a question. Once Leibnitz, who is one of the fathers of the Western tradition, formulated the question which was the beginning of metaphysics in a way, Western metaphysics. The question is "Why there is anything?" What is your stand about this classic point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Why there is anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Why anything exists? What is the reason for the existence of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) "Why anything exists?" (laughter) What do you mean by anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, that's precisely the point. What is the purpose? What is the sense, if there is any, or does the very question make sense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, unless understand what is that "anything..." First of all, you have to understand what is that "anything." Anything... Just like this book, this table, this bell, the electric they are so many things. So you can take any one of them; that is anything. What is your idea of anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Oh, reality. Material, external, reality to our ego, our internal reality as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Internal reality and external reality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Both. For me, the word "anything" covers both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that also we understand, "anything." There are so many varieties of things, and you can take any one of them. That is "anything." But your question should be, "Wherefrom these things coming?" That should be the proper question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> What is the reason of this (indistinct) "anything"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are so many things, and you can take any one of them. That is "anything." But the real question should be "Wherefrom all these things are coming?" That is real question, "What is the origin of all these things?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, origin, that is more on the theoretical side. It's a question, "Why?" But I am, rather, after the purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is a nice question. But there is the real source of everything. That is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra...</span> Perhaps you have read. <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> first question is: "Wherefrom all these things come?" So the answer is that <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> "Brahmān. The original thing is Brahmān, or the Absolute Truth, and from Him, everything is emanating." Just like physical... The sun is there, and whole material world is product of the sunshine. What your physical science says? Eh? Eh? Do they not say? It is a fact that sunshine... Due to the sunshine all these material things are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, it's more involved than just saying that. Sun is just a big complex of hydrogen and helium, a big pile of rubbish really, but it develops this marvelous reactions which causes it to work as a big nuclear reactor, an entirely different story, what the vision of science, of the present science, about the meaning of celestial bodies and the meaning of, in particular, of sun and moon and so on. We are extremely realistic about this world. We can't see, assuming all the glory of that what happens on the earth due to the existence of those bodies, we do not try to look inside of the structure of these things, as something meant for us. Just universe as it is... And this question, like Nietzchean question which I am repeating-that's not my point-this big question is... Western philosophy presently does not answer, does not ask this question. I think that this scientist who did ask it had quite a point. This question expresses the quest of the human race for some meaning for some sense, for some sense. That's what religion is now offering us, or philosophy, or... Rarely, directly, we hear the direct answer to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your direct answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Oh, I don't have any. If I would have, I wouldn't ask you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means your knowledge is insufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Precisely. Precisely. That is the beginning of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, if you have no answer. That's all right. That "We don't know" means our knowledge is insufficient. But knowledge means must be progressive. We should not remain in insufficient knowledge. We must make further progress to get sufficient knowledge. Inquiry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But you referred to some other, more direct ways of acquiring knowledge than just the standard...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because we have got insufficient knowledge, we cannot approach directly. It is not possible. We have to take knowledge-who has got sufficient knowledge, from him. Because you have got insufficient knowledge, so you cannot make progress. Just like beyond this wall, you cannot say what is there. That is insufficient knowledge. But that does not mean there is nothing. Because you cannot say what is beyond this wall, that does not mean that there is nothing beyond this wall. Your knowledge is insufficient. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But this was more or less my question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try to hear. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> If Indian philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is no Indian or American. It is the philosophy. It is philosophy. The philosophy is not Indian or American. Truth is truth, not Indian truth or American truth. That is not truth. That is relative truth. The Absolute Truth is absolute. That is neither Indian nor American nor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But in what sense you use the concept "truth" here? Is it in the ontological sense, or is it in somehow in a more pragmatical human sense, refers to human beings or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is pragmatic, that you cannot see beyond this wall. That is your insufficient knowledge or your senses are insufficient. You cannot go beyond this wall. But that does not mean there is nothing beyond this wall. So if you want to know what is beyond this wall, you have to know from a person who knows it. Yes. Because you cannot see, you cannot know, that is not the end. There must be something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? It is actual fact. That is pragmatic. It is actual fact. There is... So many things there are, but you do not know because your senses are imperfect. Your eyes are imperfect, your touch, imperfect, the gathering senses... The senses which gathers knowledge... Just like eyes... We can see and gather knowledge. We can hear; we gather knowledge. We can taste; we gather knowledge. So, because your senses are imperfect, therefore your knowledge gathered, that is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But in the case of a mystical man that has been able to see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of mystic. First of all we have to admit that on account of our senses being imperfect, whatever knowledge we gather, that is imperfect. That is imperfect. Therefore, if you want to possess real knowledge you have to approach somebody who is perfect. You cannot... Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How can we know that somebody is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. But first of all, the basic principle is we have to understand that our senses are imperfect, and whatever knowledge we gather by these imperfect senses, they are imperfect. So if we want perfect knowledge, then we have to approach somebody whose senses are perfect, whose knowledge is perfect. That is the principle. That is the Vedic principle. Therefore the Vedic principle says, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> You know Sanskrit, yes. "In order to know that perfect knowledge, one should approach guru." So who is guru? Then the next question will be... Your question is that, "How I can?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How can I know that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am coming. That I am coming. Guru... That is next line. It is said, <span class="Italic">śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham.</span> Guru means who has properly heard the <span class="Italic">Vedas, śruti. Śrotriyam.</span> And as a result of his hearing he is firmly convinced in the existence of the Absolute Truth, God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Well, this is... We've only come to one of the mentioned(?) theories of knowledge, I think, <span class="Italic">śabda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sata? Śabda,</span> yes, <span class="Italic">śabda-brahman.</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Then if you are able to communicate to heart with knowledge through <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śabda-brahman.</span> Just like many thousands of miles away we are getting some radio message and we learn that "Something is happening there. Something is there." Therefore <span class="Italic">śabda.</span> This is... <span class="Italic">Śabda</span> means sound, sound, sound vibration. So that is the real source of knowledge. That is the real source of... <span class="Italic">Śabda-brahman.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> One of the sources of knowledge or the only one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is the only one. There are others; they are subordinate. But the <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> knowledge received, <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> through <span class="Italic">śabda, śabda-brahman,</span> that is perfect knowledge. Just like the same example: beyond this wall I cannot see, but if somebody there says, "This is the position here"-the sound comes-that is perfect. You cannot see what is going on, but if somebody says, sends radio message or any message, sound, then you know. Therefore <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa, śabda,</span> knowledge received through <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> that is perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That means through <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> and through other means you can have a direct intuition but you can't intact... Direct intuition of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Intuition is different. Direct perception. <span class="Italic">Śabda,</span> you can (have) direct perception. It is not intuition. It is perception. Therefore the word is used, <span class="Italic">śrotriyam brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> So our process is to receive knowledge through <span class="Italic">śabda-brahman,</span> Vedic. Just like <span class="Italic">eko nārāyaṇa asit. Eko nārāyaṇa asit:</span> "Before creation there was only Nārāyaṇa." <span class="Italic">Na brahmā na īśaḥ:</span> "There was no Brahmā; there was no Śiva." So this is <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa, śabda-pramāṇa,</span> that "In the beginning there was God, nothing else." So in this way our Vedic principle is: when your knowledge is corroborated by the Vedic version then it is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But according to Śaṅkara it is not only way that you can approach truth. You can also approach through deduction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many ways. Just like hypothesis. Hypothesis. Yes. History, history. Hypothesis, history. Then direct perception. There are many. But of all these, <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa</span> is taken as best. <span class="Italic">Śabda-pramāṇa,</span> evidence through the sound. That is the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, but (indistinct). According to (indistinct). If one comes to value, existential value of a thing, through deduction... Is it possible or not only through intuition, through direct intuition of the reality of the whole?(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Value by intuition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Direct knowledge of the existence of a thing, of anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The knowledge of existence, that <span class="Italic">nityaḥ-śāśvato 'yam, nityaḥ ṣāṣvataḥ,</span> that is knowledge of existence. So you have to learn which is <span class="Italic">nitya</span> and which is not <span class="Italic">nitya</span> from the authority. "This is <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> and this is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span>" So <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the Vedic version: "There is one chief <span class="Italic">nitya</span> amongst the many <span class="Italic">nityas.</span>" Just like we, we living entities, we are <span class="Italic">nityas,</span> eternal. First of all try to understand eternity. You were a child or I was a child. Now that body, child body, is no longer existing. But I understand, I know, that I had a body, child. Therefore I am <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> I am existing. The body has gone, but I am existing. Therefore I am eternal, <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> Is it clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Well, I remember one other explanation, that when you are sleeping and you have a dream...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when I am sleeping I am working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> ...and you have a dream, and then, when you are coming back from sleep...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> ...you can remember your dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That means that you are conscious of your existence even on the suppression of consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not only conscious, but the consciousness depends on me. Because I am there, therefore consciousness... So I am <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> This is the proof of <span class="Italic">nitya,</span> that many changes have taken place, but the changes, the phenomenal changes, they have gone out. They are no more existing. Therefore they are not <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> Just like dream. At night I saw one dream, but the dream is no more existing, but I remember that last night I saw the dream. Therefore I am <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> And the dream is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span> The dream is <span class="Italic">anitya.</span> Similarly, this phenomenal world, when I am not sleeping, but I am so-called awakened, so I am seeing. I am seeing you, I am seeing the table, this book, you see, but... (aside:) Don't... But when I am asleep I forget all these things. I forget. I am in a different world. I am seeing different things. So this is also dream, and the dream at night, that is also dream. But I, the seer of this dream and that dream, I am the eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> The thing is not to make dependent on the conscious of any individual the existence of thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Existence of thing... I say that at night, when I am dreaming, I do not see existence of these things. And at this time, in daytime, when I am seeing these things, I do not see the existence of the dream. So the conclusion should be both these things I see in daytime and I see at night, they have no existence. They are phenomenal. But I am the seer; I am eternal. I am existing. This is the proof. Because at night I am seeing and daytime I am seeing, so therefore I am eternal. But the phenomenal manifestation, they are temporary. We don't say it is false. Temporary. The Māyāvādī philo... Śaṅkara said it is false. <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā. Mithyā</span> means false. We don't say false. We don't say that this book is false. It has got reality, but temporary. This book has come into form at a certain date, and it will exist for certain days, and when it will be worn out or old, there will be no existence. Therefore the formation of this book is temporary. But I am the reader of the book; I am eternal. So two things are there, temporary and eternal. The temporary existence, somebody says, "False," but we say, "It is not false; it is temporary." But there is an eternal existence. Just like I am eternal. That is... We have to learn from <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> vibration. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> You understand Sanskrit. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> That eternal thing is existing, it will continue to exist. Even after the destruction of this temporary body, it will continue to exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But coming again to the question that Professor (indistinct) put to you, but it is possible to understand all those things (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to understand... I have already said that we have got our imperfect senses. We cannot understand. But we have to understand from a person who has got perfect knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But why existence of all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So? Why? Then the answer will be: "Why there shall not be existence?" First of all you answer this. If you question like that-"Why there is existence?"-then I shall inquire, "Why there shall not be existence?" Therefore the decision should be taken from the Absolute. Your question, my answer, will not solve. If you say, "Why there is existence?" I can ask you, "Why there shall not be existence?" And who will decide this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> If I may something, this basic question, I suppose, may be asked only on the level of all religion, all philosophy, which does not put a line of division between practice in life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...and abstract investigations. Now, in normal Western thinking we do deny the very purpose of that question. As a matter of fact, we never ask it. Since time when Leibnitz did ask this question we all forgot it, or deliberately we suppress it. We simply say, "All right, let's be concerned only with those things which we can deal with effectively in material world. And the question of purpose let's leave aside." Now, I suppose that within this system of thought which you have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may tell you two things. The purpose is... That is experienced by every one of us, what is the purpose of life, what is the purpose, anything. That, everyone, we can understand very easily. The purpose is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Pleasure. That is the purpose. There is no difficulty to understand what is the purpose. The purpose is pleasure-seeking. Or purpose is pleasure. One who hasn't got the pleasure, he's seeking after it. That is the purpose. Purpose is <span class="Italic">ānanda. Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> Everyone of us, seeking <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> The scientific knowledge, philosophy, or even driving the car or whatever you are doing-the purpose is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> That is a common factor. Purpose is... Why I am eating palatable dishes? I can eat anything, but I am seeking that "This sort of foodstuff will please me." That is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is driving force and motivation of most human activities. But the question, purpose, which Leibnitz was asking for, he was asking on higher plane, in abstraction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Higher plane means you are seeking after pleasure, but that is being obstructed. That is your position. You are seeking pleasure, but it is not unobstructed. Therefore you are seeking higher, where there is no obstruction. Pleasure is the purpose, but when you speak of higher plane, that means you are experiencing obstruction in getting pleasure. So you are seeking a platform where there is no obstruction. But the purpose is the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Must it necessarily be so? That would be so, supposing that we human beings are at the center of existence, and our criteria should be applied, measuring everything which exists. Now, the question, "Why there is anything?" is asked on the more higher level, in the sense, trying to forget about this answer for anthropocentric thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> This question relates to everything what may exist, other beings, other intelligences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a fact, that intelligent or not intelligent, that doesn't matter. Everyone is seeking pleasure, <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> The Sanskrit word is <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> So <span class="Italic">ānanda...</span> Suppose I am constructing a big house to live there, but before the construction is finished I am, by nature, I am taken away. I die. Just like Napoleon. That, in France, that Arc in Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Arc de Triumph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He could not finish. You see? There are so many things. We are thinking, "By finishing this, we shall be happy," but that is sometimes hampered. So <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is checked. So this is the position. So higher means where <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is not checked. That is higher position. The purpose is <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> but in this material world we are experiencing <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> being checked. Just like nobody wants to die. That's a fact. Why you shall die? I already discussed that I know that I was a child, I was a boy, I was a young man, and now I have got this body, old man's body. It is now going to finish. So I am little anxious. Now, whatever <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> I was drawing in my living condition, now it is going to be finished. But if we think properly that "I am eternal, so although the body will be finished, I'll not be finished..." This is very natural, that "I was not finished. Because my childhood body was finished, so I was not finished. My boyhood body was not finished; I was not finished. My youthhood was finished, but I was not finished." Similarly, the conclusion should be: "Even though this body will be finished, I'll not be finished." That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">. Dhīra,</span> one who is intelligent, he is not disturbed. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati.</span> So <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> one who is <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> sober, philosopher, he knows that "I am not going to be finished. I shall have to accept another body." Now, whether that body will be <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span> That is the consideration. I'll get another body, just like I have got this body, after changing so many bodies. Moment after moment, we are changing body. That is the medical science, changing of blood corpuscles. So this body will be changed again. Then I will have to enter the mother's womb and packed up for at least ten months in suffocated condition. This is scientific, all. Then again I'll come out when the body is prepared nicely to come out and exist. So that period of formation of body is not <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> To remain compact in this way for ten months, it is not <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> It is not <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> just opposite <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Then when we die... Die, death, means the miserable condition is so great that we cannot live. We have to go out. There is no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Then, when we have got this body, changing, there is no <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> because we are sometimes diseased, and to become old man, that is also not <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Therefore I am eternal. I am seeking after something which is eternal <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Therefore next consideration should be that "Whether this condition of repetition of birth, death, old age and disease can be changed?" That is next question. And if there is possibility, then we shall try for it. But there is possibility here. The conclusion is: so long we get this material body... Because matter is not eternal. Anything you take, material-earth, water, fire, air, sky, mind, intelligence and false ego-these are all material things. So these material things, they are not eternal, none of them. This table is created; it is not eternal. It will be finished at a certain date, anything you take. But I am eternal. So if I transfer myself in another nature which is eternal, then my <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> will be eternal. That is the purpose of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, but the point is the identity between <span class="Italic">ātmān</span> and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> You are <span class="Italic">ātmā. Ātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> ...the <span class="Italic">ātman</span> of the world, let's say, absolute...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and Paramātmā, Paramātmā. As I was speaking, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānām.</span> We are all <span class="Italic">nityas,</span> eternal, but there is one chief <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> Just like leader. Everywhere we go, we have got a leader. Now, this, your Mexico state, there is a president. You cannot avoid it. In your college there is principal. There must be a leader. Similarly, the whole thing taken together, there must be one leader. You have to speak from experience that in your physical department or in your religious department there is a chief, leader, professor. Or you may be. But that is the way. Therefore Vedic information is that we are eternal, but there is another eternal who is chief eternal. That is God. He is eternal; we are also eternal. Then what is difference? The difference is that <span class="Italic">eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān:</span> "That one eternal, chief eternal, He is maintaining all the subordinate eternals." So both eternals are eternal and... The purpose is pleasure. Just like a small example, a family man. The father is the chief man in the family. The mother is there, the children are there, all together. But the father is the chief man in the family. He is maintaining the family, and there is <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> pleasure. Similarly, <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is the aim of both, all the eternals, the chief eternal or the subordinate eternal. But the supplier is the chief eternal. So when we come together, the chief eternal and the subordinate eternals, and enjoy together, that is the purpose of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> According to existential philosophy or Indian philosophy, like for instance the Ramakrishna and Vivekananda and all that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not philosopher. They have no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I think you are also supporting the possibility to acquire knowledge through contact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our position is-I have already explained-that we are all imperfect. Therefore we have to take knowledge from the perfect. So God is perfect, or Kṛṣṇa is perfect, so we have to receive knowledge from Him. Then our knowledge is perfect. And so long we shall speculate, that is not perfect because you are speculating with imperfect instruments, what is the use? If I want to cut this table, I must have proper instrument. If I want to cut this table with this book, "Let me cut this," how it will be possible? You must know that for cutting this table it requires this instrument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, they say that the only way to acquire knowledge is through <span class="Italic">śabda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śabda-pramāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> And I think other <span class="Italic">pramāṇas</span> will be also possible according to those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like I am trying something, and some experienced man says, "Do like this." This is <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa.</span> The <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa,</span> one who knows, he says, "Do like this." The "Do like this," means <span class="Italic">śabda,</span> sound, and it enters your ear, and you do adjustment. Therefore <span class="Italic">śabda-pramāṇa.</span> Just like you are sleeping, and one is, another man is coming to kill you. And another friend says, "Get up, get up, get up! There is enemy. He is coming to kill you." Then you wake up. Therefore the sound is the <span class="Italic">pramāṇa,</span> there was enemy. These are crude examples. When you are asleep, you cannot understand. You have got eyes, you have got hands, you have legs but no experience, but the ear gives you warning even if you are sleeping. There is enemy, your eyes cannot see, your hand cannot touch, but the ear can give you evidence, "Yes." As soon as you are awakened you say, "Yes, here is enemy. He is coming to kill me." Therefore the aural reception, sound reception, is the evidence. Knowledge received through authentic sound vibration, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Let's just say I would like to ask a question in this way. We don't doubt what you said, the assumption that individual ego is eternal and also subordinate to that which is eternal, hierarchically higher, nevertheless is the part of that which is the eternal reality. And that is (indistinct) that which you later developed. Question, sir: Is this statement what you made, a statement of fact based on direct perception, or it is something what follows traditional belief and is just the axiomatic basis of your philosophy or similar other philosophies of axiomatic basis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is axiomatic basis because you have to accept that your senses are imperfect. So you, by speculation, cannot have perfect knowledge. This is axiomatic truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> With that epistemological truth, all right we may go along, and, as a matter of fact, doubt about the truths of direct sensual perception is the basis, one of models of scientific activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Direct perception...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> My question is, rather, this statement, this basic statement about eternal ego and so on, is a statement which you somehow give to us as revealed message, something what is...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, revealed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> ...or is...? Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Revealed. It is revealed. Hm? Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the vibration is coming from Kṛṣṇa. Now, you practically realize it: "Yes, what is said is correct." That is direct perception. First of all, you receive the message, and then apply your logic and see that it is fact. Therefore it is perfect. When you receive the knowledge and when you directly apply it to your perception, when you see it is correct, that is the proof that the message which you received, that is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Very difficult to have proofs of that, where the eternality of your own <span class="Italic">ātman</span> for instance, things of that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called realization. Yes. First of all you receive the sound, then apply your instruments, and when you find it, it is correct-that is the realization. So our process is to receive knowledge from the perfect. That's all. We are not perfect. But the knowledge we are getting, that is perfect. So according to that perfect direction, if we mold our life, then we are successful. Otherwise you go on experimenting, speculating. <span class="Italic">Ciraṁ vicinvan. Ciram,</span> you understand, "perpetually," <span class="Italic">vicinvan,</span> "thinking." <span class="Italic">Ciraṁ vicinvan.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">athāpi te deva padāmbuja-dvaya-<br class="calibre2"/>prasāda-leśānugṛhīta eva hi<br class="calibre2"/>jānāti tattvaṁ (bhagavan mahimno)<br class="calibre2"/>na cānya eko 'pi ciraṁ vicinvan<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 10.14.29]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">What is the use of speculating with imperfect senses? Useless waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is the tendency of modern... They do not accept that their senses are imperfect. They want to see something, distant place, with microscope... What is called? Telescope. Telescope. But the telescope is manufactured by you. It is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But I would say that even in India, where ancient tradition... They would propose how to arrange our telescopes to be able to see more correctly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to see... That... Vedic injunction says, <span class="Italic">śāstra-cakśuṣā. Śāstra-cakśuṣā:</span> "Your eyes should be the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span>" There is another crude example. Just like who is your father? How do you understand? Through the vibration of the mother. The mother says, "He is your father." You accept it. Otherwise there is no experiment. So things which are beyond your perception, beyond your defective senses, that should not be speculated. <span class="Italic">Na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet. Acintyā khalv ye bhāvā na tāṁs tarkeṇa yojayet.</span> These are the injunction. What is beyond your perception, beyond your speculation, don't waste your time so-called argument and logic. What is argument? Mother says, "He is your father." Where is the argument? You cannot apply any argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> No, I said old tradition in India has been going on into argument itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, argument you can go on, but if you want to know the truth it will not be attained by argument because argument is also within your thinking power: thinking, feeling, willing. So if your thinking, feeling, willing is imperfect, what is the use of your argument? What is the use of your so-called advancement of knowledge? Basically, if the senses, knowledge acquiring senses, are imperfect, then how you can get perfect knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Well, then what do we with all techniques, all systems, that have been developed? I am thinking only India, I am not thinking other places, and all the old tradition, since Śaṅkara onwards, of different ways to think, to study, to go deeply to all these relations between...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkara has interpreted. Śaṅkara has interpreted by his limited knowledge. So that is not perfect knowledge. Therefore we don't accept Śaṅkara's philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But I said if he belongs to the same tradition, and you belong to the other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That tradition is nothing. Tradition is just temporary. You make your tradition; he makes your tradition. That is another thing. But the, fact is fact. That is not dependent on tradition. Tradition we can make, tradition. "We believe." Just like somebody says, "We believe." What is the use of such saying, "We believe"? You may believe something which is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Yes, but we could say that since the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and later, all things have been sustaining the thing which you have just said a moment ago, that there exists an identity between <span class="Italic">ātman</span> and Brahmān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Identity is there. That, therefore, I have already said, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānṁ.</span> Both of them are identical so far <span class="Italic">nitya</span> is concerned or <span class="Italic">cetana</span> is concerned, but one is dependent, and other is maintainer. That is difference. Both of them are truth. Both of them truth. You are truth; I am truth. You are living; I am living, existing. This is truth. This is truth, but you are professor and I am something else. That is temporary. But so far you are, as living being, and I am, as living being, that is truth. But your dress and my dress, that is temporary. So we have to understand like that. In this material world we are mixed up with temporary and eternal. The living entity is eternal, but his body is temporary. This is the position. So the problem is: why the eternal has got temporary things? That is hampering his <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Just like I am sitting here. Now, if somebody says, "Now you'll have to die and accept another body," this is not very pleasing to me. Or even I am sitting in this apartment, and somebody..., "No, you change your apartment. Come. Come here." Again I change another apartment. So I'll seek after: "Why I am changing this apartment? Is it not possible to get an eternal apartment?" That should be the <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsā.</span> That is... <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> first says, <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> "Why I am subjected to this change?" That is intelligence. "Why not eternal apartment if I am eternal?" That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Did you say that for the <span class="Italic">ātman,</span> are part of the eternal? For the <span class="Italic">ātman,</span> it is... A need for the being is for the purpose, <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ānanda,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> That means he is inquiring...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature, nature <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> This other thing, they have it because of <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> pleasure, playing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Just like somebody goes within the water. Nowadays it has become a fashion. What is that? Go within the water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Diving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not belong to the water, but he takes some pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> He needs the pleasure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore he's seeking pleasure. That is the real aim. Therefore he's going into the water. He has no business to go to the water, but because he is seeking pleasure-"Let me see if there is some pleasure. Experiment." That's all. But he does not get... Just like they are going to the moon planet, moon planet: "Let us see." Because there is no <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> he is seeking another type of <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> And now they have failed. Now they're going to Venus or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mars. This is going on. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's not seeking after where is eternal happiness. He's... Temporarily, he's seeking here, there. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate.</span> In this way his life is finished, seeking <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> and he gets another body, another term. So his intelligence is not coming to the point that "What is this <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span> I am eternal. I am seeking eternal <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Why this <span class="Italic">ānanda?</span> Sometimes this body, sometimes this position, sometimes that position-what is this?" That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I understand it very well from the point of view of particular individual and <span class="Italic">ātman...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Individual, we are part and parcel. The same thing: the supreme eternal, and we, means subordinate eternal. We are of the same quality. Quality is the same but quantity different. Therefore our knowledge quantity and his knowledge quantity different. Therefore we should take knowledge from Him, who has large quantity of knowledge. We have got tiny quantity of... This is the difference. He is also cognizant, I am also cognizant, but his knowledge is vast, unlimited; my knowledge is tiny. Therefore, if I want to know more, we should know from Him. That is perfect knowledge. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārtham sa gurum evābhigacchet śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> May I ask a personal question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I heard that you were a chemist before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was not chemist, but I was manager in a big chemical factory. Therefore, automatically, I learned something of chemist. And later on I started my own chemical factory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> You were belonging to Bengal?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. He is my guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> But you are of the same line of Puruṣottama Sarasvatī, the great philosopher, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Puruṣottama Sarasvatī? No, my Guru Mahārāja was Sarasvatī, Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Oh, Bhakti... So that's the same line, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That receiving the perfect knowledge... There is <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> Just like I have got perfect knowledge. I tell you. Then you get the perfect knowledge. You tell him. This is called <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> I read something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Evam paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> Without that <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> the knowledge is not perfect.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have traveled all over the world in eight years. Eight years? From 1967, eight years. So eight years I have traveled around fourteen times or more than that. No, twice in a year, almost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this time, I started from India. Then I went to Hong Kong, from Hong Kong to Tokyo, from Tokyo to Honolulu, from Honolulu to Los Angeles, and from Los Angeles here, Mexico. And then where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Caracas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caracas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And then Puerto Rico. Then Miami, Atlanta, New York, London.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then, from London, I may go directly to Bombay, or I may visit some other European cities where we have got temple. In Paris, in Geneva, in Rome, in Amsterdam, we have got some temple, like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> What you're going to do about...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen all our books? These are our books.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> If music is important to us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, our basic principle is pleasure. So whatever gives pleasure, we accept. That is natural. But in the material world, they take material pleasure, but we are for spiritual pleasure. So as soon as we speak of pleasure, there must be varieties. Without... Variety is the mother of enjoyment. So the only thing is that the material pleasure, that is temporary. It is finished after certain period, and spiritual means eternal. So our endeavor is to transfer ourself from this material pleasure to the spiritual pleasure. But the pleasure is the aim, either in this material world or in the spiritual world. This is... <span class="Italic">Ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the Vedic... Our position is <span class="Italic">ānandamaya,</span> to remain in pleasure. But here in this material world, the body is temporary, and everything is temporary. Therefore pleasure is temporary.</div>

Of course, we are limited by, all time by biological limitation and so on. But this statement, that there is perfect knowledge, that it can be acquired, and that there are some people who did acquire it, that's very strong statement indeed, and my question is of the practical nature.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already said, that you take the vibration from the Vedic knowledge and you experiment it.

You must be expert. But it is... In our <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> you'll find that there is a statement, <span class="Italic">caitanyera dayāra kathā karaha vicāra:</span> "Just try to make an experiment on the mercy of Lord Caitanya." <span class="Italic">Vicāra karile citte pabe camatkāra:</span> "When you make an experiment, then you'll be awe-full 'Oh, it is so nice.' " So it is not to be accepted blindly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor:</span> Can one perceive by their own senses what is that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to see through the eyes of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> but God has given you the instrument by which you can make an experiment. Yes. The same thing, as it is stated... Find out that verse from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> [break] This is the statement. Now you make experiment. You have got physical laboratory. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It would be rather difficult, I'm afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you must know the, how it can be experiment. It is given. The example is given that... What is that? "As the child is passing"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "As the embodied soul continually passes in this body from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Now, this is a fact. Everyone knows that body is changing. Now, how the last body's changed? That you make experiment, how it is passing. Yes. To make experiment means you have to know the science how to make experiment. That is knowledge. You take the basic principle of knowledge, and then you make your experiment and you will know this is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Is there any direct line of division between that which you would call knowledge and that what you call religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion, as it is passing on at the present moment, "a kind of faith," this is not religion. This is not religion. According to... Religion means <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> the characteristic. Just like you are eating something salty, something sweet. So the sugar, the characteristic, it is sweet. That is religion. And the salt is salty. The chili is pungent. So these characteristic is religion. So you'll have to find out religion, what is your real characteristic. That is religion. Now, religion is going, "I believe in this way." That is another thing, sentiment. Religion without philosophy is sentiment, and philosophy without religion, mental speculation. Those two things must be combined, philosophy and sentiment. Then it is religion. (end)</div>
