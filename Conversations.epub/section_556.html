<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I understood that you approach psychiatry, psychology, from the point of eastern philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what can I do for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychiatrist:</span> I have no question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has no question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, what shall I say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I don't know, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He had told me that he has read your <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He has a copy. Do you have any questions about the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Has he understood it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Psychiatrist:</span> I just wished to meet you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says he just wished to meet you. Perhaps I should read a verse. Should I read a verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our viewpoint is that in the material world, who has accepted this material body-anyone, but we specially take the human society-they require treatment, everyone. Everyone is mentally diseased, and therefore he is unhappy. Everyone. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahād-guṇa</span> [SB 5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Anyone who has no sense of God consciousness, he is diseased mentally. He requires treatment. The whole human society, especially at the present moment, they have given up God consciousness. They are not interested. That is their disease. And everyone requires treatment. So the whole Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the mass treatment of the materialistic persons who are mentally diseased. That is our proposition. It is... In India there was a case. A man committed murder, and he pleaded in the court that... His pleader, his lawyer, pleaded that he was mad at that time. We also accept unless one becomes mad, one cannot commit murder or suicide. So the civil surgeon was brought to give evidence whether this man is actually mad. The civil surgeon said that "So far my experience is concerned-I have treated so many persons-in my opinion everyone is mad. So if on account of madness one should be excused from the law, then it is Your Honor's discretion, but so far I have studied, more or less, everyone is mad." Similarly, our study is that unless one is mad, he cannot remain in this material world. So everyone is mentally diseased, and they are concocting their ideas, different ideas. And they are overlapping, my idea, your idea overlapping. Therefore there is clash, unhappiness, violence, individually, socially, familywise, nationwise. This is going on. Therefore everyone requires a treatment, psychiatrist's treatment. And the best treatment is to induce a person to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then everything will be all right. Otherwise, a person who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, or God conscious, he is basically a mad man and requires treatment. (pause) Ghostly haunted man... You have experienced ghostly haunted man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In Woodsaw (?) there was a ghost. In St. Kilda the devotees used to think there was a ghost, but not a man who was called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is ghost. And sometimes ghost attacks a man. Because he has no material body, he wants to act through other's body. So the man who is attacked, he forgets himself, and he speaks and walks according to the dictation of the ghost. That is called ghostly haunted man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> What is the significance of... What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He talks nonsense. Suppose his father comes before him, he calls him by ill names, like that. He talks nonsense. So anyone who is too much materially affected, he also talks nonsense. <span class="Italic">Anartha upāsamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje.</span> The treatment is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> That we are teaching. Without any exception, we accept everyone a patient for psychiatric treatment. He has this book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then all other books we can show him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, does the soul, the ghost, enter into the other man's body? The soul is occupying one body, and the ghost, as another soul, does he enter that body? There's two souls in the one body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not exactly enters, but he catches the body. But because the ghost has no gross body-he has got his subtle body, mind, intelligence, and ego-you cannot see him, how he has attacked that body. You cannot see the body of mind, intelligence. You know I have got my mind; I know you have got your mind. But you do not see my mind; I do not see your mind. So ghost is within the subtle body: mind, intelligence, and ego. So with that subtle body, he attacks the man, but you cannot see. He does not enter into him. The enter is the soul within the body. Therefore sometimes ghost is walking in the room. We cannot see. But he takes away something. We see that the thing is going away. (laughter) Because you cannot see his gross body. And because he hasn't got gross body, he can move very swiftly. Now he is here; he can go ten miles away immediately. But there is ghost. And they attack specially woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is that because the women are weaker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Woman is attractive for any man, even in ghostly life. The other day, who was telling that a big poet of India, he said that "God's most wonderful creation is woman's body"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I think Brahmānanda Mahārāja mentioned? Acyutānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, everyone is attracted with the woman's body. In your country I have seen the advertisement: "bottomless," "topless..." That is the material attraction. Everyone is in this material world on account of attachment. And similarly, for woman, the man's body is beautiful. So in this way both of them are attached to one another. That is the basic principle of material life. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> They become attached. On account of sex life, they become more attached, and therefore both of them remain almost perpetually in this material world, and to satisfy different desires they transmigrate from one body to another. And on account of accepting this material body, there is always miserable condition. Therefore everyone requires the psychiatric treatment so that the mind may be transferred from matter to spirit soul. Then he will be cured. The disease is of the mind. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasy kuto mahād-guṇa mano-rathena.</span> Everyone is riding on the chariot of mind. And the mind is taking him here and there, here... And the yoga practice is also treatment. This is also yoga, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> and this ordinary <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga,</span> that is also treatment of the mind. Treatment of mind means controlling the senses. <span class="Italic">Yoga indriya-samyamaḥ.</span> Mind is the leader of the senses. So if the treatment of the mind is done properly, then the senses work properly. The example is the madman. Because the madman's mind is not controlled, he is acting in a way-people say, "Here is a madman." So everyone is more or less a madman in this material world, or, in other words, you can say anyone who is in the material world, he is a madman. He requires treatment. Just like anyone who is in the prison house, it is to be accepted that he is a criminal. Without any study, without any exception we can accept all the prisoners as criminals. [break] ...gradually appreciate. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanaṁ [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> This treatment is in the beginning just cleansing the mirror of the heart. That is the treatment. Just like a mirror, when it is overcast with dust, it requires cleansing. So the mental mirror is covered with material dust. So it has to be cleansed. That is the treatment. And when it is cleansed, you can see your real face in the mirror. Similarly, as soon as our heart disease, contaminated by the modes of material nature, is cleansed, you can understand what is your real position. That is the success of psychiatric treatment. One comes to know, "What I am." <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi:</span> "I am spirit soul; I am not this body." That is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> stage. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> He becomes immediately happy. And happiness means <span class="Italic">na śocati na kāṅkṣati:</span> "He does not lament, neither he desires." Our present disease is we hanker after things which we do not possess, and when that thing is lost, we lament. So hankering and lamenting. So when one is cleansed in the heart, he has no more hankering or desire. This is the symptom. And <span class="Italic">samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu:</span> "Then he becomes equal to everyone." Everyone means every living being, man and animal, trees, plants, lower or higher. <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ [Bg. </span>5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he enters into the sphere of devotional service. This is the symptom. Then he is perfectly in his original position. Then he is happy. Just like a diseased man. So long the disease is there, he is unhappy. And as soon as the disease is cured, he will be happy. So this material disease, as soon as it is cured, one becomes happy, because he is, by constitution, spiritual being. People have no knowledge even, his..., even about his spiritual identity. Therefore they are unhappy. So if you forget what you have written, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Do you remember what you wrote about, which part? About Kṛṣṇa's birth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's birth? But in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Maybe he means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> I've read that in (indistinct) and in other books in Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He said he read in some other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> I've been reading about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says he's read many books about Kṛṣṇa in Hindi also. But maybe he means Chapter Four, verse six, where Kṛṣṇa says He comes again in this world in His original form. Do you have any questions about Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Actually, I want to know how could I get more involved in, say, in religion, and... Want to become a truer devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa, you know, sacrifice myself really. How could I be one of pure devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He wants to know how to become a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You live with us and you will become pure devotee. They are pure devotees. You live with them and do whatever they are doing, their examples, and you will become pure devotee. Just like in a workshop, if you admit yourself without any knowledge, if you work with the workshop man, gradually you will learn how to work. It is not difficult. Formerly this was the custom in India, that when somebody sends his son to any workshop or any shopkeeper without any pay, so gradually he learns. And the master says, "Now I engage you with some pay." That is the way. <span class="Italic">Sataṁ prasaṅgāt.</span> By living with devotees, you'll learn devotion. So if you are serious, you are welcome. You can live with us and behave according to the other devotees. Then he's a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Is it possible that I live on my own and still be a devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will take long time. That, also, if you follow the regulative principles... It is difficult, little. But easier method is to live with the devotees because the situation and atmosphere in your home is different from devotion. So it is not very helpful. You have got other members in the family?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Yes, there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you want to do something, they may not like it. So that is impediment. But if you live with the devotees, then you learn quickly the art. You are Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom you are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> I was born in New Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. How you came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Well, my parents moved to Fiji Islands, and I was with them. And then we all came to Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She is also Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom you are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian girl:</span> My parents were born in India and I was brought up in Fiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are in Fiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian girl:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian girl:</span> My mother's in Australia and my father's in Fiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So where are your parents? Where they are, your parents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian girl:</span> They are separated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> She says they're separated. One lives in Sydney and one lives in Fiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Fiji there are many Indians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Yes, there are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The language is in Hindi? Fiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Indians speak Hindi, Fijians they speak Fijian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fijians they are Europeans? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are natives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Natives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are civilized? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> I suppose they are. (laughs) Many of them. Those who live a long time near Lautoka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He says those who live in the cities, they are civilized. But others, they live in the villages, not very civilized. You have any other question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have questions? No. (pause) You have got desire to become a devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have a desire to become devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then where is your desire, fulfill it. What you are doing here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Actually, I've got three friends from work in Sydney, and we started traveling around the country, and we ended up in Perth with no money. So we are here from last four months trying to get a job and save some money and go back to Sydney.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So not getting job?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> Jobs are very scarce in Perth. We've been trying very hard, but so far, it's no go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here we have no arrangement. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No. Here there's no arrangement. In Sydney or Melbourne there would be some facility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New Delhi you were born? How long you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian boy:</span> I was just nine months old when we left Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Australia, they are inviting people to come here for working, but how is that? They do not get job?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They are not in control. There is a jobless rate, unemployment. They call it unemployment. It goes out of control. Sometimes people lose their jobs, and they can't find a job. But the government is not able to control the economy very well. All over the world this happens. So sometimes people try to get a job and they can't get the job.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is enough jobs if the government arranges to engage them in growing food. But there is no such arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No. There is so much land in Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government should have some arrangement for engaging... (end)</div>
