<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) You are so rich, you can do it, continually festival: "Come on. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Just like... What is that? You told me? Continual massage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Massage parlor, twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) Twenty-four hours. Similarly, twenty-four hours, free <span class="Italic">prasādam:</span> "Come on." But they are not hungry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not for that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...trunk as fat as this is, very long, where I saw it? Maybe... Mexico, I think. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...trees that are so fat that you can drive your car through it. They have made an opening...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And you can drive your car through it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Redwood tree. Those are the trees that are so old, sometimes five thousand years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Taravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti [SB 2.3.18]</span> <span class="Italic">. Bhāgavata</span> says that "You are trying to prolong your life. Don't you know that trees live more and more years than yourself?" <span class="Italic">Taravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti.</span> So what is the use of such living? A tree standing for five thousand years, what is the use of such living? Therefore, those who are trying to live for many years, they are being instructed, <span class="Italic">taravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti [SB 2.3.18]</span> <span class="Italic">.</span> They are also living being. And what is the use of living? First of all, that... For the same purpose, eating, sleeping, mating, and living for five thousand years, ten thousand years, what is the use? <span class="Italic">Taravaḥ kiṁ na jīvanti, bhastrāḥ kiṁ na śvasanty uta.</span> [break] This park is very nice. [break] <span class="Italic">... śunīcena.</span> We are all trampling. There is no protest. [break] Our man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (laughing) No, yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> He wants to be immortal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this keeps healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's good for the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śīrṣāsana,</span> it is called, "sitting on the head," <span class="Italic">Śīrṣāsana. Śīrṣāsana, padmāsana, yogāsana.</span> There are so many <span class="Italic">āsanas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't practice those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no time from sleeping. (laughter) Otherwise, this is not bad. This is not bad. It keeps good health, these <span class="Italic">yogāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> So if we have time we can do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Not required. (end)</div>
