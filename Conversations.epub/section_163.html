<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...my Guru Mahārāja was in his last days, these rascal doctors injected... Our, this Kuñjabihārī, Tīrtha Mahārāja brought so many big, big doctors. And he protested, "Why are you giving me injection?" He protested. He personally said, "Why are you giving me injection?" And if you bring a doctor, the rascals will not stop. "Oh, that is our treatment. We must try our best." They will plead like that. "To give more trouble to the patient, that is our business." Inventing new medicines means inventing new means of giving trouble. That's all. As soon as you ask them whether by injection the life is guaranteed, they will say, "No. There is no guarantee. Let us try, make experiment." Yes. In hospital, as soon as you get (microphone moving)... Whatever nonsense knowledge they have got, they make experiment, at the risk of other's life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> When Himāvatī broke her leg they wanted to operate. I said, "Oh, no, no chance. No operation." Then they immediately said, "Then maybe she'll never walk again."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> So I said, "Well, how can we tell?" They said, "Well, there's no way to tell." I said, "Suppose we operate. Then it's guaranteed that everything will be all right?" They said, "No." But they thought they should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They canvass, they convince like that and make experiment. That is their business. They have no, I mean to say, assured idea. Simply experiment. All these hospitals, they are meant for making experiment. I think I have told you one story of my servant. Did I? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No. Please tell us the story. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) The servant was crying, "Oh! I am dying, I am dying, I am dying." So I immediately called ambulance and took her to the hospital. Then, when I went there, there were so many neophyte doctors. They experimented, and they said, "Immediate operation is required." "Why?" They gave us some technical terms. Then their leader doctor came. He said, "All right. Let us see this night. Then, next morning, we shall operate." So I asked him, "I can go? He may remain in your charge?" "Yes." So I went, came back. And when I was absent, another servant of the neighbor, he told to my wife, that "Babuji..." Babuji means master. "...it is unnecessarily he has taken to hospital. He was drunk, and he was crying like that. (laughter) He drank." So my wife told that he was drunk, and he was therefore crying like that. "No, no. Doctor says that it is a serious case (laughter) and it is to be operated." And the next morning the servant came back. "And why you come back? You were to be operated?" "Oh, <span class="Italic">thik hai.</span> It is now all right." Just see. The rascals were going to operate. He was drunk. In drunken state he was crying, and they took it a case of operation. That is my practical experience. Everything you take there: "Operation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's a symptom of the modern civilization, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Operation. That is... Demons are to be cheated like that. Simply operation. Simply operation. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Also they're trying to get money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Injection and operation. That is in their hands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Should we try to avoid getting injections as much as possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my opinion. But as soon as you go to a medical man, especially in your country, first of all, you have to give blood, immediately. (laughter) One ounce of blood immediately. First business. And then other injection. Because I underwent so many medical examination, I have got experience. For my immigration. I think, three or four times I was under health examination, and blood-taking, and injection. Of course, it is not very painful. That arrangement is there. But the business is like that, "First of all give your blood; then talk of other things." Better to die without a doctor. (laughter) That's the best principle. Don't call any doctor. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and die peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But what about when you're not going to die... What about when you have some problems that's not fatal. Then who would we call?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then go take injection. What can be done? (laughter) There is no alternative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> How long will you be feeling bad from the injection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it remains simply for a while that is sufficient to kill you. There is no question of how long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's just that you don't look very... You don't look like your normal self. There's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes they do business, simply water they inject. Yes. Simply water and take fee. They know there is no necessity of medicine; still, they will inject some water, distilled water, and take the fees. I have seen the doctors and some, I mean to say, ordinary man, illiterate. "What kind of treatment you want? Injection or medicine?" So naturally, he will say, "The best one. I want to..." "Then you have to take injection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or both. You might get both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have seen, they have spoken like that. Because the patient will think, "Oh, I take injection, I'll be very quickly cured." He will canvass like that. Because if he gives a bottle of medicine, that will not be very costly. But injection in his hand, he'll (have) at least five rupees, that much. So he'll canvass like that, "What kind of treatment you want, injection or ordinary medicine." So he'll say, "Sir, best medicine I want." "Then you take injection." That's all. It is a fact that the whole human civilization is a society of cheaters and cheated. That's all. Any field. <span class="Italic">mayaiva vyavaharite. </span>The whole world in this Kali-yuga: <span class="Italic">mayaiva vyavaharite. Vyavaharite </span>means ordinary dealings, there will be cheating. Ordinarily, there will be cheating. Daily affairs. Not to speak of very great things. Ordinary dealings, there will be cheating. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, mayaiva vyavahari. </span>The sooner you get out of this scene is better. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So long you live, you simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and preach Kṛṣṇa's glories, and that's all. Otherwise, you should know that this is a dangerous place. <span class="Italic">Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ [SB </span>10.14.58]<span class="Italic">. </span>In every step there is danger.</div>
