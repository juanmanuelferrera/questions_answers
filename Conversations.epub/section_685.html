<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that I shall be happy in this material world, he'll not be able to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The slightest tinge of a material desire will force him to take another body. Is that it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa will give him full advantage of enjoying this material world. Unless he is disgusted, he cannot. He'll not become disgusted. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, "Give up this." Personally, he is not going to be disgusted. <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa personally asks him, "Give up this business." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> But we are thinking, "Eh! Why this man asking like this? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> I shall give up my business, I shall give up my family, I shall give up my country and simply surrender to Him? Oh, it is too much. Sophisticated." What is called? "Sophistry." What is sophistry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sophistry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Half wise, half foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sophistry means some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ... philosophy that is not sound. Superficial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is... That is the remark of Dr. Rādhākrishnan, when Kṛṣṇa said like that. That means "He... Too much," because he thinks, "Kṛṣṇa is..., may be a very big man, but He's a man. Why He is asking like that?" [break] ...first business is to give him always miseries so that he may be disgusted. But he is so foolish, he is not becoming disgusted. Everyone knows this is very troublesome world, but nobody is disgusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> He's like the horse who chases after the carrot. He never gets it, but still, he keeps trying for it. He never gives up. He keeps trying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many examples. <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā.</span> Only for this fault, <span class="Italic">gṛha-vratānām-</span>"I shall be happy in this material world." In Delhi, we established that center. You had been there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ananda...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ananda Niketan.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Full of foreign embassies. So nobody came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They came the first night, and that was it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Neither were they very friendly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They thought that "We are living so nicely, embassy and ambassador, and living in such a nice house, comfortably. What is this nonsense, God?" All these embassies and the ambassadors, they are prized post. It has no use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're what, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prized post only. Governors, the embassies, this is... These are invented to satisfy the agitators, politicians, because the opposite party will agitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So give them some house and some post.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Give them some. That's all. It has no use. They do not do anything. Simply hold that post and get nice house, nice salary, servants, honor, and sometimes they are called and make some speech. That's all. And whatever nonsense he may be, if he is governor, then everyone will respect him. That's all. And as soon as the same man is not governor, nobody goes to kick on his face. I have seen so many governors. When they retire, nobody... (aside:) Where is that cap? Nobody cares.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is this desire for material happiness the cause of material attachment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliya jīva bhoga vāñchā kare.</span> When they forget to serve Kṛṣṇa and wants to enjoy this material world... Don't you see that these Māyāvādī philosophers are trying for liberation, and still, they are expecting to become God. That is another desire. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> The high ambition, to become God or equal to God, that is going on, struggle for existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about these rascals like Sai Baba? They use Kṛṣṇa's philosophy, and then they twist it in such a way that it becomes Māyāvāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He's a cheater. People want to be cheated. They come to <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> for some material benefit. Don't you see that people are so much anxious to touch the feet of a <span class="Italic">sādhu?</span> What is the reason? Reason is that if he gets some favor of the <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> "Then I shall be happy materially." That's all. They have no idea, becoming servant of Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Āśīrvāda</span> (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Swami(?) Deji(?) once told me he once wanted your <span class="Italic">āśīrvāda.</span> I didn't know what the word meant. He was shocked. "You don't know what <span class="Italic">āśīrvāda</span> is?" It was like I did not know anything because I did not know that. It means to take the benefit from the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if he's a real guru, then the real benefit will be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> To be engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Do you want another cover, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is all right. [break] ...the male, that one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The red one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is also male. [break] ...for their family. <span class="Italic">Gṛha-vratānām.</span> Wife, children, they are also enjoying. <span class="Italic">Viṣayaḥ khalu...</span> This wife and children and material happiness he will get in any form of life. So if the human life is also the same thing, then where is the benefit? But they are proud that "The... They are loitering on the..., without any home. We have constructed this home. Therefore we are advanced." This is their philosophy. The business is the same. "That's all right. But we are improved." This is advancement. Business is the <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> the same sex, same eating, the same sleeping, same defending, but in an improved way. Even in the heavenly planet, wherever you go, the same thing, simply... Just like this country and Europe, the standard of living different, but the business is the same. And the... When they improve or so-call improve the standard of living, they think, "Now we are advanced." And what about your death? (aside:) Stop. The chicken is also dying; you are also dying. What is your improvement? That they cannot say. Real problem they cannot solve. Simply a little high standard of living, and they think this is advancement. And the Western civilization is influencing all other parts of the world in that way-"Improve the standard of living." There is no improvement, but it is <span class="Italic">māyā;</span> they are thinking, "This is improvement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Progress, yes. The progress is that they have got motorcar, and they have progressed how to die quickly. This is the progress. At any moment he can die. As soon as he on the car, 70 miles speed, that means taking the risk of dying at any moment. This is the progress. Formerly people were going in bullock cart or horse carriage from one village to another. "That was primitive. Now we can go hundred miles away from home for earning money and taking risk to die at any moment. That is progress." Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly they were satisfied by tilling the ground, getting food grains. Now they have started factories. At the cost of thousands of men's labor, some director is getting money and enjoying life. That is progress. And these rascals, laborers, they are thinking that "These men are getting the profit, cream of this business. We are working. Why not take ourself?" That is Communism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is one small coal mining town we did <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> at, an Indian community. And they were thinking that "The coal mine is doing everything for us. They're giving us schools, they're giving us medicine, they're giving us... Without the coal mine where would we be?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Here they think it's sugarcane. The sugarcane is everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Giving everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why can't people understand to depend on Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like air that we breathe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> no education. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means we are giving intelligence; therefore they are understanding. But there is no such propaganda. There was no such propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> One of those reporters yesterday was saying "Well, there's so many philosophies from India. Why have you started this one?" But actually no other philosophy has given this message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I said that "Why you are bringing India? The whole world is in darkness." (to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a verse in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Yenātmā suprasīdati:</span> "By rendering devotional service to the transcendental Lord, one becomes completely satisfied." So what happens? These people in material life, they come to the temples and they chant a little bit. But they find that the standard of pure devotional service is so high that they're not able to grasp it. They don't feel the complete satisfaction. They're still attached to the material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is compared with the jaundice disease. Jaundice disease, for jaundice, sugarcane is the medicine. But they taste sugarcane as bitter. Sugarcane... One who is suffering in jaundice will taste sugarcane as bitter. That is the test. So that is the medicine. So he has to take the sugarcane. And by taking, when he is cured he will find, "Oh, it is very sweet."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then he has to recognize there is some problem living in this material world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He does not find any happiness on account of his too much materialistic mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That is the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the disease. So it has to be cured by this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> So in the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> in the beginning, it will taste bitter. Therefore they do not come. But if they take to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> then the material disease will be cured and they will find it is very sweet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So the more people try to enjoy materially, they become more and more unhappy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are in the material world means everyone is diseased. [break] <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānāḥ, duṣkṛtinaḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is described. This is the material disease. I explained how they are committing sinful life: slaughterhouse, this liquor house and so many things, simply sinful. And they do not know they are going to suffer again in another body. He's going to be slaughtered next life. "Life for life." You are taking life, so many lives; you have to give so many times life. Take birth and become killed. Take birth and become killed." There is no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes people ask, Prabhupāda, that if one falls down into lower species of life like plants or animals, how then do they come again to the human form of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is nature's way. Give them again chance to develop. From trees they become flies. That is the beginning of movement. Then from flies to birds, birds to beast, and beast to animal, er, human being. This is great chastisement. You cannot move even. Suffer torrents of rain, cyclone, scorching heat, pinching cold. Stand up for hundreds and thousands of years. Then, when the punishment is finished, then he becomes moving. If there is scorching heat he can move to some shelter. But he cannot move. They do not study all this science, why there are so many varieties of life, of different grades. Wherefrom they are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The living entity, then, in the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The living entity inside the tree is actually conscious of its condition of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not advanced consciousness, but he is conscious. He feels. He feels.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It shocked a lot of people when they made the test of bringing a scissor to a plant, and they put some electrodes on it and they found that the plant was reacting with fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That machine has been discovered by Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose. He discovered this wireless telegram, radio. But Marconi took from him, and British government helped him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The British again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Britishers were advertising outside India that "Indians are uncivilized. Therefore we are making them civilized. Therefore we should stay there. Don't object." Because United Nations, they were asking, "Why you are occupying India?" So they used to forward this argument, that "These people are uncivilized. We are making them civilized." (laughter) Now, how there should be Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose? Therefore they used to suppress always. Everything Indian wanted to do, they would suppress: big businesses, this mining... They would suppress. This Morarji, Sumati Morarji, her father-in-law started that... He had to face so many impediments from the Britishers to start the shipping company. Formerly there was no shipping company, Indian. Now, before that, there was shipping, not shipping company, but navigation was there from India to Rome, Greece, Turkey, there was regular business of spices and fine cloth. Later on, this large-scale shipping industry, that was done by the Europeans. So when Indian wanted to start, they would supress. The Tata iron industry, he had to face so many difficulties. Formerly, even if you wanted to bring some iron frame, it would come from Sheffield.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> From where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sheffield.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, England.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> England. So everything Indian required, they would supply, and they would govern and they would exploit. Therefore they became so rich-simply by exploiting India. And Indian soldiers, they expanded empire-Africa, Burma. That's all, all Indian exploitation, Indian men, money, and exploitation. As soon as they lost India, they lost whole empire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Now they are also suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? That... That must be. They will be suffering more and more. They will be beggars. They have done so much sinful activities for expanding their empire. Now they will have to become beggars. And within two hundred years, everything finished. They started their exploitation from seventeenth, eighteenth century. And in the twentieth century, everything finished. The French people and the English people... This is also one of the examples. Both the nations came here to exploit. That was the competition in... The French people and the English people, they would go for colonization, fight, and establi... America was also that, Canada, everywhere. But because they were their own men, they were given dominion status. Almost free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Greedy. Very greedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> At one time all of Africa was controlled by the European nations. Completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mainly these French and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> French, British, Germans, Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In South Africa, the British also tried to take over South Africa. There was a war called the Boer War.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So during World War I and World War II many of the South Africans, they actually sided with the Germans because they were against the English so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> African means black Africans. No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. South Africans, they were Europeans. The British started the first concentration camp. They took these "Afrikaners" as they call them, Europeans. They put them on an island called St. Helena. That was actually the first concentration camp, by the British.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. Still, even the opposite party, they are not disgusted-"This material life is not very peaceful." They are not disgusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Now they are thinking, "We'll be independent..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That... They are trying to be independent. And India... Just like India has got independent, and now the position is "emergency." They do not think in this way, that "Independence or dependence, we are actually dependent under the laws of nature." That they do not think. They are thinking... The same example as I gave, that "This boil is here. Why not here? It is very painful," like that. They have no sense that so-called dependence or independence, he has to suffer. That he does not know. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha nābhijānāti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa explains, <span class="Italic">vāsudeva sarvam iti,</span> that He is everything and that He is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So this verse, <span class="Italic">mūḍho 'ya nābhijānāti,</span> that the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> they can't perceive Kṛṣṇa. So actually it's simply that we're covered, isn't it? But Kṛṣṇa is always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is always there, but <span class="Italic">yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ.</span> He does not know Kṛṣṇa on account of being covered by the curtain of <span class="Italic">yogamāyā. Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yogamāyā-samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> But we can make them all happy by Kṛṣṇa consciousness, if they follow our instruction, even in this material world. <span class="Italic">Pūrṇaṁ sukhāyate.</span> Full happiness we can give them if they follow our principle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They have so many doubts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the doubt? Doubt means they cannot drink, they cannot continue slaughterhouse, they cannot continue brothels. That's all. This is their doubt, that "How these things will be maintained? This is our life." That is doubt, and that is the difficulty. As soon as we say, "No this," oh, they are in danger. Even Marquis of Zetland, "Oh, it is impossible to give up. This is our life." There is the difficulty. Otherwise, there is no difficulty. They cannot think of, especially the Westerners, that without these things one can live. So many, our disciples, left. Rāyarāma left: "Oh, Swamiji is denying the preliminary necessities of life." This is the preliminary necessities of life: illicit sex, meat-eating, drinking, gambling. They cannot think that a man can live without these things. Therefore people are wonderful, that "How he is turning these Europeans, Americans to this standard?" That is their wonder. Nobody can think of, that these things can be given up and one can avoid it. It is dream. Your government, American government, is also surprised that "We have spent so much money for stopping this LSD, and this man by saying his disciples, they are giving up." Judah has also mentioned that. That is their surprise-"How these things can be given up? It is impossible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You once said in Geneva that no one has died by giving up smoking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually that is the fact. You have given up these four bad things, and what is your wrong, harm? Rather, you have become bright-faced. But they will not give it up. They think, "It is impossible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say we have just undergone some religious conversion and become fanatical, and therefore we have given up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why don't you become fanatical? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Although it says in the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> even that one should praise the Lord's name with cymbals and drums...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no concern with <span class="Italic">Bible</span> and God and everything. They are simply after sense gratification. What is the use of quoting about <span class="Italic">Bible?</span> They don't care for <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> The Europeans, Americans, they have rejected, thrown away, kicked out <span class="Italic">Bible</span> because (it is) unscientific. Actually they do not accept. Although they call themselves Christian, they do not accept anything of <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> That is... <span class="Italic">Bible</span> is finished. There is no meaning of <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> Simply for their sectarian prestige, they say <span class="Italic">"Bible."</span> But actually they have nothing to do with <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not go to the church, but they come to us for arguing with <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> Just see. What is the meaning? Their churches have closed, nobody goes, and they come to argue with us with <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> That means "The Devil cites scripture." They are devils, and they are quoting from <span class="Italic">Bible.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So many people who come to our program, they are Christians. There may be 75% who come. They are all Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We don't discriminate whether he is Christian. We take everyone as human being, welcome. So what do they say? They also quote <span class="Italic">Bible?</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who are you? Then I can say also, "You hear me. Forget about <span class="Italic">Bible.</span>" Anyone can say. Why the priest? Wherefrom the priest has come? Has he dropped from the sky? (laughter) That's it. Everyone can say, "My dear priest, you hear me. Don't talk of yourself. You hear me." Everyone can say. Then? How things will be adjusted? The priest is also a man; I am also man. If he can say like that, I can say like that. Then who will make adjustment? Who is correct? Hm? How it will be adjusted? If everyone will propose something, and who will say, "Now, out of so many proposals, this is correct." That means chaotic condition. If everyone says, "What I say, you hear." Then who will hear? Everyone will say only. Who will hear? That is going on actually. And rascal Vivekananda says, "Everyone's opinion is good."</div>

However nonsense it may be, it is all right. Even Gandhi followed that philosophy. Therefore he invented one, another philosophy, nonviolence, which is impossible. When Hindus approached him, that "You have got so much influence over the Mohammedans, so why not stop cow killing?" he said, "It is their religious principle. How can I interfere?" Just see.</div>

Whole world is full of nonsense, <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> beginning from Gandhi to any rascal, all of them, rascals. Perhaps it is the first time we are detecting, "Here are all rascals." It is first time. Then we are enemy of everyone. We call everyone rascal-Gandhi rascal, Vivekananda rascal, Aurobindo rascal. So actually they are, but people are thinking, "These people say all big, big men rascals? Therefore they are rascals."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> The average man doesn't have the intelligence to discriminate between an intelligent man and a fool. He will listen to anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got this from the standard test tube, Kṛṣṇa. Anyone who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha.</span> That's all. We have no difficulty. Just like that urine test? We have got...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...this is a fact, that our Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the topmost yoga, and preach it. This is a fact. Except we, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, nobody knows anything-all <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Any association, any religion-all <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> But you must prove yourself. Otherwise it will be bigotry. If you simply say that "We are only first class" without any knowledge... You have to defend yourself. There will be so many opposing elements. Then you become first class. Your position is first class, but you have to maintain it. Otherwise, they will say "religious fanatics." Any opposition party, you have to meet. That is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to sit for some time here, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] (Devotees have been teasing Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa in background regarding his suggestion) He said, "Don't bring milk when water is required." I was just asking, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Don't bring milk when water is required. You have given the example.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. No, I wasn't. I was thinking of Prabhupāda's satisfaction. You're thinking what I'm thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are right. He was right. That is service. Before wanting, that is... That is all right. "Now let the master refuse it." But service is: before he asks, the thing should be offered. That is service. After asking, offering something, that is second-class service. First-class service, before he wants, "Here is the thing, ready." That is first-class service. Now it is his liking. He may not like that. He may ask something else. But the service must be offered. And your example, milk and water, is not applicable here. I did not ask him either milk or water. (laughter) So your example is futile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So don't be discouraged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Prabhupāda. I'll never leave your lotus feet. They asked you about other movements yesterday at the press conference...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...this movement and that movement. You said, "This is Kṛṣṇa's movement." So this should be our line of argument, because especially amongst the Indian community, when they question us about this swami and that swami...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They replied that in everything there is light. And yes, the light of, what is called, glowworm and the light of sun is not the same. Everything is light; that doesn't... We haven't got to accept so-called lights. Even there is light, when there is sunlight, why you should aspire after glow of light? (People chanting in background) Who is chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Everyone is saying Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Rāma Hare Rāma. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So all those sinful activities of these people have been eradicted now by saying Hare Rāma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Immediately. That is the special advantage of this age. <span class="Italic">Kirtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> Immediately becomes free, <span class="Italic">mukta-saṅga.</span> Without becoming <span class="Italic">mukta-saṅga,</span> they cannot chant even. Why others are not chanting, they are chanting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But the same... That means they will make more sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he does, that is another thing. Otherwise, for the time being, he is freed from all the reaction of sinful, immediately. <span class="Italic">Sadyaḥ savanāya kalpate. Sadya,</span> immediately.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is pious activity on the material platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is transcendental, above pious activity. By accumulation of pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental position. <span class="Italic">Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 10.12.11]<span class="Italic">. Puṇya</span> means pious activities. After doing for many, many years simply pious activities one may be elevated to the transcendental platform. So pious activities cannot be compared with transcendental activities. But it may help in the long run. Therefore transcendental activities does not depend on pious activity. It is not dependent. Then it will take long, long years. But automatically he becomes pious, achieves the result of pious activities.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we ever had any kind of power like that and tried to do something like that, they would accuse that this is like the Crusades.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, Crusades, even... If they could expand the ideas of Christian, love of Godhead, that was nice. But that was not the purpose. It is exploitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even by force?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. By force if you give some good medicine, that is good for him. In my childhood I would not take medicine. Exactly like this, now also. (laughter) So I was given medicine by force in the spoon. Two men will catch me and my mother take me on the lap and then force and I shall take.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> That is going on. Just like mother Yaśodā. She would chastise Kṛṣṇa. But you will never find Nanda Mahārāja is ever chastising. Rather, when Kṛṣṇa was chastised, Nanda Mahārāja would come back and take Him on the lap: "All right, I shall punish Your mother," and call him (her?), chastise. And then Kṛṣṇa will stop His mouth: "No, no. Don't do this." It is natural that when the child is in the lower stage, minor stage, the mother takes more care. That is natural.
