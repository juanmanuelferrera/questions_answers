<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "If I don't fight, they will live."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is already planned. So even if you don't kill, it is there already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms for following verse:) "Translation: The Blessed Lord said: Time I am, destroyer of the worlds, and I have come to engage all people. With the exception of you, the Pāṇḍavas, all the soldiers here on both sides will be slain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I read further, sir, or you want to comment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The process is going on. Although we have got so many plans to save, nobody can be saved. The destination, the <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> that will go on.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Translation: Therefore get up and prepare to fight. After conquering your enemies, you will enjoy a flourishing kingdom. They are already put to death by My arrangement, and you, O Savyasācin, can be but an instrument in the fight."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is very important verse, that by <span class="Italic">kāla,</span> by time, due course of time, everything will be destroyed. So our duty is <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭha...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Fall in line with His wish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He wishes <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">, man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> This is our duty, not that "I have got that duty, that duty, that duty." That duty, that duty will not save you. They will be destroyed. <span class="Italic">Dehāpatya-kalatrādi.</span> This is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣu<br class="calibre2"/>ātma-sainyeṣv asatsv api<br class="calibre2"/>pramattaḥ tasya nidhanaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>paśyann api na paśyati<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 2.1.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">We are attached, <span class="Italic">deha,</span> this body. <span class="Italic">Apatya,</span> children. <span class="Italic">Dehāpatya-kalatrādi,</span> wife. <span class="Italic">Kala...</span> Because we increase through the wife, <span class="Italic">kalatrādi. Dehāpatya-kalatrādisu ātmā-sainyesu.</span> We are thinking that "They are my soldiers. They will save me from the clutches of death." <span class="Italic">Dehāpatya-kalatrādiṣv ātma..., asatsv api.</span> They are not permanent. So although they are not permanent, they will be killed, I am thinking, "They will save me, my soldiers." So <span class="Italic">pramatta,</span> this thought comes on account of becoming <span class="Italic">pramatta. Prakṛṣta-rūpena matta,</span> mad. Yes. <span class="Italic">Pramatta tasya nidhanam.</span> The plan is: everyone will be destroyed. <span class="Italic">Tasya nidhanaṁ paśyann api na paśyati.</span> Although he has got experience that "So many relatives, so many friends, so many family men, they have all died, they could not save me, and what these, my wife, children and others, will save me?" But because he is <span class="Italic">pramatta, paśyann api na paśyati,</span> even though he sees, he does not see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I go ahead, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Droṇaṁ ca bhīṣmaṁ ca jaya...</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...hesitating to kill Droṇa or Bhīṣma. They are teachers. But it is duty. Kṛṣṇa wanted. Because they were on the wrong side, they must be killed. That was Kṛṣṇa's desire. So he should execute. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "The Blessed Lord said: All the great warriors-Droṇa, Bhīṣma, Jayadratha, Karṇa-are already destroyed. Simply fight, and you will vanquish your enemies."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is our duty. Just like in this particular case, about our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, that so many people are giving me the credit. Actually, I have no credit. It is already desired or it is already planned that "This time in Western countries, this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement..." So it is our duty. Similarly, our only duty is to carry out the order of the Supreme. Other things is already done by Him. So if we abide by the orders of the Supreme, then we get the credit. We should know that. So our only thing is to abide by the... That is... Another place, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> is explained</div>
<div class="Verse">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir<br class="calibre2"/>ekeha kuru-nandana<br class="calibre2"/>bahu-śākhā hy anantāś ca<br class="calibre2"/>buddhayo 'vyavasāyinām<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>2.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So those who are <span class="Italic">vyavasāya, niścayātmika-buddhi,</span> their duty is to carry out the orders of the Supreme. And the Supreme is giving order in two ways: as <span class="Italic">caittya-guru</span> from within and as spiritual master. Inside and outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Consult your <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> within in action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore, to receive the order of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> one should approach the bona fide representative of Kṛṣṇa and take order from Him what to do, and that is his only duty. That is his only duty. Otherwise he will manufacture so many duties. That will not be helpful to him. That <span class="Italic">niscayatmika-buddhiḥ,</span> that has been very nicely explained by Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, that "Whatever order I receive from my guru, that is my life and soul. I don't mind whether I'll be liberated or not, whether I will be successful or not. That is not my concern. My only concern is to see whether I am factually, faithfully carrying out the order of my guru." This is... Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura notes. So these things are being explained in the same way that "You do not think which is right or wrong. You simply... I have asked you to fight. You go on fighting and take the credit. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I go ahead, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sañjaya uvāca...</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Sañjaya said to Dhṛtarāṣṭra: O King, after hearing these words from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Arjuna trembled, fearfully offered obeisances with folded hands and began, falteringly, to speak as follows."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So without seeing <span class="Italic">viśva-rūpa,</span> simply by abiding by the orders of Kṛṣṇa, if we act, then there is no question of trembling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So we must not try to see the <span class="Italic">viśva-rūpa,</span> to tremble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">[break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "O Hṛṣīkeśa, the world becomes joyful upon hearing Your name, and thus everyone becomes attached to You. Although the perfected beings offer You their respectful homage, the demons are afraid, and they flee here and there. All this is rightly done." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Siddha,</span> there is a Siddha-loka. So they can fly from one planet to another without any machine, <span class="Italic">siddha-saṅgāḥ.</span> Means the <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-siddhi yogas,</span> they have got naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-siddhis,</span> they have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They are called <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> Siddha-loka. Just like here if anyone wants to walk over the water, he requires to acquire so much mystic power. You see? Some of the yogis. But you will find one bird, skylark, one swan, he is very easily doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have <span class="Italic">siddhas</span> from the birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are trying to get that <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> the perfection, by so much yogic process, but another living entity, without understanding any yogic process, can do that. So these things are not very great gains. There are... In different planets there are different living entities. Just like we cannot touch fire, but in the sun globe there are also life, human beings, but their body is made of fire. Just like in the water. I cannot go into the water, but there are so many small fishes, they are living very nicely. So this we do not know. We are trying to gain success in these material activities, but by God's will, there are different living entities. They have already all the successes. So therefore our real business is not to waste our time to get any material success. Our real business is how we shall be successful to become an obedient servant of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. That is real success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I go ahead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Let me explain this. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered benediction, "Now you take benediction." So he said that "Where is benediction? I have seen my father was so powerful materially that even the demigods, they were frightened. So even if I get certain material successes, but you can finish it within a second. So why shall I take all these benedictions? Please engage me as the servant of your servant. That is my success."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Perpetual engagement in the service of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is <span class="Italic">vaiṣṇava-vicāra.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] It means they must. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms) "O great one, who stands above even Brahmā, You are the original master. Why should they not offer their homage up to You, O limitless one? O refuge of the universe, You are the invincible source, the cause of all causes, transcendental to this material manifestation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our duty is to accept the original Supreme, Kṛṣṇa, because...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...purāṇas,</span> not new manufactured. [break] If I have to offer my obeisances and surrender, why not to Kṛṣṇa? Why an imitation Kṛṣṇa? Why? Just like if you go to purchase some medicine, the shopkeeper may say, "Now, here is a medicine equal to this medicine, and its price is less." So no sane man will purchase. "Why I shall purchase the imitation for being less price? Give me the original." [break] ...the life of Ramakrishna. It is said that at the time of his death he said to his disciples, especially to Vivekananda, that "I am the same Rāma, I am the same Kṛṣṇa," and he took it. And he preached that "This Gadadhara Chatterjee, Ramakrishna." That's all. Then if he is referring to the original Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, so why not take the original Rāma and Kṛṣṇa? What is the proof? Simply by his words one can accept? Just like he is taking the proof, Arjuna. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "You are the original Personality, the Godhead. You are the only sanctuary of this manifested cosmic world. You know everything, and You are all that is knowable. You are above the material modes. O limitless form, this whole cosmic manifestation is pervaded by You."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, instead of accepting the original, real thing, why people accept imitation? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they get the earthly benefit much quicker by worshiping the lower gods. That is why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not lower gods. Lower god, I am not speaking. Imitation god. Lower god, demigod, they are lower. That is already... I mean to say somebody says that "I am the same Kṛṣṇa, same Rāma." Why he is accepted like that, giving up the original Rāma and Kṛṣṇa? What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Guru-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">guru-bhakti?</span> Guru never says that "I am Rāma-Kṛṣṇa, I am..." That is rascaldom. If any guru says that, then he is not guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is rascal guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a rascal, not guru. Rascal cannot be guru. You cannot add this. Then they are the same, <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> Nārāyaṇa cannot be <span class="Italic">daridra; daridra</span> cannot be Nārāyaṇa. Similarly, rascal cannot be guru, and guru is not rascal. So this is a question. I am inquiring from you. Why people accept this imitation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They want to be cheated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they don't want to be cheated, but... Of course, they are cheated. What is the psychology of accepting imitation false god? I am asking you. You, doctor sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this is going on. Why you should imitate?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are always right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You are not properly answering. (laughter) I know that. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You come into altercation unnecessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there must be <span class="Italic">paripraśna.</span> There must be <span class="Italic">paripraśna. Paripraśna</span> is required, but in submissiveness with reasoning, not like vagabonds, no. <span class="Italic">Paripraśna</span> must be there. Now, after reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> if somebody says that "Here is an imitation God accepted," is that very nice thing? This should be discussed. Otherwise, if we stick to our original principle and go on reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> three times a day, then what is the use? What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I go ahead? (Sanskrit) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It will be unanswerable by me. I have to submit. Otherwise you may fire me unnecessarily and create trouble, and I create trouble for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I will not fire. I'll not fire. We are coming to reasoning. Without <span class="Italic">paripraśna,</span> reasoning... Either you should accept that you should not, anyone, recommend any imitation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We accept God what is written in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> all right, in toto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, if we are actually student of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> we should accept it in total instead of deviating from that. That is my request. We are teaching that. Why one should deviate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Kṛṣṇa is one reality. He may have many forms. He may have many names. Kṛṣṇa is one reality. He is correct. But He can have many names. <span class="Italic">Eko sad-viprā bahudhā vadanti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bahudhā vadanti,</span> but <span class="Italic">bahudhā</span> are mentioned. Mentioned. Just like <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu-sahasra-nāma.</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Therefore, if you take one of the names, then you have to refer to the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> not that you manufacture one word. That you cannot do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> The <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> were also made by men, sages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, then which one you will accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> ...by the realized person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But you cannot say that in this age there are no realized persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It must corroborate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Corroborated by whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Corroborated by you. By you. If somebody says that "I am correct," then you have to refer to the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> whether he is correct or wrong. Just like a medical man. There is characteristic of certain chemicals. That is mentioned. So when accepting some chemical, the medical man tests in his laboratory whether it is correct. Not that somebody brings some chemical, some bunch of lime, and he says, "It is sodium chloride," or "Something, something." It must be tested. So the testing method is mentioned there, that the <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> means, "This <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> means his feature of body is this, his work is like this, he will come on such and such." Just like Kalki <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> Kalki <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra...</span> Although He will come after four lakhs of years, it is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that in Sambal... Sambal, in the house of Viṣṇu-josi, <span class="Italic">Kalki-avatāra</span> will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In central provinces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not central provinces. Not mentioned there. Sambal it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In northern part of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is also not mentioned. Simply Sambal. And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> was written five thousand years ago, and there is also mention of Lord Buddha's name. <span class="Italic">Kikaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati. Bhaviṣyati.</span> This word is used, "in future." So this is <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that even the incarnation will come four lakhs of years after or 2,500 years after, still, there is mention. His feature, his work-everything is there. Why should we accept a false imitation unless it is corroborated by the <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span> You cannot say everyone is realized soul because he recommends something. No. We have to corroborate. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is the defect of our understanding, that we accept everyone as realized soul. How he is realized soul? If he is speaking something wrong, how he is realized soul? Against the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is not realized soul. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ, na siddhim avāpnoti</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, then we shall accept. <span class="Italic">Sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya tinete karīyā aikya. Śāstra</span> will say, and guru will say, "Yes, it is rightly said." Saintly person also will accept. Just like Kṛṣṇa is accepted by Arjuna. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.</span> He immediately mentioned that "Such sage, authorities, accept. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says." Not that because Kṛṣṇa was His friend, he accepted blindly. No. That is corroboration. Whether it is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> whether other saintly persons... Just like there are so many <span class="Italic">avatāras,</span> but we have got our <span class="Italic">ācārya-sampradāya,</span> Rāmānuja, Yamunācārya. Whether they are accepting? Not a third class man accepted, and it is accepted. The <span class="Italic">ācārya. Ācāryavān puruṣo veda.</span> This is the way of accepting. [break] Everyone will create his authorities, and unlimited imitation of God will come into existence, and people will be diverted from the reality. [break] The same example, that "Here is an imitation medicine, very cheap, as good as the original one." Even taking it for acceptance that it is as good as the other one, but why in the presence of the original, I shall accept this imitation? What is your answer? Accepting this imitation is as good as the other, but if the other original is present, I can get it, why shall I go to the imitation? [break]</div>
