<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The following is Prabhupāda's final morning walk in Melbourne, Australia, in the Botanical Gardens on May 23rd, 1975.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...filled with fruits and flowers, then it would have invited many nice birds. But they do not know that. [break] ...chirping, the beauty of the gardens would have been more beautiful. But they cannot invite. There is no fruits, no flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sabhāpati:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, all the devotees on the walk this morning, they are the book distributors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sabhāpati:</span> They are the Australian book distributors, all the devotees on the walk this morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a fact that they do not grow fruit trees because people will eat and will not work? Is that the policy? Somebody told me like that, that if there is enough fruit, then people will eat and they will not work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The fruit business would go down also. The fruit stands would not be able to sell much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Bad policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The government does that. On some farmers they will pay them not to grow to keep the price high.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kill animals. Just see the policy. Instead of growing natural food, they will kill animal. Purposefully sinful life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But they still have to grow food for the animal. They're growing the food, but they give it to the animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fruit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> No, the food. They grow food for the animals, but then they kill the animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. They can grow food both for the animals and for human being. Instead, they are simply growing food for the animals and killing them. <span class="Italic">Tā'ra madhye jihwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati.</span> You sing this before taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> The tongue is the greatest enemy and greedy. <span class="Italic">Tā'ra madhye jihwā ati, lobhamoy sudurmati.</span> For the satisfaction of the tongue they are risking their own life and committing sinful life to suffer later on. Therefore the first-class man's first duty is to <span class="Italic">śamaḥ,</span> controlling the mind. If one can control the mind, that "If I can live with grains, food, and milk, why shall I kill the ani...?" this is controlling the mind. They cannot control even this small thing. "Live and let live,"-this policy they do not follow. "Live and kill others." "Live at the cost of others."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 1:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it says in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> that the weaker are the subsistence of the strong. So therefore human beings, they feel justified...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the... but where is the human consciousness? A tiger cannot understand this. He will kill a lower animal. But you are not animal; you are man. You should have this discrimination, that "If I can live otherwise very nicely, why shall I kill animal?" That is humanity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 1:</span> But also, is not eating vegetables killing a living entity also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not killing. If you take fruit, where is the killing? The tree is there. If you takes food grains, the food grains, after being produced, the tree dies automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yeah. Wheat is harvested after it dies, not while it is alive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in New Zealand we have a situation where the main industry is killing animals, the biggest industry, yet there is so much rain, so much nice atmosphere over there. Why is this? Why is there such a nice atmosphere but they are killing so many cows? Is that that they are innocent and they do not know and so Kṛṣṇa is not punishing them so much?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they will be punished. (pause) [break] ...so many motor accidents. And there will be war. Then wholesale punishment. Then killing, being killed within the womb of the mother. They are being punished. Nowadays these things have been introduced. Now this child which is being killed by the mother, they are all these sinful men. They cannot come out even, out of the womb of the mother. There they are killed. Nature's law is very strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 3:</span> In the western society, Śrīla Prabhupāda, people who are displaying a very bad sinful reaction in their birth are put away in institutions so they cannot be seen by the general mass of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He's saying people that are suffering very greatly in this life-they have so many mental disorders or physical disorders-they put them in institutions so that no one can see them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No one can see them. That means they are not suffering? (laughter) Just see how foolish persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this morning we have seen already a reaction is coming about against the killing of unborn children. There is one big poster that is being put up by a protest group which says, "The Queen Victoria Hospital kills unborn babies. Protest now," like this. So there is, I think, it's the Right to Life Movement in Victoria here that is fighting against this abortion activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are so sinful that they are unable to carry out. <span class="Italic">Upadeśo hi mūrkhāṇāṁ prakopāya na śāntaye.</span> If there is a serpent, if you advise him, "Please do not kill; be gentleman," will be become? Snake. Snake will kill, unnecessarily bite and kill. <span class="Italic">Sarpaḥ krūraḥ khalaḥ krūraḥ sarpāt krūrataraḥ khalaḥ:</span> "There are two envious living entities. One is the serpent and other is the envious man. So the envious man is more dangerous than the serpent." Why? Now, the serpent can be charmed by drugs and by <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> but this man cannot be charmed. So this advice will not act. They are so dangerous than the serpent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 3:</span> How, then, can we advise them, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they are like serpents? How can we...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can advise only, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will be all right," this one medicine. You can simply make plan how they will chant and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Then everything all right. This simple method. Bring them: "Please come here, chant, dance, and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>" They will be all good men. This process. Otherwise if you give them good advice, they will not be able to carry it. They are so sinful. Their treatment, the only treatment, is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Somehow or other, bring them together. Let them chant. Let them dance and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> They will be all right. <span class="Italic">Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā.</span> There is no other means to rectify them. We are opening centers different parts of the world just to give them chance, "Please come here, take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> chant, dance, enjoy," but that transcendental enjoyment will make them correct. We are the best friends of the human society.</div>
<div class="Verse">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam<br class="calibre2"/>kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva gatir anyathā<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Ādi 17.21]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Anyathā means otherwise there is no means to rectify these rascals. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There are so many altruistic movements, but actually there is no peace coming about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not effective. Just like the government spending to stop drug habit, millions of dollars, no use, but as soon as they come to us, immediately they give up. But still, the rascal will not pay the money to us. (laughter) We are doing so much benefit, but they will not pay. If you ask them money, "No, no, our money is not for religious purpose. For science. Our money is for science." Science means how, scientifically, you can kill cows. This is science. How, scientifically, you can become less than cats and dogs. This is their science. The cats and dogs also, they do not kill their children, but they are scientific advanced; the doctor advises, "Kill it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, most of the people in the western world are Christians and they say the cow has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not the question of Christian or western. This is the disease of the whole world. It is not that only the westerners are accused, not the others. No, it is... We don't say like that. Everyone... This is the influence of this Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> They feel justified in killing because they say the animal has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how fool they are. Therefore we simply say these are rascals. They have not even the common sense of an uneducated man. And they are scientist. Why there is no soul? What is the proof? What is their argument? Why they say there is no soul? What is the argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> Because it says in the Bible that until one accepts Jesus Christ one has no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus Christ said that animal has no soul? Has he said like that? Has he said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> He says that one must be born again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never he can say like that. He is not such a fool. He cannot say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 4:</span> Like this priest said the other day, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He said that the human being has a spirit soul, but the animal just has a soul. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) The same thing. "Everyone is sinful, but we are pure sinful." (laughter) Pure sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually most sinful activity appears to be promoted by the government for economic development. They have big state lotteries. They are planning to spend six million dollars developing a greyhound racing park here in Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. This is nice place to walk. Why on the ups and downs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> We have a bad tour guide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You were speaking before about controlling the tongue is very important. And in your lectures you have said simply by eating <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> this is controlling the tongue. But still, we have tendency when there is a big feast to eat very much <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Is this a good thing, or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) It is not very good, but it is still good. Instead of going to the restaurant and eat like the hogs and dogs, better take more <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> There is no harm. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa baṛo doyāmoy, koribāre jihwā jay.</span> Kṛṣṇa is so kind. Just to conquer over our tongue He has given us nice variety of <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Take it and control your tongue. Yes. Hmm. Don't come very near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 5:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you were telling this government man the other day not to kill the cows but to wait till they die. But they have a law that if the cow dies naturally, then it cannot be eaten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means we must commit sin. The government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I think their idea is that if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But their argument is fallacious. Kill means it dies. So how we can eat? Just see the... See their intelligence. Kill means it dies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They say that if it dies naturally it is due to some disease, so there may be some harm in eating such meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means nobody will die. Is there... The law is it to die. Why disease? Disease or no disease, everyone should die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But if we kill the cow without it, while it is healthy, then it is very good to eat the meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but the argument is die. As soon as you kill, it is died. As soon as you take the fish out of the water it dies. So how you can say that dead animal is not good? It is dead. For argument's sake, "A dead animal is not good," but you make him dead. Then you eat. Where is the argument that dead animal is bad? You are eating dead. That means they are not even common sense. That is the rascaldom. Rascal means one who has no common sense even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 5:</span> They would say then, "Why don't you let the vegetables die naturally before you eat the vegetables?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vegetable? We are not talking of vegetable; we are talking of animals. Why don't you kill your father? Old father, useless, kill him and eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually they are not very much concerned about their parents anymore either. They put them in institutions also when they get too old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, time will come; they will kill their father. Now they are killing their children. Now they will kill their father. As soon as the whole world will become Communist they will kill the old man, as the Africans, they do it. Africans kill their grandfather, and it is a festival. Yes. They throw the grandfather on the roof of the cottage, and it, rolling down, it falls down. Twice, thrice it dies. That becomes a great festival of the grandsons. They are eating grandfather. Glorious grandsons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> Then they eat the grandfather's brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And, you do not know, they like to eat white men. (laughter) Yes. They kidnap or capture, some way or other, one white man, and they eat it very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> They say that the grandfather is very learned so they eat his brain so they can get his knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they say like that? Oh, just see. He eats the experience. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> You were saying about how, in the car, that one eats the cow, they say, because it is <span class="Italic">sāttvika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> So the spiritual master, he is even more <span class="Italic">sāttvika</span> so he should be eaten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So eat the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, are these cannibalistic tribes, Amazons and whatever, are they classed as subhuman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are uncivilized. They are human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So do they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Human being comes to perfection when he is Kṛṣṇa conscious. So gradually they would have to come. Just like the bud of rose flower. When it is bud it is not so useful. When it fructifies, becomes a blossomed rose, then it is useful. Similarly, human being in other stages of life they are like buds. When they come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness then they are blossomed flower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if they're committing so many sinful activities, murdering their father and like this, then how will they get to that stage of being able to approach Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it will be checked. It will be checked. Just like if there is some worm in the bud, then the growing will be checked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Are the lower human species responsible for sinful activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. As soon as one is human being, he is responsible. Just like your state laws. Suppose a aborigine comes and does something criminal, will he be excused? Animal may be excused, but the man will not be excused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 7:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they mightn't excuse him, but they mightn't treat him as harshly as they would treat somebody in knowledge. Is this the same with the activities that these people perform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He said he wouldn't be treated as bad because an aborigine is not considered...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 7:</span> He hasn't got the knowledge. He's ignorant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still he is not excused by the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> He would be treated leniently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 7:</span> Would he be treated more leniently than someone that has knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know that. But ignorance is no excuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 8:</span> Or that example, Śrīla Prabhupāda. You said that the people in India are being punished more because they are in knowledge. They have the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> On an earlier walk you were saying there are three kinds of Vedic evidence. <span class="Italic">Śruti, itihāsa, and anumāna,</span> was it? I didn't understand what <span class="Italic">anumāna</span> was.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hypothesis. Hypothesis. Just like yesterday I was explaining that as soon as there is a machine, there is an operator. This is hypothesis. You cannot expect machine going on without operator. Similarly, this material nature is a machine and the operator is God. This is hypothesis. Even though you do not see God we can make this suggestion. That is human reasoning, logic. If any ordinary typewriter machine... This is a machine, but that requires operator. He is pushing this button; then it is working. It is not automatically working, any machine. So how this big machine is operating without any operator? What is this nonsense? They say, "There is no God. Nature, nature." What is the nature? Nature is a machine. Just like this body. This body is machine, and the operator is the soul, and the guide is the Supersoul. As soon as the soul goes away, then the machine does not work. This is common sense. But they have no common sense; therefore they are rascals, so-called scientists and others.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">They have no common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sabhāpati:</span> So who is the greater rascal, the material scientist or the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everyone. Everyone who... That is the statement. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> This class of men, they do not recognize God. Who? Those who are sinful, rascals, lowest of the mankind. Such people do not recognize God. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas.</span> (indistinct) educated. No, that education means false education. Real education is taken away by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Real education means to understand God. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one does not understand what is God, his education is useless. It has no meaning. What is that education? Will that education save him from death? Then what is the value of his education? Your real problem is birth, death, old age, and disease. Can this material education stop it? Is the scientist able to stop one's old age? And does anyone, man, any man, wants to become old? No, nobody wants. Everyone wants to keep himself youthful. But can the science stop this, that he will not become old? He must become old.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Then where is the education value? You cannot solve your problem, so what is the meaning of education? Education, knowledge, means you have solved your problems. They are trying to do that, temporary problem. But ultimate problem they cannot solve. Therefore the value of this education is useless. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 1.2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is simply laboring after something, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> They say that the value of their education is that very soon they will be able to overcome birth, death, disease, and old age, that they almost have the solution. They are freezing people's bodies...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore younger generation, they are not interested in education. They see that, after all, the life is vacant even after education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The leaders appear to have adopted a stopgap policy so that they can keep the people in ignorance and fool them that they are doing some good when actually they are not, so that they can maintain their position as leader. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> They are thinking by material adjustment they will be happy. That is not possible. But they are so fools, they do not think over it, that "Where is the solution? You have given me the chance to live in a skyscraper building, but is that solution of the problems?" They have no brain to ask this. Is it...? Does it mean that if you live in a skyscraper building there will be no death, no disease, no old age? Then where is the solution? But real problem is going on. Everyone is trying to save himself from disease, from old age, from death. Why do they go to the physician as soon as there is some disease? "That I may not die." The attempt is to save from the death, but ultimately they are dying. They have no brain to think of it. Why do they go to the physician as soon as one is diseased? Why do they go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They want to be well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then "well" means they want to save themself from death. That means they want not to die. But death is there. Then where is the solution of problem? But they have no brain to think that "What these rascals will do? My problem is there. It is not solved." And still they accept. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are eulogized, they are praised, glorified, by another animal. He is an animal, big animal, and a small animal says, "Oh, you are our leader." The big animal is praised by the small animal. Both of them are animals. None of them are human being. So this is going on. A big animal bluffs him that "I have done so much for you. You give me vote." That's all. And the small animal thinks, "Yes, he has done so much. Give him vote." This is going on. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhaiḥ.</span> Everything is discussed in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that one blind man is leading other blind men. What is the use?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Hm? If I am blind man, if I say, "Come behind me. I shall take to St. Kilda," and as soon as I go in the road, you are killed, I am killed, that's all. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> They say at death, there is death then finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you will be finished, then why you are attempting so much? Sit down now. Why you are making advancement of civilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> For their children, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you advance in civilization or do not advance in civilization, you will die. That is sure. Then why do you labor so much? Huh? The animals, they do not labor so much. They live peacefully on the condition of the nature. Why do you labor so much? If the result is the same-the animal will die and you will die-then why you are laboring so much for nothing? That means they have no common sense even. Therefore they are rascals. That is discussed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna, "If you think there was no life before this body and if you think that there will be no life after this body, then why you are anxious for the body of your brothers and sisters?" So all these philosophies have been discussed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> After all, the conclusion is that they are all rascals. That's all. We have to take them as such rascals. After death everything is finished-that a child knows-but why you are making so permanent building? Piling, (imitates pile driver sound) "Donkhs!</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Donkhs!" very strong building. You are not strong enough to live there, so why you are making strong building? The building will stay, and you will die. So what is the use of making a strong building? Let the building also go with you. Why do you labor so much? Is it not? You are making strong building but you are not strong enough to live there. And why you are laboring so much? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Their excuse is that they are leaving something for the next generation, for their children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they will also not live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 1:</span> They think they will be recognized by their good works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means asses. The asses think that "I will be recognized by my work." He takes so much labor, load, although nothing, not a grain of the load belongs to him. But he takes the load unnecessarily. So this is their business. He will not live, his son will not live, his grandson will not live, but he is making permanent business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But when we're living we can enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that enjoy. <span class="Italic">Pramattaḥ.</span> They are called madmen. <span class="Italic">Pramattaḥ paśyann api na paśyati.</span> They know it certainly, "Every one of us will die," but seeing also, they do not see. And that is madman. <span class="Italic">Pramattaḥ paśyann api na paśyati.</span> That the animal, he is seeing that "One animal is being killed. Next time is mine," but still eating grass. He has no anxiety. This is called <span class="Italic">pramattaḥ paśyann api na paśyati.</span> This is animal life, that even though fact is there, they will close their eyes. That's all. This is animal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 1:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, even if there is a life after death, I don't know what it's going to be like, so why should I worry about it now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you are a man, you should be worried. Because you are not human being, next life you are going to be cat, you should be worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 1:</span> But the cats and the dogs, they are also happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if you want to become cats and dogs and happy, you be. Don't worry. That's all. But we are worried: "Why shall I become cat and dog? We shall go back to home, live with Kṛṣṇa." That is our ambition. Your ambition is to become cat and dog. You become.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> They are happy with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. You become happy. But we are not happy. What is the idea here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They want it to grow straight up. It looks like it started to go sideways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...human being who knows things that I explained this thing that by nature's process I have come to this human body. Now what is next progress? That is human being. And even still I remain cats and dog but they have no inquiry, then what is the use of getting this human body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 4:</span> Why, then, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is a person given a human body then, if they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that means better conscience. He can consider so many things. "Why I am dying? I do not want to die. Why there are so many miserable condition?" We are covering because there is miserable condition of this winter. I don't want to suffer from cold. Therefore I am covered. So this is struggle for existence. The human being can understand that why there is struggle? Why not I am happy naturally? This question must be there. Otherwise he is cat and dog. The dogs do not inquire all these things. Then if you have no such power to inquire and understand, then you are no better than dog. And if you are happy to remain cats and dogs, that is your business. But a real human being, he will never be happy. That is human being. Everyone is trying to improve his material condition. Therefore the motor car is going here and there, here and there. Why they are trying? Let them remain satisfied in any condition. The modern economic law is that create new necessities of life.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">That is the way of western civilization. They are creating motor cars every year, and the bank is prepared to give you loan so that you may work day and night. Take loan from the bank and purchase a motor car and repay him by working so their machine will go on. This is the policy, economic policy. Is it not? Yes. Keep them working, busy. But what is the purpose of this working? Now, when death is there, everything is finished. And everything will be finished, for that working? Just see their knowledge. Everything will be finished and for this purpose I have to work so hard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 6:</span> They think that you might as well enjoy while you can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if working hard like ass is enjoyment, let them enjoy. Let these rascals enjoy like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> Why do so many humans, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they do not use their propensity to ask the questions? They simply live like animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are animal. They are educated like animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> So it is the fault of the education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is the responsibility of the government, guardians, father. They do not give them proper education. Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, "If you cannot give proper education to your children, then don't marry. Don't become father." That is contraceptive. If you are unable to give... What is that? <span class="Italic">Pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt, na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum. Samupeta-mṛtyum:</span> this body means you have accepted death. This body means, material body. So one should not become a father if he cannot stop the death of his son. That is the Vedic injunction. "Don't become a father, don't become a mother, if you cannot train your children so that he may be saved from this impending death." That is the instruction. And who is doing that? Their philosophy is: "After death everything is finished. I will be finished. My child will be finished. That's all." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Australian devotee 2:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, they can teach these people how to educate the youngsters. Is this right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore so many books. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...the verse that you have put in the front of the first volume of the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kṛṣṇe sva-dhāmopagate,</span> that the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> can give light even to people in ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Kalau naṣṭa-dṛśām. Naṣṭa-dṛśām:</span> "They have lost their sight, what is the progress of life. They have lost their sight." (devotees offer obeisances as Prabhupāda enters car) (end)</div>
