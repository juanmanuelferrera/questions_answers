<div class="Conv-code"><span class="code">751006mw.dur</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> English, economics, philosophy or..., mostly Scottish... I was educated in Scottish Churches College. The philosophy professor, Dr. W. S. Urquhart, he was very friendly to me, very kind, just like father. [break] ...he became vice chancellor. He was a very learned man, and very nice man, W. S. Urquhart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did they teach in English or Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. English. Medium English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He was the one who said that the woman's brain is thirty-six ounces?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. (chuckles) Yes. No, not only he, another professor, Dr. Stephen (indistinct), he also said. That's a fact. Artificially they are trying. It has no meaning. But by agitation you can do anything. That is another thing. But that is not the fact. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are all Indian quarters? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This area? No, I think this is more European. But where we're staying is Indian area. It's all Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These European professors, they had to learn Bengali. They knew Bengali. It was compulsory. All European officers who used to come to India for responsible post, it was obligated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did they come mostly for missionary work? Was that their purpose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our professors, they came from missionary, but there were other officers in government service, I.C.S., Indian Civil Service. They were also. In the province where they were employed he must learn the provincial language. Their administration was excellent, undoubtedly, British administration. Nobody in the world, so far administration... But their crooked policy ruined them; otherwise good administrator, good politician, good diplomat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They made those nice buildings in Delhi, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes, and everything good. Simply heart was not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Only for Englishmen," "Only for Englishmen." Still that policy is going on here. That is not good. When one takes shelter of you, you must give him proper protection. That liberality is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They would make the people dependent upon them and then exploit them, yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the fault. Exploitation was their policy. Whole European, the France, Holland-go some other country and exploit. They were doing the same thing in America also. Therefore America rebelled. Washington was Englishman. Still, he rebelled. He separated. Independent. A small country and bring money from the whole world-this is their bad policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's actually amazing how they colonized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was actually amazing to think how they colonized almost...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were obliged to do that. In the country there is no food, no shelter, nothing. Therefore Hitler's determination was, "I shall make this shopkeeper nation again fishers." What is called? Fishermen. "I shall ruin their empire." So he did it. But he also became ruined. He did it. He ruined the Englishmen, but he also became ruined, finished, Germany finished. But Germany will be able to rise again. Englishmen will not be able to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why is that, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They committed so many sinful activities, yes, for maintaining their empire. To sell their Manchester-made cloth they ruined the cloth industry of India and cut this finger.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cut the thumb off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Thumbs of the weavers so that they cannot manufacture anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They cut the thumbs of the weavers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They were making finer cloth by hand than the British were making by machines. So in order to discourage, they would cut off the thumb so they couldn't weave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things. And to make a show, the Lord Hasting was impeached in the Parliament. Here the black men, they are Africans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. In this country there's nineteen million Africans and about over five million Europeans, about one million Indian people, and about one million colored people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So these women, what they are carrying on the head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know. What do they carry, Gokulendra prabhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gokulendra:</span> They carry all sorts of things, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Sometimes they carry their supplies that they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are local women or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. But they don't allow the Africans to live in the cities. They have to travel long distances, unless they are servants at some house. For the Africans to live in the cities, they have passes. They have to have a pass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Black men. The Indians, they cannot? They can?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Indians don't need pass. The Indians, however, they were only allowed to live where they were born. They aren't allowed to move around. But this year they finished that law. Now the Indians can live anywhere in South Africa in Indian areas. They can move around to different cities. Before this year they weren't allowed to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So post... [break] ...service is not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it is fairly good. But the Africans, they are so many they have to queue up. I don't think, in America, that the American negroes would be able to queue up and wait as patiently as these people. I think they have a little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have been trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> British influence. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...appears it is very clean city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This area is downtown, it's not so clean. Downtown is not so clean. This area is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is residential or industrial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Over here is all residential, European apartment houses. And along the beach there is all hotels. This is a very big resort area in South Africa. There's a... Whole south coast, going down for about eighty miles, is all resorts. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...English-made city?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Durban is English city. Capetown has Dutch influence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It resembles Melbourne. Melbourne. Australian Melbourne, this quarter resembles. [break] ...from Indian Ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Indian Ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Africa, one side Atlantic, one side Indian. [break] ...is growing on the sand, and they say there is no life in the sand. (break-windy beach) ...<span class="Italic">Bhoga. Bhoga</span> means sense gratification, and <span class="Italic">aiśvarya,</span> opulence. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām:</span> [Bg. 2.44] "Those who are lost of consciousness, such persons become attached to sense gratification and material opulence," <span class="Italic">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām,</span> "and not interested in Kṛṣṇa consciousness." <span class="Italic">Vyavasāyātmikā-buddhiḥ:</span> "How to become spiritually liberated, they do not care for it." These things do not interest them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're finding that most of our devotees, though, are coming from America. America is the most opulent place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not most coming. Some coming. The American population is very great. If most would have come, then things would have been different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of the fortunate persons like you, you are coming. <span class="Italic">Kona, kona,</span> "some fortunate." <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān jīva.</span> But you can convert them to become fortunate. Devotee can do that. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām.</span> They are thinking very much advanced, but they are lost of their sense, lost of their intelligence. They think of us as foolish. We do not enjoy life. (laughter) And we think of them as animals. This is the position. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānām.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Those who are spiritually fixed up, their determination is one, and those who are not fixed up, their mind is diverted in so many things, unnecessary things." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...<span class="Italic">vādīs</span> have given the philosophy that "Yes, <span class="Italic">vyavasāyātmikā-buddhir ekeha,</span> make the intelligence one, but you can think of anything. You can think of a rock, you can think of the sky."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You rascal. Anything... Anything one. So if I think of hell, will that do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, the Māyāvādī says, "Anything is as good as anything else."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How rascal they are. Anything else... This is Ramakrishna Mission's. They are rascals. These rascals, they do not know anything, and still, they have made a missionary activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have read one Māyāvādī. He says that it's as good to meditate on your wife as it is to meditate on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I read that, really. So degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>? Think of your wife at home. Why do you take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span>? Just see how rascal they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have gone against all the Vedic principles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Remain at home; think of your wife. Everyone is doing that. Then why do you take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and cheat others? <span class="Italic">Māyāvādam asac-chāstram. Asat,</span> it is very abominable philosophy. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gokulendra:</span> Yes. The police stopped us after about half an hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They went into the European area yesterday for chanting, Saturday morning. Usually we do the Indian area in Durban. But in Johannesburg we only do the European area <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> We have no trouble there. They say that Durban, being very much... Did the truck go? Yes? Why doesn't Prabhupāda go back in the truck?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's stuck in the sand. We'll have to push to make the wheels straight.</div>

He does not take care that "I am being forced to become something against my will, and I am freely doing all this nonsense." Just like the dog. Dog is thinking, "I am free," running here and there. As soon as the master, "Come on." (laughter) Just see. Even dog has no sense that "I was jumping like free, but I am not free." That sense he hasn't got. So if a human being has not so such sense, what is the difference between him and the dog? Hm? This is to be considered. But they have no sense, no brain, no education, and they are still going on as civilized.
