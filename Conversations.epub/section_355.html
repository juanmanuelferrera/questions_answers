<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...spoil this tree. Everything, their business is spoiling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> The day before yesterday we were driving down the road and we came across all of these coconut trees, and they were trimming them, and all the coconuts were up on the trees, but they were cutting them down, just letting them fall to the ground. And the the coconuts were cracking and just being wasted completely. And then they'd throw them in the garbage. And there's so much energy that Kṛṣṇa has provided here that they're just wasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As they are wasting, they will be punished. Kṛṣṇa's supply is being wasted. That will be punished [break] ...those coconuts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Coconut, you collect, and each one of you use at least two coconuts daily, drinking water and the pulp. It is very digestive and nutritious. The pulp is very nutritious and digestive. If you simply take the pulp from two sides and drink that water, you don't require to eat anything. It is so nutritious. So better collect, and so long you can get them, use two coconuts daily yourself. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...purchase that Kṛṣṇa, and when he'll ask this man to "Give me that Kṛṣṇa book, let me read," this "Kṛṣṇa" will give him some benefit, his calling <span class="Italic">"Kṛṣṇa Book.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-caitanya:</span> Just by saying <span class="Italic">"Kṛṣṇa Book,</span>" he makes spiritual advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...say, "Give me <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book.</span>" They say like that? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Last night a boy came up and asked, "How much are those books?" and he wanted to purchase one. It was very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda, one time we went to a shopping center and I was walking down the sidewalk and a boy came running up to me and he said, "Is that Volume Two?" And he said, "Can I have Volume Two?" He said, "I've almost finished Volume One, and I was in so much anxiety that I was going to not have anything else to read, because they're so beautiful." And he said that he works in a candy store, and he has so much anxiety all day from all the people that just give him problems and he doesn't like the work and he doesn't like the people. But he says that lunch time he goes and every day he reads the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> and he says he comes back feeling so high. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Praghoṣa:</span> ...so he came up and he asked me to look into, if I could show him the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> for a second. And he had two friends with him and he said, "Here I would like to show you boys something," and he said, "Do you mind?" And I said, "No." So I handed him the Volume One and he opened it up to that picture of Kṛṣṇa with Śrīmatī Rādhārāṇī playing His flute, and he showed the boy and he said, "Look, isn't He beautiful?" Just like that, and they both looked at Kṛṣṇa and said, "Wow," just like that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the very picture is attractive, Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> ...Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, very, very effective. Just like the man is feeling benefited that "I become tired and I read this book, very nice." So he'll gradually become devotee. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...this is on chanting <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span> in the streets, chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa in the streets with <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas</span> and <span class="Italic">karatālas.</span> It's a very important part of our program. Is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them are <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> When you chant, that is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana;</span> when you distribute book, that is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> When you read book, that is also <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> [break] ...joking, if one meets one fat man, so the other man will ask him, "Will you kindly let me know wherefrom you purchase rice?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They consume much rice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> In India. Is much rice consumed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... In Bengal. In Bengal the staple food is rice. Like Japanese.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> General people, they eat rice and fish, especially Bangladesh. They have got enough quantity of fishes. So they use rice and fish. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma, harer nāma, harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. (end)</div>
