<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is real scientist. Those who change every year theory, I don't like that scientist. Do you like that scientist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who? Nobody, no gentleman likes that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's not a scientist, who changes himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You cannot change your position. That is science. Kṛṣṇa has said that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So nobody has become greater than Kṛṣṇa up till now. That is science. Can anyone challenge Kṛṣṇa? No. And He has said, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that is scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but the scientists try to unearth the secrets of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Scientists, the modern science, is trying to unearth the secrets of Kṛṣṇa only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trying to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Unearth the secret of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā,</span> we are trying to unearth the secret of Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Those two scientists must come forward, eh? Now he is going to throw a bombshell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The difference of each comes in practically two, three <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> the one which you have also commented. There is. That happens, the <span class="Italic">Muṇḍakopaniṣad,</span> the beginning. (Sanskrit) So we are the scientists of the <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā;</span> you are the scientist of the <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span> So we must not have any quarrel. We have divided our sphere of activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no quarrel, but we say that these are for the rascals. Yes. <span class="Italic">Aparā-vidyā</span> is for the rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, even the greatest of the saints, namely, the guru of.... I mean, Śuka(?) Mahārāja, also he had the first <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span> Then <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.... Aparā-vidyā</span> is the first step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so long you are in <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā,</span> you remain a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but we always have to put up our step on the <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span> Then you put up your step on the <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span> You can't jump over it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. No. There is no question of jumping, but things should be realized as it is. <span class="Italic">Aparā...</span> This is <span class="Italic">aparā.</span> This is <span class="Italic">parā.</span> So this is inferior; this is superior. That you have to admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This was the question of Nārada Muni himself in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. And it is explained about <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā, antavat tu phalaṁ teṣāṁ tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām [Bg. </span>7.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore rascal, <span class="Italic">alpa-medhasa. Alpa</span> means no brain, no brain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have got those questions of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> other than of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Alpa, alpa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.... Parā-vidyā</span> means Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Parā-vidyā</span> means Kṛṣṇa. So one who.... Unless one comes to the point of Kṛṣṇa, he is in the <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span> And <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā</span> is meant for the less intelligent class of men. <span class="Italic">Tad bhavaty alpa-medhasām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then the whole question was, sir, here in <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> is <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But when, when Muni went...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> is the beginning of <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, sir. He said that "What you have learned? Let me know what you have learned. Then I will teach you further on."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And they said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To know what is your position, whether still you are foolish or you have become intelligent. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If he had not become intelligent, he would not have gone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That has to be.... Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That means he had become intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right. That is all right. He has gone to the.... That is pious. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtinaḥ.</span> Anyone who goes to Kṛṣṇa or <span class="Italic">guru</span> for asking, he is pious. He is not miscreant. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina.</span> He is not <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> He is pious. Maybe he is in the lower position, but he is pious. That is described. And one who does not go either to Kṛṣṇa or His representative, he is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, narādhama.</span> This is the difference. One man is suffering from some disease. If he has gone to the physician, he is intelligent. And one who says, "Ha, what is this? I don't care for that," he's a rascal. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He must come to me. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyone who accepts that "I must be treated," he is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir, but <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā</span> is meant for the body, <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā,</span> I mean to say. <span class="Italic">Parā-vidyā</span> is meant for the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So soul and body has got to live together. So there is a necessity of <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā</span> also to keep your body going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Parā-vidyā</span> does not mean to reject the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, there is a necessity of <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. No. That is to make the best use of a bad bargain, how to use the body best to perfect <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span> That is intelligence. Just like you have a car. A car is not neglected. We don't kick out car. But it must be used for spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I say, sir, that you must have the knowledge of car, and that knowledge of car is <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. No. There is no need of. You have the car, you can go from this place to that place very quickly, so utilize it for Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They must know how to drive it. That is knowledge. Why do you say no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That automatically comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How can automatically? Nothing can come automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll see many drivers. They do not know about mechanics, but very first class driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, learning driving is a knowledge of driving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, driving, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Svarūpa(?), why don't you say something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Many.... Many first-class owner.... You know. You are a physician. You are not a motor mechanics, but you know how to drive. That is not very difficult thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Isn't it when you drive for Kṛṣṇa, doesn't it become <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā</span> then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> When you drive for Kṛṣṇa, doesn't it becomes <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything is done for Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Anything spoken for Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">parā-vāṇī,</span> and this is <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudeva-parā...</span> There is a verse, <span class="Italic">vāsudeva-parāḥ karma vāsudeva-parā...</span> Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudeva-parā makhāḥ vāsudeva-parā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. So everything should be for Vāsudeva. And he is first-class wise man who knows <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā... [Bg. </span>7.19].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sudurlabhaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But such kind of intelligent person is very rare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> sir, you get actually when you become the real Vaiṣṇava, because then you see the presence of God in every inanimate and animate object.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is real Vaiṣṇava. Otherwise you are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. Without Vāsudeva, without Kṛṣṇa's order.... <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10].</span> Everything is being done under His superintendence. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa.</span> Even in the <span class="Italic">prakṛti, aparā</span> and <span class="Italic">parā...</span> There are two <span class="Italic">prakṛtis.</span> So even in <span class="Italic">aparā-prakṛti</span> there is superintendence of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am interrupting you, sir. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa sūyate prakṛtiḥ sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now then, <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa,</span> we want to learn how He <span class="Italic">adhyakṣa,</span> and that is our <span class="Italic">vidyā,</span> and that is our <span class="Italic">aparā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is real scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā.</span> And don't now, please, say we are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, then don't refer to <span class="Italic">parā-vidyā</span> (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are trying to learn it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but you defy Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Do you defy by trying to learn His <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa sūyate prakṛtiḥ sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10]</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now scientists say that "Now we are advanced. We don't require God." There is a book. Yes. "We don't require God. Now we shall adjust. We shall create.... We shall create human being according to our necessity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You are also scientist. You are on one side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that "We shall create human being according to our necessity."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is not possible to.... Can they create a leaf? Then let them create a human.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that.... Therefore we say rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then you don't take it, all of us, together. We are four or five of us here. We are next to you. We are none of those.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the same theory that "This side of stool is dry. It is good." (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because it going to be manure, manure the food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "And the other side is moist; therefore it is bad."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, sir. That type of stool which goes and manures the crop, that is good, evidently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, after all, stool, this side or that side.... The whole conclusion is that unless one is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he remains in darkness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the point. Therefore we are trying to enlighten people to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And a scientist trying to unearth the secret of nature means Kṛṣṇa. He is doing work for Kṛṣṇa, and he cannot be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, everyone has to work for Kṛṣṇa. Just like a prisoner in the prison house. He is also working for government, but he is forced to do it. Then nobody can escape Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Right, sir. But the scientist is not forced to do it. He freely does it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone. Why scientist? Even cats and dogs, they are also doing for Kṛṣṇa. You cannot.... Nobody can say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But scientist willingly does it to unearth the secret. Don't call him a rascal. The scientist does it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't say. Kṛṣṇa says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Kṛṣṇa says those people are rascal who does not believe in Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anyway, that is the test. If you don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, you are rascal. That's all. We are simple child, and Kṛṣṇa has said that anyone who does not surrendered, he's a rascal. So we say, "Are you surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?" "No." "You are a rascal." (laughter) No. Our test is very simple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And what do you mean by surrendering, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not know anything but Kṛṣṇa. He knows everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Surrendering means by mental process if I do through my mind. This is my definition. My mental process in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everything happening is.... By Kṛṣṇa's grace he's surrendering to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not mental. No mental concoction. Factual. Factual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is factual. That everything is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, mental concoction is not factual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, but I am.... You don't let me speak. I say that everything which is happening, a phenomena, is nothing but by the grace of God or by Kṛṣṇa's own order, and if that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you have no responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that mental process, if you are working, is it a wrong mental process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here is a greatest wrong. No, no. If your patient comes, that "It is by Kṛṣṇa's wish I have become diseased," then where is your department? You don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But by Kṛṣṇa's grace I have become a doctor. Both the ways. Why see on one side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then say that. Why do you say one side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Of course, everything is by Kṛṣṇa. The man is diseased by Kṛṣṇa, I am produced by Kṛṣṇa, I'll care by Kṛṣṇa this, that man, and that man dies, he will die by Kṛṣṇa's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then that is Kṛṣṇa's grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what I have been saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right. That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think I am not wrong. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when in everything you see Kṛṣṇa, that is the highest stage. That is the highest stage.</div>
<div class="Verse">sthāvara-jaṅgama dekhe, nā dekhe tāra mūrti<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra haya nija iṣṭa-deva-sphūrti<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. <i class="calibre3">Madhya</i> 8.274]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">When one sees, he sees this beach, but he does not see beach, he sees Kṛṣṇa. That is the highest stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was meaning that, but unfortunately my expression was very poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that may be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am not student of literature like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing can exist.... <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.</span> So everything is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam.</span> Where is not Kṛṣṇa? But the Māyāvādī says, "Everything is Kṛṣṇa; therefore let me worship the sand." That is rascaldom. "What is the use of going to the temple? Let me worship the sand." That is rascaldom. Kṛṣṇa says clearly, therefore,</div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ</span> means no more important.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I look a fool and they'll become wise, all of them, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You are wise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They want that I should say something, and then you call me a rascal, and they take pleasure in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkhī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, no. I say all right...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Vaiṣṇava is not happy in someone else's misery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...possible if you remain with the devotees.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Is <span class="Italic">satāṁ saṅga</span>? It is <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even good literature <span class="Italic">saṅga</span> is also <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So I am.... In the morning I do your <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> and afterwards I do the <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span> of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So it is a continuous <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> So don't say I am not doing it. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you are not.... I don't say that you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, about <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather, I think myself rascal because.... (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I say about <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga.</span> Let us turn the issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I could not draw you in my temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have drawn me lot, but still, you are dragging me by leg nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Into our hospital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think I am not fit to be with you, so far I consider myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I must correct myself and all my defects. Otherwise I would pollute you. [break] (laughter) I will become after sixty-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are fifteen years late already. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I must follow you. How much late you were? I will come after you. [break] ...you think sir, that is more important than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You must have the clothing in the internal side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, clothing is.... <span class="Italic">Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ ...sa sannyāsī</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is not the clothing.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they are <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It means they have no knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> has taken away their vision, their sense of understanding, sense of.... What do you call, sense of understanding or sense of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sense of reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Reality. I was trying to say that word, reality. <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> But today the whole world is practically <span class="Italic">asura.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...is a word declared to the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> You see? Therefore everyone is our enemy. Nobody likes us, because a declaration of war against the <span class="Italic">asura...</span> And we are fighting with some tiny soldiers, that's all. And they are very strong. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Thank you. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...we don't want who says that "Why you are searching after God? The gods are loitering in the street." Of course, it is in higher sense, but you cannot say respectively(?), "Everyone is God." Maybe.... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now we must not.... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That very word suggests that he is not to that stage where he can see Nārāyaṇa everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the highest statement of a Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...therefore there is character. Just like there are some terpinoids(?) or some, so many. If little change is there, immediately the color changes, the flavor change. And who adjusted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There they find Kṛṣṇa, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That has been.... I was already telling you, that three colors...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They say that "Now we are scientists. We do not require God." Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are putting, I mean.... The putting of a small leaf in a hydrocarbon.... You can't put it from that. To that step we have come in biochemistry or chemistry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they should admit who has adjusted it. Then who has adjusted like this, so that the color, the flavor, everything is maintained standard? That is real scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Svabhāva hatu pravar.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Svabhāva</span> means <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> So <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛti [Bg. 9.10].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So under His guidance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So matter cannot work. <span class="Italic">Yasyājñayā...</span> There is a verse in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā. Sṛṣṭi-sthiti.... Svabhāva</span> is Durgā. <span class="Italic">Sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā, icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> By His desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, sir, He desired and said, "Let Me be many," and He became many. So by desire the whole cosmos has come into existence. So by desire the colors change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even there.... Coconut trees, there are varieties. One tree is standing like this; one is standing like this. Varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But then one thing, <span class="Italic">eko bahū...</span> Everything that is..., the Vaiṣṇava fulfillment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Vaiṣṇava accepts the varieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He accept the variety but he sees in Him everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Variety is everywhere. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
