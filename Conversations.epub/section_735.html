<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...looks better, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Than that Bombay idea? Yes, I think so also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is...? Saurabha has gone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He's in Vṛndāvana. He's coming back here tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it should be changed. Sitting idea is not to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, it's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...forget to tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I'll tell him definitely, Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They are teaching communistic philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We went there to try to sell them some books. They were very hostile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hostile.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why hostile?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Communistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are scientific men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They say it's research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Science, social science... Research. Research means they don't know. Just like Bon Mahārāja. Research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Research.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Research and research but still don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] If one is fool, where is the question of searching out? If he has got the right knowledge, why there should be searching? Searching means he is not in knowledge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It may be true that we have no knowledge, but we don't think we need God to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Maybe" means rascal. As soon as you say "maybe," you are a rascal, immediately. There is no other argument. As soon as you say "maybe," that means you are a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, definitely we don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore rascal. (laughter) Therefore rascal. We definitely know Kṛṣṇa, the origin of everything. That is definite, not "It may be." We don't say "Kṛṣṇa may be." No. Definitely. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> Here is Bhagavān. Here is God. That is definite. Therefore our professor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Who has written foreword to my <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Dimmock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dimmock. "Here is definitive..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitai:</span> "Definitive edition."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Definitive edition." That is the credit. Not "may be." No "maybe," sir. That is rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In our social science we find that God is only necessary to define the unknown. Otherwise He has no purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our God is not unknown. Known. We know God's residence. We know God's father, God's mother, God's activities, God's friends. Everything we know. There is no "maybe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just like in the former days when the savages saw thunderbolts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The savage... You may be savage. We are not savage. You may be savage, but we are not savage. We are civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Therefore we don't have so many unknown things, so we don't need God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We're civilized, so we have so many things we know now, so we don't need God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we know everything. Who says we do not know? We know everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I'm playing the part... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We know everything. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idam vijñātaṁ bhavanti.</span> This is the Vedic statement. If you know God, then you know everything. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam idam vijñātam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The materialists think, though, that the less you know, the more you need God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The less you know, the more you need God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say they are rascal and fools. This is the... What is this "House of Soviet Culture"? So why don't you arrange a meeting here? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> A nice place for a meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's the best place for a meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is Soviet culture? We shall challenge them. Yes. We can challenge them because we know they are rascals. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Religion is simply to keep people satisfied, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Religion is simply to keep people satisfied. It's the "opiate of the masses."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but you have no satisfaction even. Your culture is so bad that you are not satisfied even. Then you are better. Everyone is looking after satisfaction. So you have no satisfaction even. So you are less than animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, at least everybody is not satisfied equally, so there's no envy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are, everybody is not learned, everybody is rascal. Therefore he is not satisfied. If one is in knowledge he is satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But religion is just sentimentality. There's no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know what is religion. Therefore we do not accept sentimental religion. We say it is cheating. Such kind of religion, we say it is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You can't eat religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> If you spend all your days just chanting, how can you eat? Religion means you go to the church and you just pray.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And who says that religionists should not eat? Do we say...? We have ample <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to eat. It is already there. You are researching after food, starving dog. We don't research. There is food ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But we're just exploiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bada day maya, karibāre jihv jaya, sva-prasāda anna dilo bhāi.</span> Kṛṣṇa is ready. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> as much as you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The Communists will say we're just exploiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Communists may say, but we don't say. They are hungry people, they may say. We are not hungry. Our food is supplied by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> He brings food. So why should the Communists? So we shall go further or return? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Do you want to go further, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I can go. What is time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Almost seven. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This is Curzon Road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Curzon Road. [break] ...religion, we say "cheating religion." We don't accept sentimentally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, the sentiment is the faith. The dictionary definition, sentimentalism is the faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Faith is good, provided you have faith on the superior. That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So faith in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Knowledge means received from the superior. Like the child gets knowledge from the father. That kind of faith is required. If the child does not believe the statement of father and mother, he cannot make any progress. If the child does not believe the statement of mother, he does not know who is his father. So there must be faith, faith in the right person. Then it is all right. If you have got faith in the person who has got eyes to lead you, then he will help you to cross the road. And if you put your faith to another blind man like you, then it will cause disaster. Faith is required, but to the right person. Then it will be all right. You know that one barber is honest: then you can make your neck like this and he is with a sharpened razor. But you have faith that "He will not cut my throat; he will shave me." This is faith. And if you do not know him and if you put your neck like this and if he is a rogue, he will cut your throat. That's all. The same faith, if you put it to the right person, you become cleansed, shaved, and the same faith put in the wrong person-your throat is cut off. So you must know where to put the faith. So our Vedic injunction is: "Put your faith to the <span class="Italic">brahma-nistam,</span> one who is God-realized." <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet samit-paniḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭam: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "One who has full knowledge in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and firmly fixed up in Brahman, God, you put your faith there." Otherwise there will be disaster. Right faith. [break] ...you call Prabhakara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> I called him on the phone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejās:</span> Yes. I don't know why he didn't come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So actually the one thing that makes Kṛṣṇa consciousness different from other religious processes is the practical application of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Full knowledge, perfect knowledge. And other religious systems, they have no knowledge. They say of God something but they do not know what is God. We know what is God and who is God. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> But they have no pure devotee in which to put their faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They have no one in which to put their faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they may be, put because they do not know God, therefore it is cheating. Just see, India's capital and so dirty thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You were saying about Eisenhower and Nehru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nehru was trying to hide the villages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But any intelligent man can understand. Any foreigner who will come will understand how India is poverty-stricken by this picture. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It seems like the strongest preaching point or platform is the presence of a pure soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The presence of a pure soul, someone who is wrapped up actually in love of God, is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Faithful servant of God. He can preach. He is authorized. He has got the power of attorney. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa śakti vin nahe nāma pracāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I was thinking on Juhu Beach, these men have been walking by now for four years, and actually none of them have heard you speak, or maybe a few, but now they are all coming and touching your feet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] ...two-year visas now, they must have more faith in you now, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They must have more faith in you now in India because they're giving us two-year visa. Faith must be improving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...in the right person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should have that knowledge, that we are doing the best service to the humanity. It is better late than never. [break] ...position so they may not lose their faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Position should be pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Remain pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Earth teachers. (?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...next conference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> They're all trying to learn Russian here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, for when the Russians come and take over their country. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the talk amongst the high-court judges. So when there was fierce fighting was going on between the Germans and the Allies, so during their relaxed hours, the judges were sitting. So one, the Chief Justice of Calcutta, he asked one Justice Mukherjee. So Justice Mukherjee was very... He was vice-chancellor. So he asked him, "Mr. Mukherjee, now the Germans are coming. What you will do when they come?" He said, "Yes, as soon as they come, we shall: 'Come on sir, come on sir, come on sir.' We shall receive them." "Why?" "Now, you have taught us like that. You British people, you have taught us. (laughter) Our business is to receive. Anyone comes, we shall receive him. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> And they will do the same with the Russians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It seems like they are preparing now by eating lots of meat and drinking a lot of alcohol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot prepare us. That is the difference. Even they are preparing, but they cannot prepare us. That is the difference between fools and man with knowledge. [break] ...was existing? No. New temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I don't know. They're still in the process of building it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Yes. Make <span class="Italic">samosa</span> and <span class="Italic">halavā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> For lunch?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> For lunch. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I couldn't follow the numbers. I just heard that so much for sleeping, so much for the toilet, so much... The noise of the machine... I couldn't follow the years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Out of hundred years, fifty years-sleeping. And fifty years balance twenty years-playing. And twenty years-old age, invalid. And ten years-frustration. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> Prabhupāda said Prahlāda Mahārāja said (unclear).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Hundred years finished and then become a dog. This is civilization. You got the hundred years for getting out of these material clutches, <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhī [Bg. 13.9],</span> but one will not do that. How spoiling civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Fifth Canto it is very nicely described how for each sinful activity a person goes to a separate type of hellish planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not accept this, such a foolish person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any sane man, if he found out what the consequences will be, he would listen to the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not believe next life, that, to dismiss all these ideas. If there is no next life... <span class="Italic">Bhasmi bhūtasya</span>... Atheists, they do not believe next life. All big, big men in Europe, they say, "No, there is no life." Here also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They will say, "We have no evidence, no evidence of..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Evidence is there. Still, you are so rascal. Evidence is you were a child. That is the evidence. Where is that body? A very simple evidence, but these rascals are so dull, they cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They accept what is good for their sense gratification, and what is not good, they won't accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is sense gratification? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Everything is unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle, and unmanifest at the end. So why should I care for anything in this lifetime?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> If it's all unmanifest in the beginning, it's only manifest in the middle, and it's unmanifest again at the end, why should I care about anything this life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are making so much arrangement for sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, I can enjoy while I've got it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why... If it is not manifested, what is the enjoyment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Harikeśa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> No, Subhaga has spoken to me, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's better to enjoy than to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is enjoyment? The thief also thinks like that: "Let me enjoy by stealing." Then, when he goes to the prison, then his enjoyment finished. If somebody gives you so many <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> that "You take this <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> and after finishing, I shall beat you with shoes," then will you take? (laughter) This is enjoyment. No sane man will like to enjoy like that. "Take this <span class="Italic">rasagullā,</span> and after this, I will beat you with shoes, as many <span class="Italic">rasagullā</span> you have taken." Will you take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but I eat <span class="Italic">rasagullās</span> every day and nobody beats me with shoes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the other day you told me, "I am now not... I cannot see. My brain is..."? Is it not beating with shoes? (laughter) Eh? Don't you agree?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (5):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Everyone, but they are so rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One famous psychologist, psychiatrist, said there is a pleasure and pain principle, that everyone wants as much pleasure as possible and as little pain as possible. So because we have to suffer and enjoy, why not make enjoyment as much as possible and reduce the suffering? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are vacant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, they look occupied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...big building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Some kind of auditorium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harisauri:</span> [break] Art.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Art. Some art. Art, music</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's very enjoyable to hear music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. [break] So why don't you come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Haryana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and take information.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I don't know if this is their offices. We'll check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Take immediately that. No, no, what is this?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They must cooperate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] The problem that these foreign, some of these foreign devotees that have come lately, they have been such loose devotees that the temple presidents, they want to get rid of them; they are sending them to India. Three people came from Rūpānuga's zone; and they were all useless devotees. They won't listen. They just ran away from Bombay. So I wrote a very strong letter to Rūpānuga Prabhu. I said, you know, they should screen the devotees before they send them to India. What they are doing is they are sending their rejected devotees to India. If any devotee is not good in their zone they say, "Okay, we'll send them to India." But here we have such big projects that we need devotees who will follow the rules strictly and who will listen to authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So tell them. If they have rejected and you also reject them, where they will go? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we will train them, but these devotees don't cooperate very much. (end)</div>
