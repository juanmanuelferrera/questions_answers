<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> You want a <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> for...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What for the <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To water the <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See is there any <span class="Italic">loṭā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No <span class="Italic">loṭā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See how <span class="Italic">aparādhī,</span> offender. They have used that <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> for watering. Great offender. This is going on, <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't know whose <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> that is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I don't know whose <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> that is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know. It has been used for watering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ramesvara:</span> Prabhupāda discovered, it came from the bathroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that rascals? Huh? Who took it from the bathroom, toilet room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was in the toilet room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You do not know? You have not used that loṭā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You never use that toilet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, not since you've been using it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Since you've been using it I have never entered that toilet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. Before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Before that, <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> wasn't there. There was another <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> for the bathroom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who kept that <span class="Italic">loṭā?</span> I used that <span class="Italic">loṭā.</span> I know. I was acquainted with this <span class="Italic">loṭā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That was your personal, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Personal... Before I used that toilet, the <span class="Italic">loṭā</span> was there. No, one who has used that, he has no sense how to water <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> plant. He should be instructed, who has done it, that "You never use that toilet <span class="Italic">loṭā</span>." [break] ...observing fast day today?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Moonrise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...ist countries they accept a leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do they not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So before they became communist, they had some leader or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the Czar in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Czar was the leader in Russia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> And Chiang Kai-shek in China.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they changed their leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was a revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> People were unsatisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> People were not satisfied with the government. There was a revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, people were not satisfied... The principle, what is the principle? To have better leader. Is it not? So if they get still better leader, why they will not change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They would say it's not the leader but it's the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever... The system is done by some leaders. Anything... Just like our, this system we have introduced. I am the leader. Similarly, a leader is changed for betterment of the situation. So if the communists and those who have brain, if they find a better leader for better situation, why they'll not? And they want for revolution also. They are in favor of revolution. Their theory is that periodically there must be revolution. That is their theory. I talked with Professor Kotovsky. So why they will not accept another revolution for further advancement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> One of the main problems I can see is to divorce our movement from religious concept because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not the question of religious concept. This is nonsense. You have to... Just like when Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span>-that is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>-so does it mean a religion? Then why these nonsense take it as religion? It is a fact. How you can neglect the fact? Eh? <span class="Italic">Kaumāraṁ yauvanam jara.</span> A baby becoming a boy, boy becoming a young man, is it religion? Either Hindu or Muslim or Christian or Buddha, everyone is becoming like that. Where is religion? Why do they take it as religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It's religion because it's not empirical fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It's not an empirical fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that empirical fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That after you die, you take another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from that, why, how the baby is becoming a boy? This is a fact. How a baby is becoming a child, a child is becoming a boy, a boy is becoming young man, a young man is becoming middle aged? Does it mean... Is it a particular type of religious system? Why this nonsense? What kind of intelligent person they are? It is a fact. Now we come to the old age. So I have come to the point of old age body after so many stages. Then where is the next? The next is <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara:</span> he'll get another body. This is very common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They won't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means a rascal. Why should you not...? You answer, then what is next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say he is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how it can be finished? How it can be finished? If you have come stage by stage by stage... It is finished to your eyes. Just like the sunshine is there. "In the evening there will be no more sun; it is finished." What is this nonsense? Is it finished? A rascal may say it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Out of sight, they say it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this thing you have to convince them. Why should you allow them to remain a rascal? Now the sun is rising. Does it mean all of a sudden a sun is created? So these are the examples. You have to preach like that. Simply believe your eyes? You believe also there was no sun; now it is sun. That means all of a sudden a sun became created. See the intelligent persons and convince them. <span class="Italic">Yad yad ācārati śreṣṭhaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Pick up the best man. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He picked up the best men, Sanātana Gosvāmī, Rūpa Gosvāmī. So His movement became successful. Sanātana Gosvāmī was not an ordinary man. Very educated, learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and minister, Caitanya Mahāprabhu picked up. Similarly Rūpa Gosvāmī, similarly Jīva Gosvāmī. Picked up means by His preaching they became converted. So similarly pick up a person like Sanātana Gosvāmī, intelligent, in position, and try to convince him. Why he will not be convinced, if he's a human being? This is not religion. That I am breathing, what is this breathing? Eh? What is the breathing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Air going in and out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, when the breathing is stopped, why don't you manufacture some machine that breathing will come again? Why you cannot do it? Everyone knows it is air. Put some machine within and let there be breathing. Tell me why you cannot do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They have some machines like that, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are another rascal. Who is this rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They have some machines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And don't spoil time like that, "They have got a machine." What is that machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Machines are not living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And don't create unnecessary talks. What is that machine? They have a machine? What is that nonsense machine? Eh? Who knows that machine? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> It's called an air respirator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But can it bring life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of that machine? What is the use of that machine? Everyone knows that it is air. Now air is stopped. That is my reject(?). Bring that air again. There is ample air. Bring that machine. Simply... Similarly, if you analyze the whole body, it is confirmed, you will find these five elements, that 's all, earth, water, air, fire, sky. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's scientific. No one denies that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They why don't you create a body? What is your science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You've just pointed out: the body may already be there, but they cannot replace the life. Even a body is already created, like a dead body, but they can't bring life back into it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is that life? That is the question. That life is soul. You have to accept. [break] ...car stop. Some machine broken. As soon as the machine is placed, now the motor car is fit for running, but not for the machine, but for the driver. When the driver is not there, you cannot create or purchase a driver. That is not possible. You can repair the machine, but without driver the machine will not run. So why they should be blind about this fact? What is this knowledge, advancement of knowledge? The body is created. If it is accepted-body is created by these material elements-now create another body. Just like dollmakers make a body, you also make a body, very beautiful woman, and give it life. Why they cannot do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But even accepting that the soul is the living force, they may say that "Well, we're living in this material world and we have to deal with matter, so what is the importance of all this knowledge?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They may say that "We're living in the material world in spite of this knowledge, so we have to deal with material circumstances."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you do not like to die. Why do you die with your material knowledge? Nobody wants to die but why you die? Then where is your material knowledge. You do not like to be old man. Where is your material knowledge that you can stop old age? Then you have to accept that your material knowledge is not perfect. Why you are so much proud of this false knowledge? Unnecessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we don't see that you are able to stop death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We agree that it would be nice to stop death, but where is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, we know. You learn from us. We know. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavananda:</span> But we haven't seen that anyone in your movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again "seeing," condemned seeing. Your seeing is like that, that "The sun has come all of a sudden." That is your seeing. "And when the sun is not there, the sun dead." That is your seeing. This is rascal seeing, animal seeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Then you want us to have faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No faith. It is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If I can't see, then it means faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can't see. You are rascal; how you will see? Just like an astrologer can say it is going to happen. You cannot see, but he can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That means I have to have faith, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not faith. It is fact. If I say that "At 6:30 in the evening there will be no sun," it is not faith; it is fact. But a rascal does not say... "No, why? The sun is there. Why there will be no sun?" But intelligent man will say, "No, there will be no sun." It is neither astrology, neither anything. It is knowledge. You have no knowledge; you do not know. I have knowledge; I can tell. That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But I must believe that knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are rascal, "I believe." Learn how to believe it, how to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But I have another teacher who can teach me something I can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā. Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā.</span> If you have got knowledge, then you can see. But you have no knowledge. How you can see? Therefore you have to go to a person where you get the knowledge. Then you will see. Another example is that in the desert the animal is seeing there is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Mirage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is seeing. And the man knows that there is no water. That is the difference between animal and man. The animal cannot see. The man can see. So become a perfect man. Then you'll see everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Another example you give. When we see the sun it looks like a small disk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many examples. Why you believe your rascal eyes? Why you are proud of seeing? You cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They may say in relation to that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got the same eyes, but when it is dark you cannot see. Then what is the value of your eyes? You see under condition. That is not absolute. [break] ...should be informed that why you have changed? Now, the Russian and Chinese, first of all they began believing Lenin or Marx.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Marx was the original.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are not in agreement. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They saw practically... It was impractical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means for advancement of knowledge you have to change. They accept this theory, revolution. So if you get better situation, why you'll not change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They accept a better theory when it is presented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is presented. This is the beginning, that "Your knowledge is imperfect. You are believing your eyes, but that is not perfect knowledge. You have to see with knowledge." <span class="Italic">Paśyati jñāna... Paśyanti jñāna-cakṣuṣā. Śāstra-cakṣuṣāt.</span> That is seeing, not seeing like a child. A child is seeing, a motor car is running, a airplane is running. He thinks a wonderful machine, but it is not the machine. It is the pilot. It is the driver. A child cannot see it. The father knows that it is not the machine. The machine may be however perfectly made; it cannot run. There must be a perfect pilot also. Just like we get on aeroplane. There are hundreds of men. If there is any trouble, then the pilot can stop it, not the hundreds of men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> In these Communist countries, Śrīla Prabhupāda, such as Russia...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Communist country, everywhere, a pilot is required. Not Communist country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every country has a leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So these... All this ism, Communism, this ism, this ism, beginning from that Greek history, so many changes have been made in Europe, leaders, sometimes Napoleon, sometimes Mussolini, sometimes Hitler. It is going on. So where is the perfect situation? You have changed so many leaders for so many years in the history, but where is your perfect situation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have one leader, and our situation is perfect, and we are not changing that leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is perfection. We have taken Kṛṣṇa as leader. We are not taking any other leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> In thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hundreds and thousands of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So many constitutions, they have been amended so many times. But the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has not been amended since so many millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It cannot be amended. Just like this rule, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> When the change of body, how you can change the rule? A perfect definition. You cannot change it. [break] ...religion, the so-called religion, it is changed. Formerly there was no Christianity and now Christianity. Now, from Christianity, so many others, so many others. That is not religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> If you say that your leader is perfect and you do not change your leader, we see that in India... This is where Kṛṣṇa came. He is your leader, but they do not follow Kṛṣṇa any more and India is in trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the right thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But why do they not follow if He is perfect leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They argue like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their misfortune. Just like father says, "Child do this," but he does not do. Father says, "Don't touch fire;" he touches, so he'll suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They can also say that about their leader. They can say that according to Marx, if everyone followed Marx purely, then the Communist system would be running on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, what is the purity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, the pure Communist philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that pure Communist philosophy? State. We state, "This is our philosophy." What is the Marx philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ultimately, they say there should be no leader. Everything will work automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have leader, rascal. Why do you say no leader? Immediately take shoes and beat with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They say that in the future there will be no leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again beat threes, thrice. But we are not so fool that we are going to believe in your future postdated check. We are not so fool. Present right check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't accept blindly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately payable. Then we accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will accept that there has to be a leader...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must have. They must have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But the leader should not be a person which is held in esteem for his personality but simply a person who is guiding the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Then that is Kṛṣṇa. He is giving this leader. This is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And their leader can never be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The Communist leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can become perfect if you follow a perfect leader. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Just like some gurus say there is no need of guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The trouble is, their system is not perfect. Our system is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it can be? Because the leader who introduced this system is a rascal, so how the system can be perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like you pointed out yesterday that Communism holds that everyone should have an equal right, but, you pointed out, then why do they limit that simply to human beings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is imperfect system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they become sectarian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say this is the natural development. When a system develops to this size there will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you cannot change, natural development. You rascal, why you become leader? I don't require your leadership if everything is going on by nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, it requires a guide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because you are rascal, you are under nature. So how you can guide me? Your position is the same. You are blind; I am blind. How you can lead me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They won't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they won't say means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I accept a blind leader? If a blind... I am blind, and if a blind man says, "Come on, I shall guide you," why shall I accept that leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Their contention is not that, though. Their contention is that Mao Tse Tung, along with being the political leader, is also the spiritual guide of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Political, social is not. The leader must be perfect. If the leader is blind, how can I accept such blind leader? I am blind man. What is the use? I am blind; therefore I am asking, "Can you help me to cross the road?" Another blind, "Yes, yes, come on, I shall." Why shall I accept? First of all I shall ask, "You have got eyes?" "No, I am also blind." What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Do they admit their leader to be blind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No. They use their leader's book as Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you change? Why you change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They don't change. They follow Mao.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They... They say there is necessity of revolution. The Communist theory they accept, that periodically there is need of revolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> But it all culminates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That's not to change. That's not to change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have change, change of the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, that's not to change the system. That's to purify it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That change of the leader...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> That's to purge the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Continuous purification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's means... Purge out means it is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, they will say that in any system...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...over the years they are dealing with millions of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but if I can give you any system which is perfect, why you'll not accept it? Why you are so fool?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Then, if you can give a system that people will not deviate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Any system people can deviate from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, deviate, that you have got independence to deviate from anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So that is the imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So they will say that is the imperfection in Communism, also, that the system is perfect but we have imperfect people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if there is an ism where there is no such defects, why should you not accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But there is defects, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They can point out even within our own movement the different people who don't follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Don't follow but the system is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they'll say their system is also perfect, but there's some that don't follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> No, but their system is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That you have to establish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So it didn't save the man who created it. The man who founded the philosophy, it didn't save him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> What does it mean the saving? He died like everyone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Saving means saving from lust and all these things. There's so much... They're servants of their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone requires leader, yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So they are changing leaders one after another because they think that the present leader will satisfy their present desires more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The leader, perfect leader, is God. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānāṁ</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> That <span class="Italic">nitya</span> and <span class="Italic">cetana,</span> all living entities, we are eternal, and we are conscious. And He is the supreme conscious. Therefore God means Supreme Being. You take His leadership. Then He'll properly guide you. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, actually, I think it was either Marx or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But the leader says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja, ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "I shall give you protection from all pitfalls." This is. We also accept leader, but the most perfect leader, who can actually give me protection from all dangers. So Śrīdhara, when you go, you take some letters from me. So what happened about Ganguli? [break] ...this nature. Just like a child is born. Immediately requires protection by mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What... Śrīla Prabhupāda, what are the qualifications of a perfect leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No mistake, no illusion, no cheating, no imperfection. Anyone who commits mistake, he's illusioned, he's a cheater and imperfect-he cannot lead. So bring any leader of these rascal groups and test with these four principles; he is misleader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They're all servants of their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will also say that within our movement the so-called leaders also have imperfections.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say, within our movement, that the leaders also have imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> No imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say, "Yes, we can give you examples."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no. Why? Why you shall accept? They will say. Because therefore they are saying, we shall accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here's Prabhupāda. Here's Prabhupāda</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The so-called leaders, maybe they are imperfect, but the real leader, He is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is test of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say, "He is also makes mistakes."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is that mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have not seen any mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Where is the mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What would you define...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you think your leader is mistaken, then you are mistaken. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Like a mirror. You see a mistake but it's yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The leader of mistake-therefore immediately gives evidence from <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> What is the use of quoting from the <span class="Italic">śāstra?</span> "Just to prove that I am not mistaken, here is the proof."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They would say that there is a way of life which is perfect, but all men are imperfect. There is a way of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore they... Because you are imperfect, therefore you have to accept the leadership of a perfect person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will say no one is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is the... That is your ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have never seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, just like blind man says, "Nobody is with eyes. Because I am blind, so everyone is blind." <span class="Italic">Ātmavat manyate jagat.</span> That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the whole thing is actually nonsense because Marx himself in his old age became senile and died in a crazy condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he must be. He was crazy always. Many, many leaders die like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Every leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They will point out that our <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> also died. You say that Marx died, so they will say, "Your <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> also died."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dying, that... There is difference of dying. But nobody, he died... They did not die a crazy. That is the superexcellence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he died gloriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not only that, that he prepared himself, "Now I am going to die. Now I am sleeping. You just pierce with your arrow." So where is that death? Even that death is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's glorified from time immemorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Like Haridāsa Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually it is not death, but if you take it as death, that is also glorified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Look at Lord Caitanya's disappearance. Wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A leader means that he's following a system. So what are the criterion of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That already told. He does not commit any mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not illusioned, he is not a cheater, and he is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So now you've defined a perfect leader. What is a perfect system? What are the criterion for a perfect system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect system means from which we do not suffer. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the main criterion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are always hankering after happiness. So we do not like suffering. So if there is no suffering, that is perfect system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can you point out any time in history when there existed such a perfect system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is always existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Otherwise why you are sticking to this? This is the proof. You are all young men, you have given up everything. Why you are sticking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatinandana:</span> In the West so many young men are joining different groups?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may be rascals. Therefore, therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu... [break] ...told me it is full. But people coming and going, it looks very nice.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Canakya Paṇḍita says, <span class="Italic">putra-hīnaṁ gṛhaṁ śūnyam:</span> "In a home where there is no children, sons and daughters, it is zero."</div>
