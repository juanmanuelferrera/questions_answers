<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First try to point out as many as you can. And our view is they are wholesale mistaken. They are imperfect, speculating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There's one strange point here about calculating this that dawn of Brahmā about two billion years old. Now strangely these geological calculations, they also claim that at that time the first free oxygen in the air appeared, first time. The beginning there was no free oxygen. We can accept that? (laughter) Now from here, anyway, this is the basic point, that once this oxygen appeared, free oxygen, then the living entities began to appear slowly. That is the whole theory of this chemical evolution. The results for the chronology is just put it that dawn of Brahmā is two billion years old?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can carefully read the Second Canto, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> Third Canto. You'll get all the knowledge, how things develop. It is a question of development. So maybe there was something missing, but after development it is manifested there. That is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> In the day of, one day of Brahmā, there are fourteen Manus. And in the course of creation, re-creation of the same species from the previous day-they are re-creating the same species-it takes, there's some time, maybe one Manu, there's some species that are finished, but the next Manu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That doesn't mean time. What is this Manu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, no, I'm saying this is what really happened, right? So we were thinking that we could show one day, this is one day, one day of Brahmā...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you do not think what is actually there, you can say. You do not be a speculator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, no, but from the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> we have taken it, and broken down the day of Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whether they will accept it or not, that is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We don't worry about whether they accept it or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, but we have taken that they are talking all nonsense. And whatever we present, they'll take it as mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> But like Mādhava Prabhu pointed out, we have to make some explanation. We should explain because they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you do, but the position is like this. Our conclusion is that whatever they are saying, that is imperfect. That is not possible. And that is a fact. Therefore they change, after fifty years, they change. Because it's speculation. Therefore we say totally they are wrong, and they will take totally "From mythology," like that, this is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Now one aspect in that, now in Christian group also, some are trying to preach that these things are created by God, but they have a problem there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact, everything is created by God. It is being done by one, that Supreme. We are simply studying how it is acting. Otherwise everything is being done by Him. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> That is a fact. How He is working so nicely, that is the subject matter of our study, or something is explained in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> or something has been studied by these material scientists, but the things are being done by the supreme arrangement of manager. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The difficulty in this Christian aspect is that they claim that it was created about five thousand years ago. That is the reason why we want to bring up this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nonsense. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> These Creationists preach that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, Creationists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Gish(?) preaches that? Five thousand years ago, literally? Do we want to make this comparison, Śrīla Prabhupāda, or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are going to fight with them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, no. We don't fight. We're just saying that they are using all the good arguments already, but they are making that one mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Fundamental mistake, there. So if we bring up this, scientist are going to believe here, more likely to believe, because this is (indistinct) in the time range that they are talking about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long. As soon as there is five thousand years, they will (indistinct). The Christian theory used to say that the world is flat. So what is the value of their words? There is no value. You do not try to compromise with others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, we are not compromising with anybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You present your own as it is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> try to explain them to your best capacity scientifically. If you bring this, bring that... All of them are imperfect. So what is the use of wasting time with something which is imperfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We want to demonstrate that those points are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We want to demonstrate, though, that those points are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do, but you must know they are all imperfect. Five thousand years! We can give history of millions and millions of years. And what was before five thousand years, there was no, nothing? What is their (indistinct), reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What do they say, the Christians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> They don't say too much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Want to make any more points along that line?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> One thing is, just like here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, these are our Manus, the real situation, right? And their time scale begins back here, Cambrian Age. Back here in Vaivasvata Manu's age, according to <span class="Italic">Veda.</span> So we were showing, we made the actual time scale, and showed how their time scale only went back one or two Manus. (aside) Is that right? How many Manus? Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Manus? There is seventy-two into 432,000 years. So they are calculating five thousand years... What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> No, the Christians calculate, but the others, they go back more than that time. The scientists... These Christians are not accepted so much as.... They're not included in scientific knowledge; they are considered something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is that the Christian theory is also imperfect and the scientists also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We can show both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you can show that, that is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> That is why we made this chart...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> ...to show...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Show them imperfect. That will be... [break] Actually they're imperfect. Just like they say five thousand years, a ludicrous. They, and the scientists say that the stratum of earth, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Strata, layers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Layers. And I was telling my colleague that stratus, the layers so perfect that everywhere, say five inches, just like it appears somebody has laid down. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Yes. Layer upon layer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, one after another, the same height, same color, the same ingredient-how it comes to happen? And they give history of millions of years? And these people say five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> We were wondering about those strata. We were wondering if maybe those could be masses of sediment deposited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, the side height of the strata is the same for miles together. As if somebody very intelligently laid down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So how do we explain that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I want. (laughter) How they can say five thousand years? Things are going on for millions and millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> The geologists say that in different strata, they give names for the strata, and in one strata they say that there is one type of animal remains to be found, and another strata they say you find the remains of a different kind of animal. So they say this shows evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, it takes millions of years. So how they say five thousand years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> Well, no one really believes the Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> They are laughed at actually. The scientists, how far do they say? Five hundred million?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> The scientists say it goes back six hundred million years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also imperfect. If we study Brahmā's day, it will be all... Brahmā's day is, one day equal to forty-three hundred thousands of years multiplied by thousand, that is Brahmā's one day. So thirty days, one month, and twelve months equal to year, such hundred years. Your mathematics will fail to figure out. Is it not? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> There is a slide of this, but we did not show you. The idea is that this is the beginning of Brahmā's day up to present, Vaivasvata Manu. This is the beginning of time according to them. They can't explain anything up to here. They say here, in the middle of the day of Raivata Manu, they begin their Cambrian Age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why Raivata Manu? They are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We're here, and this is the previous Manu, and before him the other Manu, and it's back here that they say their geological records begin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they say, whatever we say, which one is correct? Who will say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We will say. We are correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll say, they will say "I am correct."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Then the reader must decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We will say that they are wrong and we want to find out the reason for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> From here to here is the chemical evolution, there's a long gap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sadāpūta:</span> I was wondering, perhaps these periods that they have here correspond with some of these floods, like this is between two Manus and there is a flood of the whole world, and that might pile up a huge layer of mud and rock. And I was thinking that might correspond with some of these layers here because they are filled with remains of fish that look as though they were buried, things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also imagination. Again you are bringing imagination, speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So actually it's very subtle and critical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as you bring your imaginations, they'll bring their own imagination. "Perhaps," "It may be," they say</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Our imagination is as good as your imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are to take the Vedic injunction axiomatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So how do we, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're talking about all these things, this time, and we just give our time scale from Brahmā, that's perfectly, that is on <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We know from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> it tells what creations went on during these periods, we can show the real creation of the universe, not that we care about their ideas. But these different Manus, there were different species created. Like Dakṣa recreated a time. From one Manu to the next the species were recreated again by him, we can show that in this chart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But one problem that we're going to encounter, always though, this will come up, they will bring up this thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> We just say your time starts only not long enough ago and ours goes back to the beginning of the day. We can criticize them that theirs does not go back far enough. What else can we say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We will fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You made a good point yesterday when you were seeing the slideshow that how can they possibly calculate a time like two million years or two billion years when they only live fifty or sixty years themselves? How can they possibly come up with a calculation like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> To verify, scientific, they cannot measure it. But our information comes from persons who were living at those times. They lived, historical persons. We don't need some modern man who lives fifty years to tell us what happened fifty million years ago. We know someone who was there. That is our advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
