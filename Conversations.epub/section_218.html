<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> San Diego is very close to the border of Mexico, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. [break] ...the cemetery of dog, one becomes dog. Yes, that is stated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b><i class="calibre3"> Yānti bhūtāni bhūtejyā.</i> "The worshiper of this<i class="calibre3"> bhūta</i> goes to the <i class="calibre3">bhūta.</i>" <i class="calibre3">Mad-yājino 'pi yānti mām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 9.25]<i class="calibre3">. </i>"And those who are worshiper of Me, they come to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> A good reason. If you worship Kṛṣṇa, go to Kṛṣṇa. If you worship the dog, you go to dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> <i class="calibre3">Māyāvādīs,</i> they say you can worship anything and it is all the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Do the <i class="calibre3">Māyāvādīs</i> say you can worship anything and it is all the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. (chuckles) That is their nonsense. Kṛṣṇa says different thing, but they have manufactured their own way. Is that a temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It's a nice gold dome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It appears as church. It is a church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes. I do not know what kind. Christian church. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Kṛṣṇa has endowed California with a lot of natural beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> All year around there is nice flowers and green.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And you know how to utilize them. Therefore, Kṛṣṇa has given you this land. Now utilize it and develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It will be heaven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> We could have an idea like you have in India on the beach for rich people to come and learn Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It's a very beautiful spot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Like Bombay. Such an idea, it would be very nice here for all the rich, artists, intelligent people, everybody to come and rest and learn Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Let them learn there and implement the idea here. The whole city, whole country will be glorified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b><i class="calibre3"> Jaya.</i> We need to have more cow protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> On the West Coast, it would be very nice if we had some cow protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> These people must stop this cow killing, the greatest sin. They should divert their tendency for happiness differently than by killing and drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> They are thinking they cannot live without eating cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> They think they cannot live without eating cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> They do not know. We can teach them how to get better vitaminous foodstuff from cow's milk. Yes. Let the cow live, and she supplies her blood in the form of milk, and you take vitaminous foodstuff from milk. That is civilization. Milk is also cow's blood. But take this blood in a humanely way, not by killing. Milk is nothing but blood of cow. Suppose if you kill one cow, you get blood how much, how many pounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Some number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, just guess, how many pounds blood you can get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Fifty pounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Fifty pounds. But if you keep the cows, you get thirty pounds daily. This is intelligence. Instead of getting once fifty pounds and finished, why don't you get it daily thirty pounds?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Because they're lusty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> We have to set the example, Prabhupāda, through your mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. This is foolishness. Just like one has got some money, he utilizes his money and gets daily some income. And if he wants to spend all at once, that is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Now they think they are smart. They think they can mass produce animals and mass kill them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Mass killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Mass killing. That is... They have factories where they can produce thousands of animals very quickly. Quickly they inject certain vitamins and so on in the animal so that they become fat very fast for mass killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> How they can produce thousands of animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi: </b>They're producing animals in the laboratories, not with... <i class="calibre3">They're</i> not producing, they are utilizing nature's way, but they don't let the animals see the green and the grass or the outside. They keep them in the barn and just keep feeding them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> I don't think it is possible. It is simply imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> It's the cows which are producing each other, it's not the man that is producing. But they artificially try to make them fat fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And what is the harm if they live?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Excuse me, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> There is enough grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> This is a nice park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Someday we will put on a nice Hare Kṛṣṇa festival here in this park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> We shall park here, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What do you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> If you would like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> This is a long drive, Śrīla Prabhupāda. It just goes very scenic drive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> We could walk for some time, walk along the beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Then we can drive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Yes. (exits car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> Someday by Kṛṣṇa's grace we'll put a big festival right here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> ...forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa. When there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is no longer material. That is spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</b> Those of us who have been blessed by your teachings, we still are conditioned to forget Kṛṣṇa. It's very painful when we forget. I know myself, I am still a rascal. It's very difficult when I forget. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> It is your duty to give protection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Devotee (1):</b> When he was very small, he came back from the temple one Sunday chanting and dancing, and finally we went to see what it was. (end)</div>
