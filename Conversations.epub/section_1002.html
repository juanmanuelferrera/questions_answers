<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The whole thing is being done in one week. I just got the whole text from Nirañjana on Sunday from England. We've got it composed, it is going into printing tomorrow, it will be ready by <span class="Italic">Vyāsa-Pūjā.</span> It's a Hindi <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> on Janmāṣṭamī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nirañjana is helping to translate it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, and he's the most reliable. The others I find are not reliable. Even with Yaśomatīnandana, I give him a book, it gets stuck for three months. But now we are moving very fast. The first Hindi <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> we printed up forty-five thousand, it is sold. So I'm reprinting thirty thousand more in Delhi, and in Bombay, we are producing a new <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> with thirty thousand first print. Forty-five thousand of first printing is almost sold. People can't believe it. Even Hitsharan Sharma couldn't believe it that we distributed forty-five thousand Hindi magazines in two months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are distributing millions in English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We got a new import permit to import books for five <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> I think I wrote that to you. And also the government is going to let us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw your wife in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. She's in Dallas now. Also the government is going to give us permission to import paper now, and I have already arranged to get samples of Japanese paper. So this will make our quality very good. The government likes our printing in India. So that's why they gave me this new license. Because I said, "As we import and sell, we print more in India," so they like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the temperature here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Temperature? What's the temperature about? Twenty-nine degrees centigrade.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> It is about ninety-five. Ninety, ninety-five.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ninety-five!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How was it in Iran?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Iran night, very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was there a year ago. I've gone to Tehran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the morning also it is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You go on the morning walk now, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I heard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda can't climb up stairs. Once he goes upstairs then he'll stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about the lift here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The lift will not be ready till... Your apartment will not be ready till December or January. They can't do it any sooner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> If Śrīla Prabhupāda wants to stay somewhere else, we can find out from people where, who have got lift.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise I was thinking, we have a vacant old flat of Menon on the ground floor. I discussed it with Girirāja, and I just wanted to, I was waiting for you. If you like that, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we can convert. That is construction office. We can move the construction office somewhere else, and we can give you that whole flat on the ground floor. Girirāja and I both thought it was a good idea, but I just wanted your approval. We can do that in half a day. It is right on the ground floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That would be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but it is on the ground floor. That's the only advantage. In Vṛndāvana the guesthouse is all completely renovated. S. K. Samani came from Bombay, I showed him around Vṛndāvana, and he booked thirty rooms for ten days in September and October. Oh, it's first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mr. S. K. Samani?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> S. K. Samani, yes, Shri Krishna Samani. He liked it very much. Now the government has kept two policemen outside our Vṛndāvana temple to control the traffic, there is so much traffic. The policemen told me that we get even more people than Bankibihārī. But I don't think it's a fact, but the policemen say the crowd is bigger than Bankibihārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> Should I take it around the gate? (conversation in Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also a lot of people are coming to the Delhi temple. The Maharani of Jaipur comes every second day. She is the daughter-in-law of the Maharani Gayatridevi. Everyone, lot of, many people are coming every day to our temple in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What about Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hyderabad will be ready, I was there last week. It will be ready in time. The chief minister of Andhra Pradesh is coming as the chief guest on the day the temple will be opened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> We are getting very good bungalow in Ahmedabad. Six bedroom with six baths, all marble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we don't have any devotees there. What will we do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> There are eight devotees at least. They have to vacate in any case. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...newsstands also. Yaśomatīnandana has made some arrangement with some distributor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Newsstand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, to news, where they sell newspapers and all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> They distribute about fifteen hundred on Ratha-yātrā day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifteen hundred on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ratha-yātrā in Ahmedabad. Now we are distributing these books for one rupee each or 1.50 in Vṛndāvana because now we've got the cost of printing down to sixty paisa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Ratha-yātrā in New York was very successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I saw in the <span class="Italic">New York Times.</span> I went to the American Embassy in Delhi and I saw "East Meets West" that was the heading, and there were picture, and <span class="Italic">Daily News</span> had it on the first page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Middle page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> First page.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Center pages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three chariots, very gorgeous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's due to your causeless mercy this is spreading everywhere. There were hundreds of orders from libraries. Actually we cannot even keep up, there are so many orders coming. Every order has been dispatched, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There's not one order outstanding, but we are getting lot of correspondence, everything. And I spoke to Rāmeśvara two nights ago, he's shipping the books right away. Because we only got the sea. By Kṛṣṇa's grace, first our application for import of books was rejected. Then I went and met this very big man and preached to him. So now he's become a devotee and he said, "You just come to me. I'll give you in one day whatever you want."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So he gave the import license for five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> in one day he gave, and he also told me how to import paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> From the other side? Port number five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, doesn't matter, anywhere. He also told us how to import paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gave some hint.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I gave him some books. I meet him regularly now when I meet him. He'll come to see you in Delhi he said. He's the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports, very high position. So he has the final authority for giving licenses up to one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> He said he could give it to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the political position here? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...big celebration here starting tomorrow to the 18th. P. K. Savant, he came to see you last year, the president of Maharastra Pradesh Congress Committee, he was the chief guest. Mr. Pagay, another he is the minister from Maharastra, he's also coming. Very big program. It's being advertised all over Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So raining stopped here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Driver:</span> For three days stopped, sir. Otherwise, it was very heavy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's monsoon, it will still rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throughout whole Europe there is not a drop of water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They're getting suffering now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All, no cloud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In France I read in the paper that the river was the lowest... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">premse kaho śrī-kṛṣṇa-caitanya-prabhu-nityānanda</span> (<span class="Italic">prema-dhvani</span> etc.) Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when you have come? Everything all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hyderabad will be complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is any <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> to distribute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Is there any <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> to distribute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are taking so much trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ashnaniji's helping us a lot now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is the cause of this site. Unless he would not help, it was practically lost. I know that. Two, three hours how we finished that sales agreement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ashnaniji:</span> Customs did not open anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I see. We are always traveling, they should give us some concession. Every time we get checked. Actually, the government should have given us the best facilities because I am distributing India's culture all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unfortunately, I am not receiving encouragement from the leaders and the authorities. This is India's glory. History will say. (<span class="Italic">prasāda</span> arrives) Give it, yes, you can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pass it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All people are responding all over the world. They... Money, men, strength, everything they are supplying. But we are not getting very good encouragement from India. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission is that every Indian should become guru and preach the instruction of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Verse">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/>yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's... And people are hankering after receiving this instruction. Unfortunately, the so-called swamis, yogis, they are going... Or even politicians, they are not presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Anyway, so long I live I shall go on struggling like this. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda! All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So Nitāi, when you have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> I came just two days ago, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, everything is fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, now you can disperse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. And we have now nice buildings. Live there peacefully, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> This is my success. If I see that you are living very nicely, chanting very nicely, then all my labor is successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So if all the devotees would like to leave now, then Prabhupāda can rest a little bit from traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You can distribute <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> in the hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you are older than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Older man:</span> Your blessings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Live peacefully, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is for you, so many buildings. Let devotees come, live here peacefully, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. That I want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a lot of devotees visiting Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many you are housing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On a permanent basis about forty, but there are a few from different centers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you have received this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ṛṣabhadeva, president of Spiritual Sky Products.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> President of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Spiritual Sky in Los Angeles. He has come on a business trip. They were trying to negotiate buying incense sticks from Mysore, sandalwood, and Bangalore. So they are... Did you get those color proofs I sent you of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>? Did you like? It's coming out quite nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not as good, not as good as foreign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not as good as foreign? That is... But we are going to be printing the softbound book for seven rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, we shall talk later on. Now let me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Maybe somebody could take those flowers and put them in vases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All the pictures have a garland. Distribute it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have come, it is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Would you like to take some fruit now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll tell you. Not now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span> (offers obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Everything came in and nothing is on any passport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, you had the key. Does the dictaphone work? All right, you take the keys back, the dictaphone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just one second. If you can open it I can, or just pass it to me and I'll open it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That projector also there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Projector?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there was no projector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, that was Ātreya Ṛṣi's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, we should have many of those in India. They're so marvelous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a desk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Do you have the almirah key?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is almirah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Prabhupāda's bedroom almirah somehow got out here, or is that the almirah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which almirah? Which almirah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The sitting room it says, this one I think. Maybe it's not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I can go check on that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They weren't labeled when we were here, they were labeled a long time afterwards.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is not for this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the cash box.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This one has two keys, Hari-śauri. They say "one" and "two." This is not it. This is the key for the inside. This is not this key.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's this one. They all fell off the hoop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, do you have the key to these two almirahs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's some keys that we didn't know where they fit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, how are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the lift is... Oh! Thank you. Lift is not available.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're all here now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There was one key that dropped off the hoop. There's one, two, and the small cash box inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is the cash box key. For this box.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What are these keys? This, this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, how he can know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He had one key I think for one of these.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Keep in the bag everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, they're all in the bag there somewhere. A couple weren't labeled. This is here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Very comfortable journey?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) There was no water. All over Europe there is no cloud. No water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Big drought. They just had to close the factories in Wales because there's no water now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It's a reaction to their sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It will be increasing throughout the whole world. <span class="Italic">Anāvṛṣṭi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They think it's just happening by chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Godless civilization, sinful activities. The reaction will increase, no rainfall, scarcity of foodgrains, and government taxes. These are written in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Anāvṛṣṭi-durbhikṣa...</span> Government will exact tax more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was a scientific study done by the CIA in America, this study done by the CIA on world weather conditions. And they concluded that the world weather conditions only get worse and worse. There's going to be drought every three, four years, and so there will not be food production.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is predicted in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. They're having earthquakes in China now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, big ones. They say a million people died in the last one.</div>
