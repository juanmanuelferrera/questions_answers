<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Prabhu, you understand English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You stay with your son?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> No. I am ...(unclear).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you stay here and join your son for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness? Because your son is so good, you must be good. Because a son cannot be good unless the mother is good. Because son inherits the mother's quality. That is nature. This Hayagrīva's mother wrote me first one letter of congratulations, and she came also to see me in New Vrindaban, his father and mother. Especially his mother is very happy. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will produce good father and mother, and therefore they will have good children, and there will be no problem in the world. If everyone is Kṛṣṇa conscious. Not everyone, even ten per cent people become Kṛṣṇa conscious, there will be no problem. Problem is created due to bad children. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Varṇa-saṅkara.</span> So if there are good children, there is no problem. Even in this material world, everything will become happy. The basic principle of Vedic civilization is to create good children. All the rules and regulations, everything is there just to create good children. In the first chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> these things are described very nicely by Arjuna. There are many purificatory processes to create a good child. A human being is not meant for creating offspring like cats and dogs. They must produce very good child. That is Vedic civilization. Good child means Kṛṣṇa conscious child. That's all. Yes. So we are trying to turn these children of the Western world, good children. And people should cooperate with us, this movement. We are taking care of the children, especially young boys and girls who are coming, and we are taking care of them very nicely. Sometimes we are getting them married also, to make their life very peaceful and intelligent and spiritually advanced and make a solution of life. So people should come forward to cooperate with this movement. How many children you have got? Two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Two boys. And other one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other. He is eldest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> The other one is in Canada.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Canada? In Vancouver? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No. In Calgary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...making solution. Hayagrīva? You are biased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hayagrīva:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You suggest that "Here is another solution. Why we should take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness?" No. There is no other. You have got any suggestion, any other method? No. Then why don't you take to it and preach? What is the difficulty? You don't like? [break] ...especially Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Yes. That is the instruction of Rūpa Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti-rasa-bhāvitā-matiḥ krīyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate tatra laulyam ekalaṁ mūlyam na janma-koṭi sukṛtair labhyate.</span> Very nice verse. He instructs that "If you can purchase Kṛṣṇa consciousness from any market, any store, please immediately buy it." Then next question is "Then what is the price? What shall I have to pay for it?" And Rūpa Gosvāmī says, "Oh, the price is simply eagerness." <span class="Italic">Tatra laulyam</span>... "Yes, I must have Kṛṣṇa consciousness." That is the price. <span class="Italic">Laulyam,</span> that eagerness is not achieved even after many, many births. That is the price. Therefore it requires a little intelligence. "Oh, such a valuable thing? I can purchase only by eagerness? Why not become eager immediately?" That is intelligence. You are German or Australian or... (end)</div>
