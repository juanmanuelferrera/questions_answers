<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...feverish. But these people, they take <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> as a means of liberation. That is their mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is their mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is where we were quarreling very often.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We have now made a conclusion not to fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise he can become a Jamadagna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kirtirāja:</span> I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You know Jamadagna? You know Jamadagna?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Jamadagni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who asked Paraśurāma to fill his bowl up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say Jamadagna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Jamadagni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means Jamadagni's son. Paraśurāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Jamadagni, the Paraśurāma's son. Jamadagna is Paraśurāma, the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...being done in America because it is not to be done here. Here religion has become fanaticism and political degradation. It is not possible. Now see in our political paper how they are seriously doing and people taking seriously. Whatever program I give them, they are systematically doing. Here there is no assistance. [break] ...cry, "Oh, we are in, put in this condition, put in this..." Complain. But what is the remedy, we do not take. That is India's position. Mr. Kanunda(?), he's the son of late governor of Gujarat(?). He came to offer me a land in Bhuvaneśvara. So he said... He's the manager of the coal organization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Coal Corporation of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He's the general manager. He told me that "Workers, they are not working. Therefore we have to increase price." Now, when the, it was private concern, they were managing. They were working very nicely. Now, since it has become government concern, they are not working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Same thing in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...in nationalized banks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If you go there, you have... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is government, no responsibility. [break] <span class="Italic">...kriyā hīnā.</span> These governments are not... They are not reformed, and they have taken the post of government. Nobody can do(?). [break] ...today the political paper, Harmonist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I read the... Shall I read it now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so that others may hear. [break] ...you simply present the card anywhere-you get things. You don't require to pay. Then your bills will be paid by the bank. This is the system. [break] ...Bank of American card, in any American, bank of America, I can get one hundred to five hundred dollars immediately. I have got that card. [break] ...the respectable customers... Yes. [break] ...money, then you can squander it, and that is the idea. And you more spend money; then they manufacture consumer goods. That is the policy. [break] <span class="Italic">...ṣad</span> says, <span class="Italic">tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā: [Īśo mantra 1]</span> "Don't use anything more than what is allotted to you." That's all. But they are creating artificial demand, and the demand is being paid for by artificial paper. The government is issuing: "This is five hundred pounds or five hundred rupees," but it is paper only. Actually it is cheating. But we are satisfied. [break] ...said, "In God we trust." That's all. "In God we trust." What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have written, "In God we trust"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because I am giving you this paper-I am cheating you-therefore I am "In God we trust." [break] And the best in the world. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have given, fathers, by their forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...street you'll find, both ways, boarding: generally cigarette, wine, and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the night clubs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Naked woman, that's all. Both sides it is there. They advertise. Here... In America, anywhere you deposit forty dollars. Next day you get everything. [break] ...they say, "This year it is now reduced." Mean "Criminality, let go on, but from the last year, this year it is now reduced." That's all. [break] "...are drinking. Therefore you cannot call me drunkard." This is the logic. [break] These rogues and thieves will increase. That is the law of nature. Men... (breaks) They have a fire(?). [break] ...took down. [break] ...police, they simply only note down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In America also, like here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. My things were stolen from my apartment in the beginning, so I went to the police. They simply noted down. That's all. [break] ...you can narrate the incidents when the negro at San Francisco...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lilavati:</span> Yes, we were...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] <span class="Italic">Kṣatriya,</span> this is all finished. Now only <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and, little <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> there are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, here, here you have got also <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But they don't follow them. Nobody follows them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Many people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mr. Ford is going to be the president now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...of safety and security. During Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira's reign there was no unnecessary disease and anxiety also. That is mentioned. You have read? [break] Some hundred years ago. When I went to Kashmir, so they said that "Here the law was if a thief was caught and proved he has stolen, his hands would be cut off."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the law presently in Arabia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man:</span> Nepal too. Nepal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. [break] So at the present moment Indians means non-Mohammedans. What he is, he does not know-but he is not Mohammedan. That's all. (laughter) Otherwise he has to be, go to Pakistan. Therefore he's non-Mohammedan. That's all. [break] In big, big cities you cannot safely walk. Here, India still, we lie down in the open air. That is not possible there. In Dallas, Dallas I wanted to lie down in the open air. "No, no, you cannot do that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In that way England is better. England is far better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, England... England you cannot lie down on the open. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, but on the countryside you can pitch a tent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not possible. It is very cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, not in... I mean in summer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even in summer it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading:) "...cannot safely walk a city street or sleep without fear of burglars and the government has fallen far short of the actual standard of a legitimate administration." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are criticizing strongly in our paper. [break] ...command a position. If you manufacture government like that, it will never be capable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "But it's said in all authentic, revealed scriptures, wherein it is declared that the purpose of civilized human life is to live together in peace and harmony so that everyone can advance progressively in spiritual life." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...purpose of life. But they do not know what is the purpose of life. They have taken the idea of cats and dogs, simply sense gratification. Now, where, how there will be good government. [break] ...all leniency to the Mohammedans to get vote. That's a fact. [break] <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> anywhere, or <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> you'll never find a woman is elected on the topmost post.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And that was widow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, woman is never, was made a king. That was... Now it has become a fashion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the widow with all her virtues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...days greatest politician. <span class="Italic">Viśvāso naiva kartavyaḥ strīṣu rāja-kuleṣu ca.</span> So our present head of the state is both woman and diplomat. That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...pursuit of human culture are not possible. The government, by being weak and impotent, has thus failed to maintain the standard of civilized culture."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere. Simply rogues. They want money. That's all. They do not want anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think <span class="Italic">Rāma-rājya</span> was the real democracy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rāma-rājya</span> was not democracy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, it was a sort of democracy because it happened that his wife, on seeing ordinary menials...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why king should be under any criticism? (breaks) There is a <span class="Italic">jalebi</span> seller. He is the medium of bribing police. He has got ten lakhs of rupees, ordinary <span class="Italic">jalebi</span> seller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Yet even in places where the police get good scores for solving crime and apprehending law-breakers, the crime rate remains high."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we were children, there was a respectable gentleman, Mullick's family. He was agent of taking bribe on behalf of... [break] ...Los Angeles. The same thing I am talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you will have them, all the photos from here also. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anardhena nyāya-rahitam:</span> "If you have no money, then you'll never get justice." Dalmia, he was imprisoned for two years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was never in the jail. I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was in the Delhi Hospital. [break] I am speaking so loudly real thing. Here you cannot. Immediately you'll be in the black book. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "...must go unpunished. This is itself the business of criminal and lawless men who have no knowledge what it means to protect the citizens under their charge." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is rogues. So what is the value of that laws? The legislative assembly means a set of rogues, and if they legislate something, what is the value of that? [break] Caught like that, yes. Because people are becoming degraded, so they elected such degraded everything. [break] Shameless. The whole nation is asking that "You resign." "No." Such shameless. [break] ...that somebody was in the room, and the outsider says, "Who is in the room?" "No, no! I am not stealing!" (laughter) "No, no, I am not stealing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> There's a saying that when you throw a stone in a pack of dogs, the one who is hit will scream. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others also, followers. These ordinary, so-called <span class="Italic">Gosvāmīs</span> in Vṛndāvana, in the outwardly, in religious dress, and inwardly they are committing so many sinful activities, they will become the dogs and hogs and monkeys in Vṛndāvana. So one <span class="Italic">Gosvāmī,</span> he has taken very much objection to this writing, and he is making propaganda against me like anything. There was arrangement of reception. He stopped it. [break] That I have also written, that now, after finishing the sinful reaction, these monkeys and dogs will be liberated. That I have also written. [break] ...one has passed stool, during daytime, due to the sunshine, the upper side is dry. So if somebody says, "This side is better than the other side. The moist side is not so good. The dry side is good." [break] ...nation, you'll find (indistinct) gentlemen, but they do not know that these things are criminals. They think it is ordinary thing, illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They say it is ordinary necessities. [break] Therefore we call <span class="Italic">mūḍhās.</span> They do not know what is what.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think Abraham Lincoln was the best of the whole presidents. What is your opinion, Abraham Lincoln?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, moist stool or dry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gave the negroes freedom, Abraham Lincoln?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, emancipation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Americans say he acted with negroes just we have acted with the aboriginals, the Āryans. What have we done with the poor aboriginals of India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have... [break] "...one sect. Because we are sitting in Haridvar, and people will come here. And A.C. Bhaktivedanta, he is going." So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bhaktivedanta has formed a canal to take the spiritual India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are now envious. [break] <span class="Italic">Abaddha karuṇā sindhu, katiya mohan, abaddha karuṇā sindhu, katiya mohan...</span> That "All men, you take..." "Nityānanda has cut open the stagnant water, and now it is overflooded." Like that. <span class="Italic">Abaddha karuṇā sindhu...</span> [break] Caitanya Mahāprabhu also said,</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</div>
<div class="After-Verse">that this is business. Not that <span class="Italic">pṛthivī loka</span> will come. You have to go and preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> That is the purpose and duty (indistinct) of saints who have already realized...(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Another... That is said,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata bhūmite manuṣya janma haila yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari karo para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Paropakāra. Yes, that is India's duty. [break] ...nonsense, that sitting at, very comfortably at Haridvara. [break] ...says, everything... <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ...</span> Everything has got control of the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> How you can say it is material when it is, it can be used... There is another verse. What is called? <span class="Italic">Prapañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandha-vastunaḥ.</span> Everything has got relation with the Supreme because it is a production of the supreme energy. So everything is connected. So</div>
<div class="Verse">prāpañcikatayā buddhyā<br class="calibre2"/>hari-sambandha-vastunaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo<br class="calibre2"/>phalgu-vairāgya kathyate</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If we do not take everything in that relation, that "Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. Everything has got relationship with Kṛṣṇa," and if we simply give it up, "Oh, this is material. This is material..." [break] ...has got relation of Kṛṣṇa. Therefore everything should be dovetailed in the service of Kṛṣṇa. And that is real understanding. [break] You'll find simply drunkards lying down on the street. I lived there for some time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Nowhere in the Newsweek article is the quackery of these signs..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they were very much respectful to me. On my door they are lying down and passing urine. As soon as I will come, "Come on. Come on. Come on, sir. Come on," respectful. They were very respectful. Hm. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...grudge because I am presenting Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Personality of God. That is their grudge. That is the grudge of the all impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "This allegation, however, betrays such a profound lack of knowledge that the so-called swami sounds more like one who is learned at Hinduism at New York University than an authentic scholar of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span>" [break] "Supreme Brahman, the ultimate..."
