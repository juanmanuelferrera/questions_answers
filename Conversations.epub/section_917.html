<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chapter Sixteen, text number seventeen.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">Translation: "Self-complacent and always impudent, deluded by wealth and false prestige, they sometimes perform sacrifices in name only, without following any rules or regulations."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modern yogic society. "Transcendental Meditation." Whatever nonsense they like, they do. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated that yogis should sit down in a secluded, sacred place, and they are seeking after America's big, big cities. Hmm? They find out yogic class in America's big, big cities, hotels. This is their program. The prescription is that one should sit down in a solitary sacred place, alone, and these rascals are holding class. All smokers, drunkard, woman-hunters, (laughs) they are yogis. Hmm? What do you think? Is it all right? This is going on. And they are accepted, "Yogi this," "Yogi that." This is going on. In India they cannot find out because people are not so fool as yet that in big, big cities, in a big, big hotel, "yoga practice." India, although so fallen, they will not accept. They will at once detect, "Here is a rascal." But here, their <span class="Italic">dhana-māna,</span> their qualification... They have got money. So whatever they accept, that is all right, because they have got money. No other qualification required. They have money; they can pay. That's all. You read that, <span class="Italic">dhana-māna...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātma-sambhāvitāḥ stabdhā dhana-māna-madānvitāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What are the word meanings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "<span class="Italic">Ātma-sambhāvitāḥ</span>-self-complacent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they are thinking, it is all right, that's all. They are not going to hear any authority. Whatever they think, that is final. That's all. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "<span class="Italic">Stabdhāḥ</span>-impudent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No obedience to authority. Impudent. And?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhana-māna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhana-māna.</span> Because they have got money, whatever they think, that's all right. And their gurus also will say, "Yes, it is all right." If the guru says that "It is not all right," then nobody will come to him. He has to say "It is all right," because he's also after money and woman. That's all. He does not come here to teach something. This is going on. Therefore they come in so many numbers. They have now taken a good field. And in America you go, you say any nonsense, and they'll accept. And pay money for that. From the very beginning it is going on. Now, because it is going on like that, we are also counted amongst them. "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." This is the difficulty. They are also taking this movement, "Oh, these boys are chanting and dancing. This is also another sentiment, another edition of hippie movement." There is a, I think, Gresham's theory: "Bad money drives away good money." You know this? This is a economic theory. "Bad money drives away good money." Because nowadays bad money, that paper money, is going on, that gold coins no more in existence. Formerly we have seen gold coins in our childhood. You have not seen any. We have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Collector's items.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Collector's items.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Collector's?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only someone may have one just as a collection. You can't get them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Formerly in the currency, when you go to take some exchange, it was the etiquette of the teller to ask you, "What you want, silver money, gold money or paper money?" It was their duty. If you say "I want gold money," they will pay in gold money. Not only it is written in the paper, "I promise to pay," but the promise was kept. If he wants, "Give me payment in gold," they will pay. And now, to keep gold, hoarding gold, is illegal. So you cannot ask. This is going on, legalized cheating. You have to accept this paper money. That's all. Don't ask for gold. And there is no honesty at all. I can take paper money for my convenience sake, but how you can force me to take paper money? That is not honesty. So dishonesty begins from the government. You cannot keep gold. If you have kept gold, there will be searching, and if it is found that you have gold, you'll be punished. In India it is now being done. There is no freedom even at your home, in your private life. Formerly, any common man could keep gold according to his desire. There was no such thing. Sometimes he would hide it even within the ground, because there was no bank. At least in India this was the practice. If you have got some gold, you keep it somewhere confidential within the ground so that it may not be stolen. So everyone should have right to keep his money as he likes. Why government should interfere? Therefore you see the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, rājanya-dasyu-dharmaḥ.</span>(?) The government men will be like rogues and thieves. By law they will take away. It is now going on in India. I think here it is also? You cannot keep gold. Why I cannot keep gold? If I have secured gold, I can keep it. I want gold. You write, "I promise to pay," so there must be gold coins. I must have. So many difficulties will come in the kingdom of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> gradually. It is already come. The eight items... What are those items?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Twelfth Canto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Duration of life, mercifulness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāyeṇālpāyuṣaḥ sabhya kalāv asmin yuge janāḥ mandāḥ sumanda-matayo... [SB </span>1.1.10].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Symptoms of the age of Kali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Duration of life is decreased. If one is twenty years old, he will be a grand old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bodily strength decreases. Then <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Memory is decreasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dayā, dharma,</span> religious principles-everything will be reduced. And the government men, instead of giving you protection, they will act like thieves and rogues. You cannot say anything. Very, very precarious condition, all freedom lost. In Russia, all freedom lost. They have no freedom. The professor giving that testimonial, and "Don't publish it." They are appreciating this book, but they cannot say "That is good book." Just see what kind of freedom is there. A nice book, I appreciate; I cannot give in writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The American government would say, "How can you say that there's no freedom when the First Amendment of the United States Constitution says that there is freedom of religion? One can make any religion he likes and follow."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they can amend. By simply by writing by the government men, that's all, it becomes a law. There is no question of its validity, but because it is spoken by government, therefore the... In other words, the government men should be so honest and so elevated that actually their words should be law. But this is democracy. Any nonsense can take vote and go to the government, and then whatever he will say, that will be law. Who cares that he's a rascal? Somehow or other he has gotten vote and he's in a position. Who is considering that? And in the Vedic age only the first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and sages, they would... <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> That is law, not that any rascal goes into the legislative assembly and passes some law. Of course, whatever government says, that is law, but what is the position of the government now? And similarly everything. A yogi is actually worshipable. But what are these yogis, rascals? So these are asuric. And it is said... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhana-māna-madānvitāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhana</span> means money. So if you have got money, then everyone will respect you. Personally you may be less than a dog, but because you have got money, people will respect you. Is it not? (laughs) In England I was guest in John Lennon's house. He has taken a photograph, naked. And he's a big man. He gives opinion to the newspaper reporter. People go there to take his opinion about some serious subject, and he speaks, and the man is so shameless that he is standing naked, and he's important man-because he has got money. Especially in the Western countries this is very prominent. If you have got money, then you have got everything. Therefore they are after money only, that "If some way or other, if I get money, then I get everything. I get respect, I get honor. I get everything. Bring money somehow or other." This is the attempt. Therefore there is so much hard struggle. From early in the morning, four o'clock, they are going to the office to get money. To get more money, more money, that is the Western civilization. Now in India they have also learned. And our philosophy is "Don't try to get money." <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayeteta.</span> "You should simply engage your life for advancing your Kṛṣṇa consciousness." So who will hear us? We say, "There is no need of working so hard for money." <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujāṁ ye [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This kind of working hard is done by the hogs and dogs, so why a human being should work so hard simply to get the necessities of life? [break] ...and dogs, they are getting necessities of life in that way. [break] This association, this meeting, this talking, is meant for the human body; it is not for the cats and dogs. This is human civilization. Naimiṣāraṇya meeting going on, all the big, big learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> sages, they are talking how to do welfare activities to the human society. What is this civilization? Simply money, money, money, money, money. And as soon as you get money, then you begin all nonsense, illicit sex, meat-eating, drinking, gambling. What you will do with the money? You do not know how to spend it. Hm. <span class="Italic">Dhana-māna-madānvitāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Purport, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Thinking themselves all in all, not caring for any authority or scripture, the demoniac sometimes perform so-called religious or sacrificial rites. And since they do not believe in authority, they are very impudent. This is due to illusion caused by accumulating some wealth and false prestige. Sometimes such demons take up the role of preacher, mislead the people, and become known as religious reformers or as incarnations of God. They make a show of performing sacrifices and they worship the demigods, or manufacture their own God. Common men advertise them as God and worship them, and by the foolish they are considered advanced in the principles of religion, or in the principles of spiritual knowledge. They take the dress of the renounced order of life and engage in all nonsense in that dress. Actually there are so many restrictions for one who has renounced this world. The demons, however, do not care for such restrictions. They think that whatever path one can create is one's own path; there is no such thing as a standard path one has to follow. The word <span class="Italic">avidhi-pūrvakam,</span> meaning 'disregard for the rules and regulations,' is especially stressed here. These things are always due to ignorance and illusion." Next verse? Text 18.</div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṅkāraṁ balaṁ darpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kāmaṁ krodhaṁ ca saṁśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mām ātma-para-deheṣu<br class="calibre2"/>pradviṣanto 'bhyasūyakāḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Translation: "Bewildered by false ego, strength, pride, lust and anger, the demon becomes envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is situated in his own body and in the bodies of others, and blasphemes against the real religion." Purport? "A demoniac person, being always against God's supremacy, does not like to believe in the scriptures. He is envious of both the scriptures and of the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is caused by his so-called prestige and his accumulation of wealth and strength. He does not know that the present life is a preparation for the next life. Not knowing this, he is actually envious of his own self, as well as of others. He commits violence on others' bodies and on his own. He does not care for the supreme control of the Personality of Godhead because he has no knowledge. Being envious of the scriptures and the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he puts forward false arguments against the existence of God and refutes the scriptural authority. He thinks himself independent and powerful in every action. He thinks that since no one can equal him in strength, power or in wealth, he can act in any way and no one can stop him. If he has an enemy who might check the advancement of his sensual activities, he makes plans to cut him down by his own power." Śrīla Prabhupāda, in this purport you mention that not knowing that this life is a preparation for the next life, that one actually becomes envious of his own self.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If he's going to become a dog next life and if he does not take precaution, then he is not envying himself? In this life you are prime minister, and next life, you are preparing to become a dog, so what is the use of becoming prime minister? You could not save yourself. Nature's law will go on. You may become prime minister or any minister, but the law will act. If you have infected some disease, so the disease will develop. It doesn't matter whether you are prime minister or this minister. So these rascals say they do not know it. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu.</span> Find out this verse. This low-grade birth, high-grade birth, why it is happening? <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">"The living entity in material nature thus follows the ways of life, enjoying the three modes of nature. This is due to his association with that material nature. Thus he meets with good and evil amongst various species."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are practically seeing it, that material nature... Some infection, this is also material nature, and if you are infected with some contaminous disease, you must suffer. They practically see it. The nature will work. <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-sthaḥ.</span> As soon as we are in this material world... I am living entity, spirit soul, and because I am in this material world, I have accepted this material body under the regulation of the material laws. Otherwise why there are so many varieties of life? Here is a tree. It is standing here. We are human beings; we are also here. But when there is cold blast, scorching heat, we can go into the room, but he has to be standing here for thousands of years. Why this distinction? It cannot move even an inch. It is also living entity. Why he is punished in that way? And when there will be snowfall, pinching cold, he cannot go. But a small ant, it can go from here to there. Moving and not moving, the two kinds of living entities... Some of them can move; some of them cannot move, <span class="Italic">sthāvara.</span> Just like grass. We are trampling over with our legs. It cannot protest. Why these differences of grades of life? This is described here. <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte</span> [Bg. 13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Enjoys. <span class="Italic">Bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Because this <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> nature, is made of three modes of material nature, <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa, rajo-guṇa, tamo-guṇa.</span> Just like we are trying to associate with <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa</span>-no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling. So others, they are not anxious for these thing. They will say, "What is the wrong there? You can do that." But because you are infecting that <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> you'll have to suffer. You'll have to become a tree; you have to become a dog. How you can stop it? Where is your science? Why the scientists dying? Why they cannot invent some means, a tablet, that "At the time of my death, push this tablet in my belly. I'll not die"? Why they are unable to do so? Who can answer this? Why the rascal scientists do not manufacture such things that there'll be no death for the scientists? Hm? What do you say? Anyone for scientists can plead? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They want to do it, Prabhupāda, but they cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is complacence. What is called? "Yes, in future we shall do." That's all. Then at present you cannot do. Then you are imperfect. Why you are declaring yourself as scientist? Scientist means who is in full knowledge. That is scientist. And if you are not in full knowledge, how you are scientist? "Big, big scientist, big, big belly, Ceylon jumping, melancholy." Rascals say that chemical, combination of chemical, makes life. So we challenge that you begin from an egg. Everyone sees the egg-some white substance, some yellow substance, covered with some shells. So just manufacture it and give it to the incubator, and let the chicken come. Why you take the egg from another living chicken? What is the answer? You rascal, you make one small egg. We can see there are some white substance, yellow substance, so you combine some chemicals, white and yellow, and cover it with celluloid shell and put it under the incubator. You get. Why the rascals cannot do it? And still, the rascals will say that life can be..., is combination of chemicals. Give this challenge to these rascals, that "Life is... If it is combination of chemicals, why don't you do it, the simple thing?" Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janāhlāda:</span> I was reading the other day where they have certain kinds of scientists who do nothing but make tastes out of chemicals. They say they can duplicate any taste, and they are very highly paid now for making synthetic foods taste like all other kinds of real foods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they'll not produce food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janāhlāda:</span> They are not producing the food, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way they are getting high salary, and we have to pay tax for that, income tax. This is going on. That means roguism. We have got money. Government will take it away and pay these rascals, scientific research. There are so many foundations in your country. If you ask them, "Give us some money for Kṛṣṇa conscious," "No, no, no, we don't pay for anything. We pay to the scientists." They will say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Now they are going to Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Now they are going to Mars planet. They have two ships heading for Mars, and they want one to land on July 4th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has already started?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes. Now they have given up on the moon. Now it is Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the fools are paying for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, millions of dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. One attempt has already failed; again they are making attempt and spending like any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Isn't it impossible for them to reach Mars because it is a hellish planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says it is hellish planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> It is described as inauspicious in Third Canto in the story of Varāha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. So first of all let them go. They cannot go. According to our calculation, Vedic calculation, the moon is above sun planet, and the Mars is above moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Oh. Then they would have to go past the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Then they would have to go past the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, according to their calculation, 93,000,000's miles... So the moon is above 1,600,000 miles. And again 1,600,000. So another three million miles above the sun, it becomes sixteen million miles. So if they cannot go to the sun planet, how they can go to the Mars? All bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ṛṣi Kumāra:</span> I saw one scientist on television, and he was saying on Mars there are mountains that are very, very big, much bigger than the mountains on this planet, and there's beautiful landscape, and they want to start a tourist industry, taking people back and forth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They want to start a tourist industry on Mars, taking people back and forth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They already sold the tickets to the moon. Now they're going to go on to Mars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say there is less advanced life, like plants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not more advanced life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> According to their speculation, they say that the atmosphere is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Well they have a system, so-called system, by using light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we find there are two kinds of living entities, <span class="Italic">sthāvara</span> and <span class="Italic">jaṅgama.</span> One kind of living entity, they cannot move, and one kind of living entity, they move. So just like here there is grass, there are trees and there are... We are also. There are many animals who can move. So why, if there are plants who are not moving, why not the other moving animals? This is commonsense reason. Everywhere we see two kinds of animals, moving and not moving. If the not-moving is there, why not the moving? What is the wrong there? This is our first question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say that under certain conditions, just like in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, don't, don't find such conditions. That is a rascaldom. We don't find such con... Anywhere you go, there are two kinds of living entities, moving and not moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janāhlāda:</span> One of the ways they tell whether there are advanced forms of life is if they can see vegetation growing on different planets in waves like the seasons, and if they can't see that in an orderly pattern, then they conclude that there is no life, no advanced life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is no vegetation? They say there is vegetation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say, lichens. Lichens are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means not yet certain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> No, they admit they're not certain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is all... They're misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> According to that report we read the other day, they had good information now that the atmosphere was water and ice, like that. So they were expecting to find some signs of life, and they were going to land a spaceship in a canyon which was just below the equator, just at the mouth of the canyon. And it's four miles deep, and fifty thousand years ago it was filled with water, so they are expecting to find fossils there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They've never been there, though. Speculation.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are speculating. But why people are victimized by this speculation? That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the amazing thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have already failed in one speculation. They went to moon planet with some speculation. That has failed. Why they are given chance, another speculation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Everyone believes that they went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Everyone believes that they went.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They went, but what is the benefit? What for they went?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> For scientific exploration. They consider that very noble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientific exploration at the expense of these taxpayer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They consider it a very noble cause to increase knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... The same story, that some frogs were there, and children was throwing stone. Then the frogs appealed, "Sir, why you are throwing stone upon us?" "No, we are playing." "So what is play for you, it is death to us." So these rascals are playing, and we have to pay heavy tax for that. This is going on. We are playing, making some scientific research, and who will pay for that? You. You work hard in the factory and pay tax. This is civilization. "You pay tax, and we spend it as we like." Frivolity(?). This is going on. This is the government of Kali-yuga. What can you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> "In God We Trust."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "What is play to you is death to us." And "Never mind. You die. We play." They have already spent so much money, moon exploration. And that has stopped now, no benefit. They brought some sand and some rock, satisfied. Again the same thing with Mars. But we can say from our poor knowledge that as they have failed in the moon planet, they will fail also in the Mars. Take it down. Note now. Do you know this is all bluff?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In Los Angeles papers they quoted you saying that, that they didn't go to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They quoted you as saying this in Los Angeles, in a newspaper. Also your Monday-Tuesday example, Sunday-Monday. They put that in the newspaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can answer that. The common sense. Can any one of you answer why Sunday first and Monday next? You are one of the scientists. Why don't you say? It is commonsense question, "Why Sunday first and next...?" All over the world. In the human society, everywhere you go, they will say Sunday first, Monday second. In India <span class="Italic">Ravivāra. Ravi. Ravi</span> means sun. And <span class="Italic">Somavāra. Somavāra</span> means Monday. The planetary system is so arranged, first of all sun, then moon. Then Mars, then Saturn, Saturday. Saturn is last. Even Svarūpa Dāmodara has not answered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He cannot meet the challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any scientist here who can answer why Sunday first and Monday second?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Janāhlāda:</span> I'm not a scientist, but I always thought that the ancients thought that the sun was first because without telescopes or without light-measuring instruments it was bigger and it looked closer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. Sunday is first, and Monday-moon is beyond sun. If they accept that nobody can approach sun, then how they can approach moon? In calculation, eighteen thousand miles per hour, and if the moon is situated 95,000,000 miles, then how they can go in four days? These are my questions. They have not been answered. It takes at least seven months. And they went in four days, and the man's mother... His photograph was there. She said, "At last my son has gone there." You have seen that photograph? I have seen it. Mother was satisfied. This is going on.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say, due to evolution over many millions of years...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say "Somehow or other..." Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that science? "Somehow or other." If I say, "Somehow or other, you'll become a dog," (laughter) what is the wrong there? If things are taking place somehow or other, so I say somehow or other you'll become a dog. Our explanation is complete. They accept somehow or other is a means. So somehow or other, you are going to be dog. How can you deny it? If that is your position, that things are taking place somehow or other, so how can you deny, somehow or other you'll become a dog? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They will say that "We have seen that these other things have taken place..."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many varieties of life, so we have to accept one of them by Kṛṣṇa's desire, Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> He is situated in everyone's heart. He's observing everything. So He orders that "Give him a body like this." Who can check it? <span class="Italic">Bhrāmayan sarva-bhūtāni yantrārūḍhāni māyayā [Bg. </span>18.61<span class="Italic">].</span> This body is a machine. The machine is given by material nature. Today you may be a very big man, and by your activities, asuric activities, you are so condemned that you have to accept a lower-grade life, a fox, sly fox. "You are very sly to spend others' money in moon excursion. Now you become a fox." So who can check it? Here it is stated, <span class="Italic">tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you cannot check it. You are not so great scientist. Then how do you say, "There is no God"? You cannot check God's law, so how you can say that there is no God? You can say at your home, "I don't care for government." And when government arrests you and puts you in difficulty, how can you check it? Is it possible? Then why do you submit that? When the police comes and arrests you, you can say, "No, no, I don't care for any officer." You cannot say. Is this not punishment? This tree is standing here for hundreds of years, and it will go on standing for thousands of years. Is it not punishment? So what the atheist will answer, this? Kṛṣṇa says, "I'll put him into this condition." What the atheist will answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> He'll say there is no experience of anyone taking a next birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No experience? You are not diseased? Do you want disease? Still, you say you have no experience? When you are put into some disease and go to hospital and the doctor surgically operates your body, so you have no experience? You did not want that. Your fertile brain, when it is operated with hammer, so you did not experience? How do you say that you have no experience? You are suffering every moment. But you don't want suffering. How do you say that there is no experience? That is foolishness. They are suffering every moment, <span class="Italic">adhyātmika, adhibhautika, adhidaivika.</span> Still, you say you have no experience? Means shameless. In Indian language we call <span class="Italic">vehāyā</span>. He has got repeated experience; still, he'll say, "No, I don't care for it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> How does he have experience of rebirth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apart from that... That you have to take. Because you are put into difficulty which you do not want, this is your experience. So the intelligent man's question will be that "I did not want this, but who has put me into this condition?" That is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they say that the suffering, there's no divine cause for that. That's just a material cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, you did not want; you have it-against your will. This is your experience. There is no difference. Either you say material cause or spiritual cause, but you are suffering what you did not want. That is the point. You are suffering. And you did not want it. <span class="Italic">Yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ.</span> Nobody wants distress, but it comes. How it comes? <span class="Italic">Yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ,</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja... <span class="Italic">Ayatnataḥ</span> means without any endeavoring. Who is trying that "Let there be fire in my house"? But it takes. Nobody wants that "There may be fire in my house," but there is fire. Therefore you have to arrange for fire brigade. You are expecting always some danger. Therefore you make so many precautions, because you know that although you do not want mishappening, it will come. Nobody endeavors for mishappenings, but you know there is some superior force who'll enforce mishappening. And they are unable to counteract. Just like a scientist knows that he'll die, but he's so expert scientist that he cannot counteract. He knows that he'll die. He's talking all nonsense while living, but he does not make any arrangement that he'll not die. That he is unable. They are making arrangement, going to the Mars planet at the expense of taxpayer, so if we request these rascal scientists that "You discover something so that we will not die. Take any amount of money," will they able?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They'll die while they are trying to find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is the use of this scientist? That "Take any amount. Here is my beloved son. My scientist, physician, you take any amount. Just give life to my son." Is it able? These are practical. False, bogus bluffing-that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They get angry if we tell them that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is, means they are rascal. When there is argument between you and me, if one becomes angry, that means he's a rascal. That is the proof. He cannot reply anymore. He has become angry. That is his defeat. <span class="Italic">Upadeśo hi mūrkhāṇāṁ prakopāya na śāntaye. Mūrkha,</span> a rascal is given good instruction, he'll be angry. So that is the proof that he's rascal. That is the proof. The example is given, <span class="Italic">payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.</span> Just like if you give milk, very nourishing food, to a human being, he'll get strength, but if you give to a snake, it will increase poison. So that is the proof that here is a snake. So <span class="Italic">payaḥ-pānaṁ bhujaṅgānāṁ kevalaṁ viṣa-vardhanam.</span> If you give milk to a human child he'll grow healthy, and the same milk you give to a serpent child, it will grow poison. One day he'll: <span class="Italic">"Ohnn!"</span> He'll ready to bite you. You have given milk, it has increased poison, and it will show his fangs, hood. That is <span class="Italic">asura.</span> So therefore they become snakes, scorpion, so low-grade life. Snake life is so degraded that at once you see a snake, immediately every one of us will be ready to kill it. Everyone, without any mercy. Nobody will say, "No, no, let this go." So he is put into that life that he cannot come in the light. As soon as he comes in the vision of somebody, everyone is ready to kill. And nobody is sorry. Nobody is sorry. Prahlāda Mahārāja said that. <span class="Italic">Modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 7.9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even one is saintly person, he'll be satisfied if a snake is killed. Saintly person doesn't want that anyone should be killed, but if a snake is killed, he's happy: "Oh, you have done right." <span class="Italic">Modeta sādhur api vṛścika-sarpa-hatyā.</span> So Prahlāda Mahārāja said that "My father is killed; nobody is unhappy. (laughter) Nobody is unhappy. But he was just like a snake and scorpion. Now You be satisfied. There is no cause of becoming angry. Everyone is satisfied." That was Prahlāda Mahārāja's prayer.
