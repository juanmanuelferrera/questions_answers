<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I saw that one, that Mr. Maiman (?), he has got so many boxes all down his room. So I asked, "What are these?" "No, these are different cinema house collection. The ticket, half of the ticket, is put into this box before entering. So I count this slip. Then I can understand what is the income. That's all. Let them do whatever that." So I am simply asking, "How many books they are selling?" (laughter) If the sale is going on, "All right, that's all right. Let them do whatever they like." The books are printed and distributed? That is all right. Then other things, you do whatever you like. Never ask. Where is Arundhati?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Probably still upstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask her to make that bitter melon separately in little quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just fried or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, boil and then fried. Make it soft. So any letter? All right. [break] Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Antardhyāna:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is going to die. Who is going to live? Who is here? Can you show me anyone who is going to live? Can you show me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Antardhyāna:</span> No, everybody's going to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So today or tomorrow, everyone will die. So where is the anxiety? Die or not die, tomorrow or today, but one should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, that's all. Why one should be depressed? And everyone is going to die. I am going to die tomorrow, he is going to die day after tomorrow, he... Everyone will have to die. Who will live here? So what is the anxiety? Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, she'll die here. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody will live. Don't be anxiety. That's all. Anyone who has come to this material world will die. One is going to die today; another is going to die tomorrow. It is a question of first and second, but everyone will die. So before death one should be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is success of life. The tree is standing for thousands of years. So what is the use of living like that? A tree cannot chant Hare Kṛṣṇa but lives for thousands of years. Do you think that kind of living is very worthy, standing in one place, cannot move even, and what to speak of chanting? So you have got the chance to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Utilize that. Don't be anxious that "I am going to die." Who is going to live? Why don't you understand that? Nobody is going to live. So before death one should be complete in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> (Antardhyāna's daughter, terminally ill) But if one is not, Śrīla Prabhupāda, what will happen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If one is not complete in their Kṛṣṇa consciousness then what will happen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She will get again birth in a human body. That is guaranteed so that he'll get again chance of chanting. That is also great gain. Ordinary person, he does not know what body he is going to get next body. But a person who is in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, chanting, he is guaranteed. <span class="Italic">Śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is guaranteed to take birth as human being in a very sacred family like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and very rich family. So I have to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Nobody is going to live here. Everyone is going to die. Before death, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> Thank you. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't be worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Antardhyāna:</span> She is worried Prabhupāda, about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the worry? I have already said everyone is going to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Antardhyāna:</span> She is worried about seeing the Yamadūtas. This is what she is worried about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, always think of Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our business. The cats and dogs cannot do this. That is the advantage of human form of body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Antardhyāna:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Manīṣā:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
