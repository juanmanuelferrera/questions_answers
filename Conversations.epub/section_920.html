<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we've been doing with the dead cows is burying them, there's no..., everything's wasted. Śrīla Prabhupāda is proposing that why not the butcher take, we give free, he simply returns us the skin of the cow, and with the cow hide we properly tan it, we can make <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> heads for the <span class="Italic">khol,</span> and shoes, straps, whatever may be needed. The idea being that in the Western countries especially, people are accustomed to eating animals, animal flesh. So we have no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beef, especially beef.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Especially cows and beef. So we have no objection, but they should at least wait until it dies naturally. What is the harm? They still get the same thing, and one devotee, Kīrtanānanda, I think, was saying that when they slaughter an animal even in the slaughterhouse, it has to sit some time, some number of days before they distribute it. So I proposed that the Westerners, they consider that this is superstitious, this protection of the cow. Prabhupāda says Why superstitious? The cow is providing milk. Every child knows that he's getting milk from the cow, the cow is mother. So why in the old age we should slaughter mother? Is this a good argument that like, for example, they say, in India, how so many people are starving, why don't they eat the cows? So Prabhupāda proposed that "If you're starving, does it mean that you eat your mother and father?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to eat, let the father and mother die, then eat. (laughter) Who has objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's so reasonable. At least, Prabhupāda says, for the saner section, they will accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is, people are mad after meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Madman...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they still get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he'll get meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But then their argument is that if we don't have big, big slaughterhouses, then there won't be enough supply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No why should...? After all, the animal is going to die. It is not for..., he's permanently. Why should you kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they kill the animal first in the slaughterhouse and then do whatever they have to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> But we are killing when they are young, when their meat is fresh. When the body is old, the meat is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to change. Fresh or dead, you're eating flesh, that's all. You wait till the death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> But the old flesh is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you do not..., you do whatever you like. So at least you can take free of charges a dead cow from us, and you can give us only the skin, and you eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> This should be the system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's so reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We don't want anything from you; you take it, the whole flesh. You take free. You simply give us the skin, we can utilize it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even if people would do this, it would be such an advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Because a class of men will demand to eat the flesh. You cannot stop it. So we are giving free: you eat. And from economic point of view, we require the skin for our <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> making. So give us the skin. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda says the butcher, even, he can sell the meat cheaply, make profit. He's getting it free of charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Maybe some time in the future this could happen when Kṛṣṇa consciousness becomes very powerful influence in the country, but unless we could actually close the slaughterhouse...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but now by imploring, we are requesting him that "You can take this cow and sell in your shop, butcher shop, you give us the skin. And you can tell the customer that it is as good, it is cheaper. So whatever money you get, that is your profit. You haven't got to invest anything."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Do you propose that we should do this now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, no, this is... Think over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, the proposition is very good, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you try one butcher, that "Why not make this advantage?" How does he react, see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes, that he will not pay anything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's not going to pay us. You simply take it and sell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They sell meat..., for one pound of meat, they can get sometimes two dollars, three dollars, four dollars. So much money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> But the government has inspectors, a team of inspectors. No meat can be sold unless it is inspected, and then they want to examine the conditions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let them inspect. What is the wrong there? It should be open. If the inspection, there is nothing wrong, then they can do this business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Generally, though, their inspection is when the animal is alive, they check to see that he has no disease. Then they can be killed. But if an animal dies naturally, then generally it is to be supposed that it dies from some malfunction within the body, that there may be some diseases or whatever. So then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But that is their rules and regulations they have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll change. When they, by chemical analysis, they don't find any fault, then they can change. From economic point of view, why this body should be wasted? Let it be utilized. Those that are eating, let them eat. And economic point of view, we save the skin. We require it for our purpose. That is the agreement. After all, we require the skin for our <span class="Italic">khol</span> making.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> For the farm straps?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Shoes, slippers, so many things. I think Kīrtanānanda Swami has done that with some of the cows. They have taken the hide for making things, straps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're not doing it now, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we should not do it ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes, that's for the <span class="Italic">mucis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Give it to the butcher. He will get the skin and give it to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not that everything we have to do. No. That will deteriorate. Those who are doing, let it be done by them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It seems like it will be a long time before we can implement something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am proposing, think over it. Because it is a fact that in spite our vigorous propaganda, we cannot stop meat-eating. That is not possible. People will eat. So those who are eating, let us make some arrangement that "You take it free of charges." From economic point of view, they get it free. They can make good profit. And we are interested with the skin. So why not make some arrangement? It is practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Instead of the thing being wasted for nothing, let us devise some means, that you are eating, you can eat. And we want the skin, let us give him. What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Perfect economics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We require the skin, that's a fact. And you want to eat, all right, eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Could such a thing be done today in India also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why it will be done? Everywhere it should be. That is the... Who does not eat meat? First of all, you try this. From economic point of view, why one thing should be wasted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Practical preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can't stop meat-eating, but we can stop the unnecessary slaughter of animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would be a great step forward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our business is to stop slaughter. Meat-eating we cannot stop. Certain persons, they must eat. They are fourth-class, and then fifth-class men. There are four classifications-<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra</span> and <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla. Caṇḍālas,</span> they will remain, and they are eating. Let them eat meat. That is the system in India still. It is not that in India nobody's eating meat. The cobbler class, they eat; the <span class="Italic">caṇḍāla</span> class, they eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even cows, cow flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dead. This cow killing has been introduced by these Britishers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even they're exporting beef from India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They can do anything, take the dead cows. I do not know if there is any chemical composition change. They are eating so many dead animals. Take for fish. The fish is never killed alive, because as soon as you take it out from water, it is dead, after few minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And they don't consider whether it's a young fish or an old fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> If that was the system, people will not get sick. They will not get sick from eating old animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is all wrong conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They will say..., simply think the taste there is too tough, the skin may be older.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are eating so many rotten things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes. And they are burning it, cooking it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lobster, it is simply pus. They eat. I've seen it. From whiteness it has become yellow. Puslike. They eat it, what is called that soup? Lobster soup?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Clam chowder? So many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they like very much that lobster soup. In the plane, one Englishman was doing "What is this? I asked after lobster soup."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In England? Oysters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, lobsters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> With the big pinchers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They get the lobsters sometimes alive, and they throw them in boiling water, and they can hear them screaming. But now they're speculating whether it's actually the lobsters screaming because it's being boiled alive or whether it's just air that's coming out from its body and making a squeaking noise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is, apart from that, they import lobster from India, Cochin. They are exporting lobster alive. I have seen. The same ship, they load it with lobster fat, and black creepers, and cashews, they exported. The big, big business firms are exporting. So these lobster, although they are kept in ice and so on, so on, they become decomposed. I've seen in the port, that Commonwealth Pier. There is store of lobster, and the lobster has become yellow and almost melted by decomposing. They are selling that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When it starts to fall apart, that's when they consider it's the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When it starts to fall apart, that's when they think it's the best. I think I mentioned before, in England, the gentry, the British gentry, when they used to go hunting, shooting pheasants and partridges, afterwards they would get the dead birds and hang them in a shed outside, and then after some days, when all the skin and feathers were literally falling off, that's when they would eat it. That's when it was considered rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are so many <span class="Italic">kadarya</span> things. In Burma, they have got a system, Burmese family. In the door, there is a pot, a big pot. So whatever animal dies, put it in there and cover it. So in this way, after some years, they're decomposed, and it becomes liquid, and then it is so decomposed that if you open it, within three miles they smell. So that is mature. Then they take out the liquid and keep it in bottles. That is called <span class="Italic">naphi.</span> And they stock it, and when there is some feast at home they'll give little that <span class="Italic">naphi,</span> and they'll relish it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Barbers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Burma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the most...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when you fry <span class="Italic">luci,</span> all the other tenants will come "What you are cooking?" This is practical because we opened..., my Guru Mahārāja opened a branch in Burma in an apartment. So that Gaurāṅga who was my servant in family life, he was there. He said like this, that "When I fry <span class="Italic">puri,</span> the <span class="Italic">ghee</span> smell is there, so many people will come from other apartments, (whispers) "Oh, what you are cooking? What you are cooking?" And the <span class="Italic">naphi,</span> they relish it in feast. So it is a question of taste.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the ultimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> I remember as a child in Hong Kong, in the village they would keep big glass jars of snakes, they would put the snakes in jars. And after they were many times soaking in liquid, then they would eat it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pickled snakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Snakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes, keep it in a jar in liquid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They put in the jar alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> No, they catch it, kill it, put it in the jar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's like a pickle, they pickle it. And when they want to eat it, they take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is poison in the mouth, they cut it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> They cut off the head, flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Snake they eat. Even in India there is a class, they eat snake. Chinese, they eat. They are Chinese?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They eat anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So many abominable things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Someone was telling me in Mexico they have a sandwich called tortilla. It has live cockroaches. And as they're eating, the cockroaches are running to get out of the sandwich, and they are pushing them back in and eating it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Africa also they eat live bugs. Cockroaches, dead or alive, anything. Once when we were in Zambia, there was this one African who was cleaning around the house, his name was David. He was about twenty years old. So we swept up his room because it was so filthy-I was there at the time. And there were all these cockroaches in a pile, and we were about to throw them out and he said, "What, you're throwing them out? You mean you're not going to eat them?" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> There was one big, big professor we met in the college...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's hard to understand that <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is (indistinct). (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Not only the Africans, but this big, big professor, she is advocating that people should eat the bugs because they are good protein. She is experimenting different bugs to eat-the worm, the cockroach, the beetle-and she's making a big study, being paid money, how to feed people by eating insects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're already doing that. In France, you can buy cans of chocolate-coated ants, grasshoppers, frog's legs, bumblebees, fried bumblebees you can get. The French eat the most abominable foodstuff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The English think that way, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They all do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The English think the French eat abominable foods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> This is the modes of nature, Śrīla Prabhupāda, acting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kadarya bhakṣaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's difficult to imagine what kind of fate we would have had if you hadn't come and started this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everything is so scientific. We've seen practically that as people take up this chanting, that gradually they lose their taste for every other kind of eating. It's a fact. I should inform Kīrtanānanda Swami about some of these ideas?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if you can arrange with the butcher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> One thing, the other day they were saying that sometimes when they have this skim milk, and there's some excess after they've fed it to the cows, they throw it away, they use it for fertilizer. Should they do that? Is that all right to use that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, no. We can use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The skim milk, after they've...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have some skim milk. So when they've finished giving it to the devotees and they've finished giving it to the cows, then if there's any extra, they throw it away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How give it to the cows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They feed it to the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They drink it. They put it in their feed, whatever. But then if there's any extra, they throw it away, they put on the..., mix it with fertilizer or whatever for the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It should not be given to the cows. It should be kept, and when it is broken, you get the <span class="Italic">chānā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It should be made into curd and yogurt, things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not yogurt, <span class="Italic">chānā,</span> what you call, curd?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cheese, like cheese.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheese, yes? But it should not be thrown. From cheese you can make so many preparations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I'll mention it to Kulādri then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned also about the whey that you get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything should be utilized. Instead of drinking water, you can drink whey. It is very good for digesting. Whey, put little salt and black pepper, it is good digestant. You can avoid water, drink whey. You can use it for <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Making dough?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cāpāṭi,</span> just like you dip the <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi, dāl,</span> you can dip whey. You can save <span class="Italic">dāl</span> preparing expenditure. Nothing of milk product can be wasted. You should learn it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. That's what I thought, that's why I was asking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Up to the last drop, it can be utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Skim milk should not be given to the calves? The calves should get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They don't require it. They don't require it. The cow is especially meant for the human beings. They can utilize in so many ways, and they should give protection, such an important animal. This is human being. (end)</div>
