<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vṛndāvana morning walk, Vṛndāvana, April 2, 1976. Śrīla Prabhupāda is walking in the Vṛndāvana Municipal Park this morning. He drove here by car in his Mercedes. Now he's taking walk here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, car is locked, and the driver of the other car is watching it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...small park, they cannot maintain it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> ...reading in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> the cleansing of the Guṇḍicā temple. And towards the end, one Bengali Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> washed the feet of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and He became a little angry, outwardly angry, and unhappy within. And in one purport you mention that the spiritual master should not be offered obeisances or have his feet washed before the Deity. But the impression of most of the devotees has been that in the presence of the spiritual master one can stop worshiping the Deity and offer obeisances to the spiritual master. So I was wondering which is correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Dilemma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean, it's obvious if it was detrimental to our devotional service, then Prabhupāda would correct it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot also keep clean even Central Park. Then what to speak of Vṛndāvana? Things are becoming very, very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here in Vṛndāvana the people also pay taxes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, without tax.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> ...in the day sometimes, and now they are giving <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> to the devotees free, without charge. [break] ...stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They stay at the Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> Those are the originals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> [break] ...the devotees are asking one question. They're wanting to know how it was that even though there is so much distance between, let's say, Govardhana and Rādhā-kuṇḍa and Vṛndāvana, Nanda-grāma, Varṣāṇā, how it was that still Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā could go and meet, and the cowherd boys could go and meet at these various places. They could go such great distances.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is distance for you, not for them. Just like a small ant. It goes from here to here. It is a great, three hundred miles, but for you, one step. Why do you study Kṛṣṇa like you? Why do you think that Kṛṣṇa was like you? <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa can do anything, so His associates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Upadeśāmṛta,</span> in the translation you refer to this, the <span class="Italic">līlā-aṣṭa...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṣṭakāla-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> <span class="Italic">Aṣṭakāla-līlā.</span> What is that exactly? Eightfold <span class="Italic">līlā</span> or some...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eightfold, but..., eight <span class="Italic">grahas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? So the timings are.... At new Govinda temple the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New Govinda temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> New Govinda and old Govinda, both. Starting at 7:30 is the <span class="Italic">dhūpa-ārati,</span> and then, nine o'clock, is another <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> then the <span class="Italic">rāja-bhoga ārati</span> is at 11:30. Gopīnātha's temple is staggered, a little after 7:30, and the Rādhā-ramaṇa temple is 8:30. So they stagger like that. So the next <span class="Italic">ārati </span>will be 7:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in the morning, before...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Five o'clock. They start at five. The <span class="Italic">maṅgala-āratis</span> start at five. (end)</div>
