<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must neglect because foolish, they cannot solve. They're rascal. They cannot solve. They're simply pleased with some what is called, temporary success. That's all. The ultimate success is not the... Professor Einstein, he was very big scientist but he could not solve his death. He was to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Boy! That's amazing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has to die. He could not solve his death and he's a big scientist. What kind of scientist is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Boy!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The real problem remain unsolved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...death is blindness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha? No. That is rascaldom. They do not see the real problem. Neither they're able to solve it. They're simply happy by some... Just like child. The child, he wants to play whole day long. He does not care. Like that. This human life is meant for making a perfect solution of all problems. That they do not care. There is some temporary benefit. They're very much busy and known as scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they'll say that it is ideal. That cannot be attained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But if it can be attained, then you do not know. Then you are foolish. You say that cannot be attained. But I say it is possible. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> states, Kṛṣṇa says-the whole thing is discovered. Simply understand Kṛṣṇa and next life you become eternal. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Simply if you go to our temple and see Kṛṣṇa, you'll be devotee. You don't do anything. Don't talk anything. Simply see Kṛṣṇa. It is so easy. You simply see Kṛṣṇa and take Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and live comfortably and next life you'll go to back to home back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam [Bg. 9.2].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very good. Yes. <span class="Italic">Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam.</span> Another facility, if you cannot finish your Kṛṣṇa job, then whatever you have done, that is permanent. Next life you begin from there. Nothing is lost. <span class="Italic">Abhayam, abhayam,</span> permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's a wonderful offer by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What does it mean to finish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Finish? Finish means fully, you do not know anything except Kṛṣṇa. That is finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pure devotee, yes. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He had no other business than Kṛṣṇa, everything. That is the ideal perfection. [break] <span class="Italic">Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> Everything is vacant without Kṛṣṇa. That is perfection. [break] No, that determination will come automatically when you are advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It's wonderful to hear you talk about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is wonderful, either I talk or you talk. (laughs) He's wonderful. A sweetmeat is sweet. Either you give or I give, it is sweet. [break] ...your scientist will try to understand that "Kṛṣṇa has given us the metal, Kṛṣṇa has given us the intelligence, now we have prepared nice airship, and Kṛṣṇa has given us the sky to fly." Appreciate like that. Then your Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Actually that is the fact. If there was no sky, where would you fly your scientific advancement? And if there was no metal, how could you manufacture? If you had no intelligence, how could you do it? So everything is given by Kṛṣṇa, and you are denying Kṛṣṇa. How fool you are, just see? This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Simply accept that "Everything is given by Kṛṣṇa. We are utilizing it." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Only when Kṛṣṇa takes it away, then they turn to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> "Save us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa wants that much, that you accept that "All facilities are given by Me," that much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, actually that is the fact. But that is done, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are rascals, they do it-they will have to do it-but after many, many births, not immediately. They'll suffer. They'll have to go through so many species of life, and one day they'll come to the understanding, "Yes, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti: </span>'Everything is Kṛṣṇa.' " <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ:</span> "That <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is very rare, very rare."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> When the Indians come to the temple, Prabhupāda, I tell them that <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is not manufactured or rubber stamped. Here Kṛṣṇa says what <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> means. I say that anybody who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness is <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And anybody who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, however great he may be in people's eyes, but he's not <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Durātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> Demon. Yes. <span class="Italic">Māyayāpahṛta-jñānā āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">, moghāśā mogha-karmāṇaḥ.</span> [break] So what is your theory? Do you think that God is under theory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They think so. They concoct. They make up God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you make up God, then is that God? If God is subjected to your manufacturing process, so what kind of God He is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Largely they've come to realize that, so they've turned away from even discussing God. They use their theology simply to make comments about the world situation. Theology today, they do not even discuss deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Sometimes they argue that "God has revealed Himself within my heart, so I don't need to read any books because I have a special connection with God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your revelation and my revelation different. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "Because God has so many different aspects that He reveals a different aspect to everyone."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their argument. Then what is the standard of that aspect? Just like in the material world we see, somebody richer than others. This is also aspect of material situation. So if one is millionaire, he is better than a person who has got a few coins. So similarly, your realization of God and my realization of God, different. So I may be greater realized than you. What do you say, theologian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Well, today, Prabhupāda most of the literature is written on subjects of death of God, an eclipse of God, the fact that the people in general, it's a secular society and no one is even discussing God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they have failed. After discussing when they could not find out actually what is God, they have given up the idea. Failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They think of it as actually a maturity. "We needed to talk about God when we were infants, and now we are advanced."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So maturity, you must give what is that standard God, if it is mature. Mature means you must give the real standard. That is mature. But if nobody of you can give the what is the real standard, then how it is mature? Bali Mardana Prabhu, what do you think? Mature means the final conclusion. Just like in scientific theory. All the scientists come into conclusion, "Yes, this is the..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's just an excuse because they don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes, they don't know. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, they've just become mature atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mature atheists, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Even though... at most they say God just means goodness or truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they do not know what is that goodness. They have no knowledge what is the standard of goodness. Somebody is cutting the throat; he's also good. And somebody is very sober; he is also good. So what is the standard of goodness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> That's what they argue about, write books on. Mostly they make vague references and emotional pleas for goodness and honesty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is that honesty and what is that goodness? They must give some definition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> You've summed it up very nicely, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when you call them just jugglers of words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Where is scientist? Svarūpa Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Here Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what is the standard of goodness according to your scientific view?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say, "Just don't... If someone does what he likes and doesn't hurt anyone else, that's good."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They don't do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "If I just do my thing for God but I don't hurt anyone, that's good."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have no definition for standard of goodness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no many times they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Many times they say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no standard. But we have got definition of God. That is the difference. What is our definition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Supreme controller.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> That person who is complete with all six opulences...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...in total fullness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhagavān. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyāḥ, jñāna-vairāgyayoś caiva ṣaḍ iti bhagavān gaṇaḥ.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They will say that is imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why imagination? It is not imagination. Just like I am a man. I have got hundred dollars. He has got thousand dollars. He has got four thousand or five thousand. In this way we see comparative. One is richer than other, other, other. Then why there shall not be somebody who is richest of all? We see practically. How can you deny? That is God. Power, strength-you are stronger than me, he is stronger than you, he is stronger, like that. But if we find somebody, that nobody is stronger than him, he is God. Education, beauty, all the six opulences, you compare. Because we see comparative, so there must be somebody ideal, above whom there is no more education, no more wisdom, no more beauty. That is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That they are hesitant to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they should be hesitant? That is their foolishness. We see comparative, superlative, in our experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say the concept of God is just imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Imagination? That is atheism. Why imagination? This is the definition of God, that in these six items-richness, beauty, wisdom, strength, influence... So we see, practical world, that there are superlative, comparative. So when it comes to the topmost superlative degree, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They have a system which they call scientific integrity, which, roughly translated, means anything they can't perceive through their gross senses they can't accept as being a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is... Anyone can... Any child can accept. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say, If there was a God, He would be perceivable to everyone, whether they believed in Him or not, He would be so obvious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is available. This is common formula, that we see comparative study of these six opulences. When it is topmost, that is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they say, "We cannot literally see that embodied in any one person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can see, but you have no eyes to see. Suppose there are so many richest person. We have not seen, but they must be admitted. Just like in your country, Rockefeller. So it does not mean-one has not heard about Rockefeller-therefore it does not exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But Rockefeller is constantly having to prove and assert his power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, prove to you, prove to me, but there are many who does not know. So that does not mean the Rockefeller is not existing. Your limited sense cannot approach. Therefore you cannot say that the thing is not existing. That is another rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, on the other hand, they say what you can't say you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I can't say? Why I cannot say? I am saying, that this man is richer than this man. This man is richer than this man. You go on, go on, go on, studying. But if you cannot study, you cannot approach, that is your inefficiency. But there is existing actually. This man is greater than this man, this man is greater than... That's all. But who is that highest educated... That you do not see. That does not mean He is not existing. There must be, because the step is going on. How can you deny this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We cannot see, but someone else can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says He's not manifest to the foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He is... You may not have seen something, but I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say that's the universal cop-out. The universal cop-out is to say that God does not reveal Himself to anyone except His devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is natural. That is natural, if a big man, he reveals to his confidential secretaries, not to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Just like Guru Maharaji. He says you cannot understand that he is God unless you believe in him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That he'll say, "Everyone is God". But there is comparative God. He cannot say that he is as good God as Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, he says that. He says he is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why? You have not shown any lifting of Govardhana Hill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He says you have to believe in him to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why shall I believe? You are present, you show me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> He said if you believe in him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can I believe? You show me; then I believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, no. I bel... Well, they say the same thing about Kṛṣṇa. They say, "Well, bring Kṛṣṇa here and show me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Kṛṣṇa is not present, but you say that you are present, so you show me. Kṛṣṇa is not present. But you are present, you rascal. Show me. Then I shall believe you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, I was just using that as a comparison to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why comparison? Then everyone is God. I want to see that you have got the opulence of God. You are the richest. You are smuggling, and you are richest? You rascal, you smuggle, and you are the richest? I kick on your face. (laughter) Now I challenge you. I shall kick on your face. You save yourself. You save if yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. Pauṇḍraka tried to imitate Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa killed him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They applied that pea,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Pie in his face.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pie. That rascal could not save himself. And he's God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But I was not using the comparison in that sense. The sense I was using it in... to a scientist, if you tell him "You have to believe in Kṛṣṇa to realize He is God..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is not belief, it is fact. It is not... that we protest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But the disciples of Guru Maharaji say the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say they've seen Guru Maharaji lifting Govardhana Hill, and they've seen his universal form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Govardhana Hill, when he lifted, everyone saw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The scientists want to see it also to believe in Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so show him. Show him. But prove him. Then everybody says that... I have got some disciple. I can say also, "I am God. My disciples have seen it. Believe me." Say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that's why they won't believe in Kṛṣṇa. They know that everyone can say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It is accepted by the higher authorities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> All the great sages and saints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where are their higher authorities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They don't accept <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> that Kṛṣṇa lifted Govardhana Hill five thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Like that, they do not believe the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They believe in Alexander the Great and George Washington. Why don't they believe in Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's it. That is their foolishness. Nobody has seen George Washington.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. believing in George Washington is not the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not same thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> George Washington is still a mundane figure, imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, mundane figure, because you have got picture of George Washington, that's... We have got picture of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. You think George Washington fact because you see the picture of, that's all. So we see daily the picture, the photo, the statue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they may accept Kṛṣṇa as a person, but not as God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa is person. Kṛṣṇa is person. God is person. That we accept. God is person. God is not person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> The demons at Kṛṣṇa's time could not even accept Him as God, what to speak of the demons now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Therefore they say, What is the platform of objectivity in determining what's God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is definition. God has show in himself, exhibited Himself. He married sixteen thousand wives. Where is that person who can marry sixteen thousand wife and expand himself in sixteen thousand bodies? Where is that person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say no such person exists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore He is there. He is God, the superexcellent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they say He never did that. That's impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did it. There is a mention in the history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> George Washington didn't do anything which was out out out of the conception of belief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, out of conception, he had no power to do it. He had no power to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Who's conception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Their conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he had no power to do that, neither you have the power. That is the difference between you and God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> In other words, "If God is like me, then I'll accept him as God, but if he's not like me, then he is not God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is... Means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, they say, "If God is absolute, then he has to be obvious to everyone." Just like the sun comes up. The sun is obvious to everyone whether they believe in it or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but who is in the room, closing the room, how he can see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> If they're asleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If somebody's sleeping just like owl, he cannot see the sun. The sun is a fact, but the owl cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The owl can see if it looks at it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but... Therefore if you look, then you'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they think they are looking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are not looking, not in the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> And God is also obvious to them in different manifestations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Birth, death, old age, disease, then trees, sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, these are also different manifestations of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, there's no need to accept that's a God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Well, there are different manifestations of God. Just like we don't know the sun planet in it's full details. We just know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the sun, here it is not fully risen. But there is some place-sun is now full-fledged. But because you are here, you cannot say, "The sun cannot be full fledged." But that's a fact. Now in India, not India, somewhere else, the sun is now twelve o'clock, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because time difference. But they are seeing, "Oh, sun is so full-fledged, so shining." You are not seeing. That is your inefficiency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they are able to experience that by their traveling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so if you travel, you will also experience. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you'll also experience. We don't say that you are unable to, but if you adopt the process you'll also know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> There's a large group today, Śrīla Prabhupāda, called humanists and they have decided that this concept of God is not very useful. We can solve all the problems ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. These are rascals. You see, humanists, they are professing humanists and they are killing so many human beings daily. You see? These are all escapism. What is called? Escaping? They could not find any, I mean to say, solace and now humanity... What they can do? There are so many people suffering in the human society. What they can do? Suppose they are opening hospitals. Is that guarantee for a cure of disease or no death? Then what is the humanity. You cannot do anything. You may advertise yourself, " I have opened so many hospitals and beds." But what you can do? Is that guarantee that there that there will be no disease and everyone will be cured, nobody will die. Then what is the humanitarianism. You cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say, "the best use of a bad bargain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but that is not perfect idea that you want to make people happy, that is humanitism, or what is that? So can you make everyone happy? Is that guarantee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say life means happiness and sadness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then what is your meaning of the humanitism? That is going on. Without your attempt that is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say you can't separate...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that... Without your attempt, somebody has become rich, just on his birth. It is due to your help? A man is born immediately millionaire. So it is not your humanity work. He has got it. And similarly, a man is immediately turned into pauper. You cannot save him. So what is the meaning of your humanitism? You cannot do anything. Vivekananda is crying so many. Rascals, they are simply collecting money and eating themselves. <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> And all the <span class="Italic">daridras</span> are lying on the street. So these are only humbug. It has no meaning. You cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Actually they are so demoniac, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they are advocating so many birth control, and so many things, and they say this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply rascaldom. Simply. <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are going to the darkest region. Because they are killing, they will have to suffer. That they do not know. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> The blind man going forward will fall into the ditch. So this is their rascaldom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardan:</span> Can a person who eats meat obtain a human birth? Or he must be put back into animal species, meat-eaters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he'll become animal, and he'll be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So that means practically all the population.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That animal will become man, and he'll kill him. He'll become animal. This is <span class="Italic">karma-bandhana. Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]. Yajñārthe,</span> in the <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> sometimes there is recommendation of animal sacrifice. Except that, you are bound up. You will have to be killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> The meat-eating also leads to many other sinful activities too, right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, naturally. Meat-eating means he's demon, and demon means he'll act in so many ways, demonic way, and he'll be complicated, one after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> These humanists, Prabhupāda, may try to make some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is humanism. We are trying to save the human being from falling down. This is real humanism, if there is meaning of humanity. We are trying to save everyone, that "Don't fall down. Take full advantage of this human form of life and go back to home, back to Godhead. Be happy." This is humanity. Except this, all bogus, humbug. Except this, all bogus humbug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say that will be this perfect platform, but there's nothing like something perfect. They will explain that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. They are trying to go to the perfect platform, but they have no idea what is perfect. That is their foolishness. Why they are making advancement? Advancement means there must be a goal where you will reach? But you have no goal. You do not know what is that goal, so what is the meaning of your advancement? Why you are wasting time blindly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They want that perfection, but they want it with this body and its paraphernalia. They don't want to give this body up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this body can also be perfect. But you do not know how to make it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Devotees are beginning more and more, Śrīla Prabhupāda, under your instruction, to enter into politics. But the political leaders, they will claim, "Well you have no experience. How can you be qualified to...?"</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got experience. If there is a good man, he'll do, he'll act very nice. That we have got experience. Just like if a man is honest, you can trust him. This is our experience. So similarly, if the leaders be good according to this standard, then the whole human society will be happy. This is our propaganda. We are not after the post, but we have to disclose this rascaldom, that "All these rascals, animals, fools, they are taking the post of leader, and you are suffering repeatedly, but you have no sense that 'How we can be happy with this Nixon and company's leadership?' " So therefore we want to disclose the fact, that's all. We have no ambition. Just like we are brāhmaṇas. We have nothing to do, but according to Vedic civilization, the brāhmaṇas guides the kṣatriyas how to rule. So our position is to reform the politicians. We are not going to compete with them, we have no business, neither we have time. But because people are suffering-we want everyone to be happy-therefore we want to reform these rascals. That is our goal. What we shall do taking part in politics? We have no business. But our real aim is how people will be happy. That is our real aim. So these rascals are leading, misleading. Therefore we want to check them. Is that all right? Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Will this be possible, to reform these leaders, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, just like I came here alone to reform, to make God conscious, but gradually it is increasing. Although I had very little hope, but still now hopeful. So let us try for it. It is not that cent percent people, but if one, two men can understand, leading men, then the whole society will be benefited. It is not that mass people will be reformed. Just like we have received one letter from one Mr. Ford, Ford family, how much he is appreciating our movement. He has paid also. So it is our duty to do. But if one, two men comes out, comes forward, then it will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That Ford boy is about to become a devotee, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he'll become devotee, just like George is becoming devotee. So if somebody comes in our touch and if he is sincere, he'll become devotee. Now this, I shall go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> So therefore, because we're not actually trying to gain the office, there need be no compromise in our preaching. Our preaching can be strictly on the platform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...It always has been.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our, this attempt is for preaching, not for the post. If we get the post it is all right. If we don't get, we are not disappointed. Just like even Kṛṣṇa. He came to preach, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> And did everybody do so, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān?</span> So that it is so sublime... It is not possible. But if one or two men accept, then you are successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> It's just a form of preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The ideal should be there. Just like sometimes university maintains some classes, spending thousands of dollars every month, but there is no student. Does it mean the university shall close that department? No, it must go on. If anyone is fortunate, he'll take advantage. This is process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Among those students, thousands of students, there are only very few who come out very good in society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Not everybody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu,</span> that is already spoken. Kṛṣṇa is speaking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā;</span> at the same time, He says,</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Out of many million of persons are trying to be perfect, and out of many millions of perfect, one can hardly understand Me." Then why He is speaking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Actually the formula is impossible. Nobody is trying for becoming perfect, and there is no perfect; then who will understand? And still, He is speaking. Still Caitanya Mahāprabhu is coming. So our endeavor should be there. Our endeavor should be. If one man can take it up, then there will be immense good for the human so... Therefore I say this is the only humanitarian work. This is the only humanitarian... All others, bogus. They cannot become success. They are opening hospitals, but there are many millions of persons there without any hos..., and even if you give good medicine, good hospital, is that guarantee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So the difference is one is working on the illusory platform...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara: :</span>...and one is working on the absolute platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the difference. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> Therefore a little, if you act in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it will never be lost and it will save you from the greatest danger. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt. Kartum avyayam. Susukhaṁ kartum avyayam [Bg. 9.2].</span> And whatever you have done, that is your permanent asset. It will never be lost. So nowadays the theologicians do not talk of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Not so much, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are interested in politics now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like nowadays they are not talking of going to the moon planet. There is no newspaper news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They have a bigger plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another bluff. Now the small plan they could not make successful. Now they are thinking of bigger plan. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are planning to go to Mars now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is another bluff. Another bluff. The smaller plan, they could not make successful. Now they're attempting bigger plan. <span class="Italic">Bara bara goragere rasatala, beta gora katha jala.</span>(?)<span class="Italic"> Betagor...</span> There is a story that there was river. You know, horse can swim over. So big, big stalwart horses, they waved, mean, they washed away by the flood. So one lean and thin horse is coming, "Can you tell me how much water is there?" It is like <span class="Italic">bara bara goragere rasatala, beta gora katha jala.</span> (?) So these rascals could not reach even the moon planet; now they are planning to the Mars planet. Just see. And another rascal will believe him. That, What you have done for the, which is the nearest planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say they've done everything they wanted to do with the moon. They say they've accomplished everything they wanted to on the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are not successful. That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Basically what they did is they went there and they realized it's not worth anything, so there's no use going there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you bluff again, and you take some money. That's your business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The public interest is flagging, and they're not interested in the moon anymore. They want something more exciting. So to get the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is bluffing. That is bluffing. The scientists want to be engaged and get money from the government, so they must go on bluffing. Otherwise how they'll get money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There was a seminar yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> The seminar was, the title was "The Atmosphere of Mars." The atmosphere in the Mars they are studying now very carefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they're saying it is carbon dioxide and water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the same "carbon dioxide" and big, big words, jugglery of words, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they are hopeful that there may be some life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, they are hopeful of doing everything but never successful, never. That they'll never become. Unless they are hopeful, how... Just like a physician. The man is going to die, still, he's thinking, "Yes, I am hopeful." I have seen in Allahabad high-court. One man was condemned to death, and his lawyer solacing him. "Don't be sorry. I'll appeal, I'll appeal. I'll get you out." You see? This is their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They do want something more exciting, Prabhupāda, but they don't know they want to go to the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is spiritual. They do not know what is this sky even, what to speak of spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Prabhupāda, many theologians will say privately that they believe in God or they want to believe in God but they cannot speak of God to the common people because the people are so agitated, they don't want to hear of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are speaking. We are speaking to the common man. We do not hesitate. We say, "Here is Kṛṣṇa, God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The most active or the most powerful of the theologians, they are very, very conservative Christian, and they say, though, that if they believe in Jesus, they cannot hear of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If they are actually theologians, why they should not hear? Jesus Christ says that he's the son of God. But why not of the father. And what is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They make reference to one... He supposedly said that he was the only way, that no man could come to God the father except through Jesus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so we accept the only way. Take Bible, and we shall prove there is Kṛṣṇa. Take Bible, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> But they will quote a reference in the Bible that says, "No other book."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, don't accept no other book. Take Bible, and we shall prove there is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes, he also said, Prabhupāda, that "God, the heavenly father, who is greater than me, He has sent me here."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is Bible. Yes. Here is. Practically nowadays there is no Christian. All heathens. Yes. Because they are... Therefore we are purchasing so many churches. And there are so many for sale. Nobody is going to. In London I have seen. Hundreds of churches are... some neighbor. Nobody goes. Only the churchtaker and the so-called one or two neighboring old women, that's all. So it is gone. Christian religion is now gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Also, Prabhupāda, Christ never said himself that he's dying for their sins. But this is the later disciples of Christ, they claim that Christ has died for their sins.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> This is the fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> That's fact, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how they are. They're saying so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Cheaters. In Germany since they lost the war everyone has become atheists. In Germany, because they lost the war, they all became atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It's better sometimes to approach a person with no religion, Prabhupāda, than to approach a Christian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> These Christians are very blasphemous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Very blasphemous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Party spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, what is their value? When they are sanctioning abortion, homosex, now they are finished. They have no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, most or a greater proportion of the traditional Christians condemn homosex and abortion. A good quantity of the traditional Christians, they condemn abortion and homosex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are good, but mostly, as you were telling me that, that Pope is disgusted... Yes. Nobody cares for the Bible or the Pope. That is everywhere, not only Christian. Actually there is no religion at the present moment. All animals. We don't blame only the Christians. The Hindus, Muslim, everyone. They have lost all religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Actually Prabhupāda, I read in the <span class="Italic">Time Magazine</span> that Indira Gandhi, she said to one reporter her birth control program has not become successful because in Kerala there are a lot of Catholics who are opposing this kind of process. In other words the Hindus are approving of it but the Catholics are rejecting it, it looks like, to some extent. She says that because the Catholics in Kerala, they are opposing the birth control program so she has got trouble like that. She is completely atheistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless she become atheist how you can stay in that post? She must be atheist. Or she may not be atheist, but for political reasons she must become atheist. Otherwise she cannot maintain her post. All these politicians, they are simply duplicity. Actually they are something else, but in political post they must show themselves as something else. This is politics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When Nehru said that all factories, chemical factories and these iron factories are our temples, these are our temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Nehru was a big atheist too, he openly declared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he was first-class atheist. Now he has become a dog. Yes, some astrologer has said. He has become a dog in Sweden. A man has got two dogs. Out of the two he is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Nehru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is quite believable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes Prabhupāda, it's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How does he know that is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> It's fortunate to become a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha? The astrologers, they sometimes approached. Ah, what is the position of this man, Vivekananda, Ramakrishna, Gandhi? And they say something. So he has said about Nehru like this. Astrologer, he was hesitating, then he said. It was spoken by one very respectable person, Śrīdhara Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My godbrother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīdhara Mahārāja. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Similarly also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, some astrologers say that Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Suppose if he has said, how can you disbelieve it? How can you disbelieve it? That is... Because in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> "After giving up this body, one has to accept another body." So he has accepted another body but nobody can tell what body he has accepted. If the astrologer says, you have to accept it. You cannot say, "No, he has not accepted dog body." You cannot give any proof. So anyone can say anything. But it is a fact that he has accepted another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. That you cannot deny because it is said by Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptir dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That you cannot deny. He has accepted another body. What kind of body he has accepted... If you want to suggest, that is also given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, </span></div>
<div class="Verse">ūrdhvaṁ gacchanti sattva-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>madhye tiṣṭhanti rājasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jaghanya-guṇa-vṛtti-sthā<br class="calibre2"/>adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>14.18]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">He was in tāmasic, so he has gone down to the animal kingdom. That's a fact in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He has gone to the animal kingdom. Now he may be tiger or dog. That is a different thing. But he has gone to the animal kingdom. That is the verdict of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> He looks a little like a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adho gacchanti tāmasāḥ,</span> he was in completely <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He claimed himself to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And he was eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He never claimed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He never claimed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He never claimed. He said, "You call me <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That's your... but I, I do not follow anything." He never said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And Mahatma Gandhi, Prabhupāda, he said Rāma, Rāma, Rāma three times before he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So he'll get birth as human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, are these astrologers, ah, are, can we believe in them, what they say? Called pseudo-science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Astrology is a science. [break] ...that I shall go to the foreign countries and throughout the whole world I will establish so many temples, so many things... this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So they have some intelligence to tell that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is calculation, calculation. This astrologer, this astrologer was a very big astrologer and when I was in service, Dr. Bose's laboratory, so Dr. Bose was treating one patient. He was vomiting blood. So he was treating as tuberculosis. Then he could not cure him after giving all medicine. Then he asked the astrologer, this astrologer who made my horoscope, "What is the matter? Panditji, can you tell?" So he calculated. He said, "You are making wrong treatment. He has got some sore in the throat. It is not heart." And he treated, he was cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Vedic science is so perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He knew it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Who is this Dr. Bose, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Jagadishacandra Bose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's another Bose. There is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> There is a Bose Institute in Calcutta in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is, (coughs) that is Sir Jagadishacandra Bose. Sir J.C. Bose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...who discovered, he discovered this wireless telegraph.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Wasn't that your father's friend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He, this, he's Dr. Karttikacandra Bose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a road, K.C. Bose, Dr. Karttikacandra Bose Street. He was my father's friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Did you work for Jagadishacandra Bose too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I worked for Dr. Dr. K.C. Bose, under whose name the street is going on, Dr. Karttikacandra Bose. He's also famous man, this Bose. He was the, I mean to say, the starter of this Bengal Chemical Company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Oh yes, they are a big company.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dr. Bose's labora... Practically chemical industry was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think it was Acarya Prafullacandra Raya, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that starting of chemical industry in the Bengali...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Acarya Prafullacandra Raya was one of the director and this K.C. Bose was a managing director. Actually the life was given by Dr. Karttikacandra Bose to Bengal Chemical. But because Prafullacandra Raya was a famous chemist and he was attached to it, therefore his name become famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Also you mentioned Mullik family in Calcutta to be your grandparents or someone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> That is also mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One of the members was our relative. So we are staying with them, these Mulliks. He had no sons. So we were staying, some relatives. Therefore I was born in that family, although they are our distant relations. But when I was, my father was staying there, I was born. These Mulliks they are also De. Their original title is De. This Mullik is their title.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> For being in the Mohammedan service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not service. Sometimes the Mohammedans used to give... Just like the British government used to give titles, "Sir", like that. Mullik, Mullik comes from the word "mallika".</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Mallika means owner, the owner?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mullik, Chaudhuri, Raya. These are Mohammedan titles. Khan. Like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> ...family names, we said two family names, like Raya Chaudhuri, like Datta Gupta. How this happened?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like the Mulliks they're De Mullik. The original title is De but they got the title Mullik. Similarly, there is another family. They are called Sil Mullik. The original title is Sil but they got the title. As De we belong to the same family. But because, somehow or other, they got this title, so they... It is not different but... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> <span class="Italic">...Gaura-gaṇoddeśa-dīpikā</span> in which you, all the original <span class="Italic">svarūpa</span> of all the devotees are given?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> So most of the Lord Caitanya's associates were <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Associates...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some of them <span class="Italic">gopīs</span>, some of them cowherd boys, some of them father, mother, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In Bengal, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> caste family like Mukherjees, then Bannerjees, then,... I had a roommate when I was in Calcutta, his was Mukherjee. So he was telling me one day that we are much more superior <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> than other like Chaudhuris and Sanyals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is your superiority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He was explaining like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But what is your superiority. You're a servant now. You're <span class="Italic">śūdra</span>. You're not even a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Superiority by simply explanation will not do. You must be (indistinct). <span class="Italic">Guṇa, karma,</span> superiority means <span class="Italic">guṇa, karma</span>. You must have the quality and you must work in that quality. You're a scientist, but after a few generation, a foolish boy in your family say, "We belong to the scientist's family." So what is the use of saying like that? You must become scientist. When you are a scientist then you are superior not by simply... This has killed the Indian, I mean Vedic culture when they began to claim superiority simply by birth without any qualification. That killed the whole civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But I think tradition must be still...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But tradition, what is that tradition? Tradition is here, in the proof. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> The reference is given to the quality, <span class="Italic">guṇa,</span> and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> and action. How you can simply say that because I'm born in such and such family, therefore I have also the same thing. Because my father was high-court judge, therefore I am high-court judge. Is that very good logic? How you became superior? You have to prove your superiority by your qualification and actual work. This is very nice. The world is accepting like that. Somebody's coming to you to accept some scientific instruction. He accepts you're superior in scientific knowledge, not for your birth, but for your quality and work. That is fact. So you first of all come to the platform of the quality and work, then you claim superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes. That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that foolishness has killed the whole Vedic civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I thought the same way before I became a disciple of Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is a... He comes from a very respectable <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, but he knows...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Well I realized afterwards that I was lower than a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> because actually it was my duty and I rejected it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why we are accepting in Europe and America all them <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> They are not born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. But why we are giving them sacred thread? Only for quality and work. That is said in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Nārada Muni says that the quality and the symptoms is the real platform of judging who is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who is <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Nārada said and Śrīdhara Svāmī has commented upon him that birth is immaterial. Quality and work is (indistinct). Otherwise how Caitanya Mahāprabhu can accept Haridāsa Ṭhākura as <span class="Italic">nāmācārya,</span> the authority of the Holy Name? He was born in a Mohammedan family. And this Sanātana Gosvāmī, they are rejected from <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family because they're servants of Nawab Hussain Shah and they adopted Muslim way of life. Their name was also changed-Dabira Khāsa, Sākara Mallika, this Mallika (laughs), Sākara Mallika. But although they're born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, but they're rejected from the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family because they accepted service. Formerly the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> were so strict. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> cannot accept any service. Then he becomes <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> To accept service is the business of the <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> And it is warned in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> If a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> becomes economically poor, he may act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> not as a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Then it will be quite degradation. So now this, what is this <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he's in service?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think he's a physicist now. I think he came here about one year before I came here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if he's in service, then he's <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's <span class="Italic">śūdra, paricaryātmakaṁ karma śūdra-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as one accepts service of a master, immediately <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> True <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> even didn't care for kings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They didn't care for the honor from king or they didn't, they would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They would give advice to the kings but never accept the post of a king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So every <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> had to have something to manage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was a regular advisory committee, privy council, composed of high learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and saintly persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think people who say like this they are jealous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are jealous of the other people who are coming up higher than them. So, seeing them, they are quite jealous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> These so-called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must be jealous because if simply by taking birth in a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family he can become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and if somebody protests then he, he becomes jealous... (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...better to call a small meeting of the learned scholars and talk with them about our philosophy because even if you advertise common man is not interested.
