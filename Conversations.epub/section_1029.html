<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I am the sunshine and moonshine." You cannot see sunshine and moonshine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But sir, the sunshine is the <span class="Italic">hiraṇyagarbha.</span> That too is the product. That is material. There is something beyond the sunshine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For God there is nothing material. For God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I think that's what <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> says. <span class="Italic">Om īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> So what is material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Yat kiñca jagatyāṁ jagat tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is <span class="Italic">sarvam,</span> then what is material?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (laughs) It's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> This way! This way! This way! This way! This way!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is it. The car's this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Okay child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...simply, <span class="Italic">prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span> Why they cannot see? Here is <span class="Italic">prabhā</span> of the <span class="Italic">sūrya.</span> Where is the difficulty? <span class="Italic">Prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ.</span> [break] ...this man thinks about death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Well, modernized man is mostly either afraid of the death or he doesn't know of the death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Afraid of death everyone. There is no doubt. Unless he's a madman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But then a... I don't think anybody believes he will be afraid even there is a change of birth or change of body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may say so, but actually they are. As soon as there is some signal of death they are very much disturbed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I don't think one should be afraid of death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, afraid means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Because this is something which has to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. But nobody wants to die. That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But then you feel that when you feel like living anything in the life you feel after some time that he must have a change. So this is also... [break] ...feel that this is a change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That change he doesn't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But modernized man is more busy in his own life. When only he gets into bad time then he thinks "What is this?" But otherwise I think he has no time to think of these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (British):</span> They think once you're dead you're dead and that is the end of it. They don't... They think "We'll enjoy now and we shall die and that's the finish." If you say to somebody, "Have you heard about reincarnation?" "I do not believe in this." Many people in the West cannot accept that the soul will transcend into another body, move on or move down. To them it's fantasy and humbug. This is why they are afraid. They are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> This is same reincarnation. They think that he has gone. I won't be going, so I'll keep everything with me. We attend so many places where people die and we think, "Oh, he is gone but maybe I am not going to go."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The ancient Egyptians used to put all their treasures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We don't understand that "All right, this is the end." So why not we understand and think in that line? That day you said that by chanting he thinks that he's chanting, maybe other people don't chant. So they don't know that they have to go. They think they are going to survive here only. They don't want to accept that they have to go, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not want death. That I have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Yes. But definitely others are going and we won't go also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he doesn't want to die. That is a concoction. Other side is that he doesn't want to die. It is the expression of the same sentiment in a different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But then you see after the childhood and the young age and when he becomes old and after old also there is end you know, when he becomes helpless to do anything, then what is the use of having this body? Even your own relations, they'll feel that this is a burden. So at that time I think it's very good, that person himself should feel that all right, he must leave this body now. It's useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he doesn't want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, some people don't want. Or many people don't want. There are a few, I think maybe one in thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Does this mean Śrīla Prabhupāda, we should not speculate about the future. Like if someone says, "Next year we should do this," and so forth. And "Next month we'll go here and we'll do that." And people are always making arrangements for the future and what they are going to do. With nothing in mind that death will take them within a flash. And they're making all these speculative arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I personally feel that when you buy anything in the market, for example you buy a dress. Sometimes it wears for ten years, sometimes you are cheated and it wears only for two years. So this is also same way, you know. Sometimes early death means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for the dress. What about the man who's using the dress? You are identifying the dress with the man. That is foolishness. As soon as you say "dress," you should have to find out the man who has got the dress. Then it is perfect understanding. But if you understand the dress and the man the same, then you are foolish. Dress is not the man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> No, dress is not the soul, but dress is again the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dress is the body. <span class="Italic">Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is explained. This body is just like dress. So, but the dress is different from the man who puts on the dress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Well, that is different. Man is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The dress, it becomes old and it will be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But dress is the body. Dress is the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We have to put up with so much pain for it. You see, we're not this body and to forget that we're not this body, but still every minute we're given pain to remember that this body is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You stub your toe and it gives so much pain just for something so small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you are eating? (pause) So water is wasted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, it's dripping still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Tap must not be working. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...so the front is always full of water for people, birds to take. But all the water is dripping over the side and it's being wasted on the ground. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rādhā-Vallabha, it is offered to Rādhā-Vallabha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What's that made from, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There's a kind of <span class="Italic">puri</span> with some filling, <span class="Italic">dāl.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">kacuri?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not <span class="Italic">kacuri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, you've taught so... [break] ...instruction for cooking this <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have seen, I have seen. In our family, I know. That's all. But from my childhood it is my nature, if somebody is preparing, I see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It seems to me that most people in India can cook something. Even if there's just <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> they can do this. But people in the West, they now are so helpless. They buy everything it seems in packets and you would not know how to prepare any food as much as just to cut the packet and pour it out and even then they don't even know how to put water into the pan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know how to eat on the whole. India knows how to eat. (Pause) I have traveled all over the world, and this is my experience. Nobody knows how to eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Nowhere at all, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only India. [break] ...every province they have got different dishes. Because the woman, they are trained up how to cook very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I even see these boys when I was in Chandigarh, in a dish next door to the temple we were starting there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Woman is meant for that purpose, how to make nice palatable dishes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Just these young boys who were carrying the bricks every morning, they would prepare their own vegetables and <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis</span> like this, and I was amazed to see this because you would never get anyone doing this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> In Bengal there is a ceremony after marriage, <span class="Italic">bahu-bhāta.</span> (?)The newly married girl, she shall cook, and all the relatives, friends, are invited and they appreciate, "Yes, nice cook." Then she is accepted as member of the whole family. <span class="Italic">Bahu-bhāta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And if not, Prabhupāda? If her cooking is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore she is trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And if she's not trained up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She must be trained up. Just like Rādhārāṇī, She was trained up in sixty-four arts. Do you think to captivate Kṛṣṇa is easy thing? How much qualified She must have been so that Kṛṣṇa was attracted. (loud laughing in background) What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Laughing is also exercise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Standing in a ring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Exercise they are doing. To laugh loudly you know that is also exercise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's a form of <span class="Italic">prāṇāyāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> A form of <span class="Italic">prāṇāyāma,</span> breathing. The scientists, or doctors, say it takes so many muscles in the body to laugh and so many to frown, and it takes less to laugh, so they say why waste energy? Everyone should laugh instead of frowning all the time and be happy. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Ninth Canto, I shall take up Eleventh and Twelfth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Someone was explaining about these Cantos that you start like the feet from Kṛṣṇa and as you read through the Cantos you slowly move up the body of Kṛṣṇa and the Twelfth Canto is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is His head. The Twelfth Canto must be a really beautiful book, too. (Hindi) (end)</div>
