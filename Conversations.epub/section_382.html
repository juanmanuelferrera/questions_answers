<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and they would all come to our place in procession, and we shall feed them. This program should be started immediately. And so that the whole day and night this nuisance will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Maybe we should occupy the L.I.C. grounds in Delhi with <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> We should occupy the L.I.C. grounds in Delhi with <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... No, you are jumping over... Now, the question is in Bombay. Why you are jumping in Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> But they asked us in L.I.C. the same thing. They asked us to leave L.I.C. grounds because the <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> was nuisance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. That chapter is now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...in prominence. Don't come near.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We could go to the... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that they're planning the same plan as they did. This is the preliminary sign.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gupta:</span> Swami Mahārāja, our program should enter the streets in the houses of different people and <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> should be start from there, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it! So don't speak. Now organize. Now there is no question of speaking. Practical. Everyone should take a leading part, and the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> nuisance should be started from Bombay. So Balavanta Prabhu, you are taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes [break] ...assistants selected, so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> and do it. You take the leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence. [break] And we shall pollute the whole world with this nuisance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya. Haribol.</span> (breaks)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...become an exemplary <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> to give fight to the <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs</span> here. You are, how many years you are in Vṛndāvana? Huh? How many years you are here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Two and half years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two and a half years. Now you should represent Rūpa Gosvāmī, and you should challenge them, "You are not <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> I am <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span>" But you have to be exemplary. Do you know what is the definition of <span class="Italic">gosvāmī?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> One who works hard for Kṛṣṇa day and night and one who controls his senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the first thing. <span class="Italic">Vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegam udara-vegam upastha-vegaṁ manasa-vegam, etān vegān yo viṣaheta dhīraḥ pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt</span> [NoI 1]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who can control these kinds of urges, <span class="Italic">vāco vegam,</span> talking nonsense-that is called <span class="Italic">vāco vegam. Krodha-vegam,</span> anger. Urges of the mind. Mind dictates, "Do this, do that." Then <span class="Italic">udara-vegam,</span> eating <span class="Italic">vegam.</span> "Eat more, more, more." <span class="Italic">Udara-vegam. Upastha-vegam.</span> Genital. When one can control these six <span class="Italic">vegān,</span> urges, then he is fit for becoming <span class="Italic">gosvāmī,</span> and he can make <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> all over, <span class="Italic">śiṣya,</span> disciple, all over the world. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt.</span> This is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> Not that a business. (Hindi) Is there any mention <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam?</span> There are so many big, big commentators. They have never recommended. But this business is going on. They are holding <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-saptāha</span> and bringing money and employing it for the sons', daughters' marriage very opulently. And the, their supporters, they're also invited. They say, "Oh here is a <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span>"<span class="Italic"> </span>This is going on here. [break] ... of <span class="Italic">gosvāmī,</span> there is not a single <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> At least visible. Where is that <span class="Italic">vāco vegaṁ krodha-vegam udara upastha-vegam [NoI 1]</span> control? And where is that <span class="Italic">pṛthivīṁ sa śiṣyāt,</span> all world-wide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes, disciples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Ah, where is that? <span class="Italic">Śiṣya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may be whatever I am. That's all. But this is the definition of <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> Besides that, there are other, many things.</div>
<div class="Verse">nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau<br class="calibre2"/>lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau<br class="calibre2"/>rādhā-kṛṣṇa-padāravinda-bhajanānandena-mattālikau<br class="calibre2"/>vande rūpa-sanā(tanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau)</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So <span class="Italic">nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇa.</span> One must be very conversant, all kinds of <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> And what for? For establishing real religion. Real religion is this: <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why there are other religions existing? That means there is no <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs. Gosvāmī...</span> If there is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī,</span> he should stop functioning all other rascal religions. Simply this: <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja,</span> that religion. That is religion. And all bogus thing. A <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> has to prove that. <span class="Italic">Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-ni... lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau.</span> Why? For the benefit of the whole human society. Therefore they should be honored. <span class="Italic">Tri-bhuvane mānyau.</span> Not that within some neighborhood. All over the world. <span class="Italic">Tri-bhuvane.</span> That is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī.</span> What is this <span class="Italic">gosvāmī? Tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau.</span> He is fit to take shelter of. A cheating <span class="Italic">gosvāmī,</span> cheating <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> is no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> I also, I also, the first day kicked a <span class="Italic">pāṇḍā</span> out because he wouldn't eat <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> with us. He said, "I am Vaiṣṇava. I cannot eat amongst you." So I said, "Then we cannot hear from you. Go immediately." The first day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He wanted to go and have tea. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...money, but not your <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money's pure. (laughter) And <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> because it is offered to Kṛṣṇa, it is impure. Just see their argument. Money is pure. Even you can give me with your hand as much as you like. Because it is pure, I'll take it. And so far <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> is concerned, because it is offered to Kṛṣṇa, therefore I cannot take it. [break] Oh yes. She has got the power. Śakti-mati Sar. Some... The police commissioner has remarked, "This <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> is nuisance." So we have to agitate. There are so many Vaiṣṇavas. <span class="Italic">Bhajana</span> is nuisance? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there must be some big agitation to drive away this man. The demand should be that "This man should be immediately removed. He has focused a sarcastic remark on a very pure religious system." This movement should be started. He must be removed immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> We can hold protest marches downtown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Large. Large scale protest marches.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> All the Vaiṣṇavas will come with us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have to organize all... There are many Vaiṣṇavas. Eh? In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto mām [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to chant "Kṛṣṇa" always. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> And this rascal is saying "nuisance." So it is not possible to invoke an agitation against this? What right he has got to say nuisance? He could have spoken in a sweet language that "The <span class="Italic">bhajana</span> may be very good for the devotees, but it creates disturbance to the others. Therefore we cannot allow." I say like that. But they cannot still stop <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span> But he has remarked the <span class="Italic">bhajana:</span> "Nuisance." This very word will kill him if you make proper agitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> That means the whole government is feeling that way. Otherwise he would not feel strong in saying it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact, but we have to become strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes. We must defeat them all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> We can mainly single out him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> We can mainly single him out for now and protest against him, make him the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Make an example of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> The man in Bombay, government leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many parties in Bombay, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> parties. You have to organize them and bring them. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa everywhere. Create this nuisance. And Maharashtra is the country of Tukārāma. He organized <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Still the <span class="Italic">Tukārāma kīrtana</span> parties are there. Viṭṭhala. Viṭṭhala means Kṛṣṇa. And ideal <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> should remain here to challenge these false <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs.</span> But if you also become false, then you cannot challenge. [break] ...have come, we can talk with them. Mr. Gupta, your <span class="Italic">pathaks</span> (?), they have come. Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Jayo.</span> (Hindi) [break] ...have sufficient quantity of grains, then you are <span class="Italic">dhanavān.</span> This is all false, so-called <span class="Italic">dhanavān.</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Annād bhavanti bhūtāni [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to flourish, you must have sufficient grains. Where is that grain? Some... (Hindi) Lecture. What is that lecture? Where is <span class="Italic">anna?</span> [break] (Hindi) This is going on. (Prabhupāda describes in Hindi how <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> describes the present government leaders as dogs, hogs, camels and asses; and other topics) <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the only... (Hindi) Our movement is Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. Everyone knows. (Hindi conversation with Indian woman continues for some time.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like Dhṛtarāṣṭra, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like Dhṛtarāṣṭra. Still they are told that Kṛṣṇa is God, and they still do not heed the warning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them accept at least like Dhṛtarāṣṭra. That is also good. Therefore Dhṛtarāṣṭra was saved at the end, in spite of so many things. By the help of Vidura, he left home and became successful, because he believed in Kṛṣṇa, that "Kṛṣṇa is God, yes. But I cannot control myself." He admitted his deficiency. Therefore he was liberated. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> Because he admitted Kṛṣṇa is God, therefore at the end he was liberated. <span class="Italic">Mahato bhayāt.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> But Duryodhana would not admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Even though Kṛṣṇa showed His universal form, Duryodhana still did not agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Duryodhana also agreed. All of them got salvation. That is mentioned. Anyone who was in the Battle of Kurukṣetra, all of them got salvation. By their being killed in the battle, they all got liberation and salvation. That is stated by Bhīṣmadeva. <span class="Italic">Svarūpa. Svarūpa</span> means they came to their original Kṛṣṇa consciousness. All of them. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... [break] (Hindi conversation continues for some time) Materially to get <span class="Italic">bācche</span> (children) you require the help of husband, but spiritually you don't require anyone's help. In Kṛṣṇa only. That's all. (end)</div>
