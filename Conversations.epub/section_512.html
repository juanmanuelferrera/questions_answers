<div class="Normal-Level">(Prabhupāda plays harmonium and sings <span class="Italic">"Gāy Gorā Madhur Sware</span>" for a few minutes, then stops.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I can't. Nobody can do like you do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gāy gorācand madhur sware.</span> I think I have sung this song. Huh? (Prabhupāda continues playing and singing for a few more minutes) Wherefrom you have purchased it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> This harmonium was originally made for Nara-nārāyaṇa, and then it was... but it was never delivered to him. It was picked up by Maṇibaṇḍha. And Maṇibaṇḍha left it in Amsterdam, and so they did not like it. So I gave them a harmonium that I had, and I took this one. (Prabhupāda chuckles) Because I think it's very good, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not <span class="Italic">very</span> good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But it's nice. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is going on, here and there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, yeah, everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paris also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen that house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No, I didn't see it. I was only there just twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think you change that silk cloth. Ordinary cloth is, because it does not stand, it becomes loose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Plain cotton.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cotton is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that land, what is the description of the land here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> That I was telling you about?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You know the lady in the front here. There's this lady, Miss... Um, I can't think of her name. She called us yesterday, and she said it is much bigger than the land which we have purchased here, which is four acres. We bought four acres. So she didn't say how big it was. She didn't tell us. But she said there's several houses on it. And it will cost approximately 38,000 pounds. So it seems to be quite a sizable piece of land. And the man who owns the property, he knows that we are interested in it, and he is willing to work with us. And so far as we are told, that nobody knows about it. It is confidential. (end)</div>
