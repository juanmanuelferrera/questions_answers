<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you understand by the word <span class="Italic">"māyā"?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> That which is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Things which we place value on that have no relation to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is explained very nicely in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, yathābhāso yathā tamaḥ.</span> Just like sun is reflected in the water, and the light is reflected again on the wall. This is the exact explanation of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Reality, this material world, the man who manufactured all these things, nobody knows where he has gone, but these things are taken as reality. This will be also finished. It will remain as relics, as Rome, relics, but when it was..., the houses were prepared with great enthusiasm as reality. And now it is as relics. So the energy expended for manufacturing those house, that is also <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and now they are being visited as relics. That is also <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So all these things are <span class="Italic">māyāra vaibhava,</span> expansion of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So if somebody says that you don't appreciate these things? No, we appreciate, very much appreciate intelligence. But if you, for this appreciation, if you forget, then it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Forget Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Otherwise, it is reality. If they would have installed Deity worship in these buildings, how much nice it would have been. People chanting, dancing, and taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> twenty-four hours. Then it is no more <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> It is reality. Such big, big, nice houses, they should have been places of worshiping Kṛṣṇa. But they're worshiping bones, keeping some dead bones, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> People must be educated that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. Why they do not understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The government argues that they do not want to discriminate against any religious faith. So they remain secular.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is no governmen... Religious faith is different. That is nonsense. You, we are talking of science. We are, just like we were saying that everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa. So where is the, any religious feeling? Everything belongs to Kṛṣṇa, how you can say no? Can you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They can say, "We don't know Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't know Kṛṣṇa, but it belongs to somebody. He may be named as Kṛṣṇa or something else. That doesn't matter. But it is, it does not belong to you. How you can deny it? You have come here... Suppose I have come here, in Paris. I stay here for one week, two. Does it mean Paris is mine? Similarly, you come from the womb of your mother and stay here, say, fifty years. That is mean yours? The same example. Does it mean that the world belongs to you? Why you are claiming, "This is France," "This is Europe," "This is America," "This is mine," "This is mine..."? Before your birth it was there, and when you go, it will remain there. So how you claim that it is yours? So you don't... You must know as it remained, it was there before my birth, and it will remain after my departure. Then how it belongs to you? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It belongs to the man who created it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It belongs to the man who created it and is conscious of its origin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who created? Who created? You created this stones and sand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The life force working behind...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They'd say the life force is working...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore nature is... Behind the nature, there is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa... [Bg. 9.10].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> How is it possible, Śrīla Prabhupāda? We're so tiny, one ten-thousandth the tip of a hair, and yet we can become so puffed-up as to think that even I am God or I am the controller of the material nature like the scientists are thinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are in the bodily concept of life, they are thinking, "I'm not teeny, small particle. I am this big, fatty body." He's thinking like that. Just like a dog is thinking, "I am bulldog." It is like that, the same concep...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So that idea just in the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is animalism. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...performing these works and these creations independent of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The materialist sees himself acting independent of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he's independent of God? Napoleon wanted to finish that arch, and he was kicked out. How he's independent of God. Such a big person, strong person, he wanted to finish, but he was not allowed to finish. Then how he thinks that he's independent. That is foolishness, that I can be kicked out at any moment, and still he's thinking "I am independent." What is the answer? Why he was kicked out? He was a very powerful man, and why he was kicked out? "No, you cannot finish. You go, get out immediately." Then? Where is his independence. He was simply falsely puffed-up independent. And now, after being kicked out, if he has taken the body of a cat and dog, then what is the benefit? <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> The nature is so strong and the laws are so stringent. We are not independent. If you touch fire, fire is one of the elements, it will burn your finger. However powerful you may be, you cannot stop it. Then where is your independence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> We studied a verse yesterday evening in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the Eighteenth Chapter. Kṛṣṇa says, "Work always under My protection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says to always work under His protection, that "One may be engaged in all sorts of activities, but, in the end, by My grace, you will come back to Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So the activities of the materialistic man, then, no matter what he does, he will develop another material body for it. (indistinct) Is that right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> And a devotee is acting, but he's not getting any mental impression? From his activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His mind is being... His mental expression is Kṛṣṇa. He's always thinking of Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma. We have got some propensity to create. Just like this beautiful place. We have got creative energy. Therefore it is advised that <span class="Italic">nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe.</span> Make it for Kṛṣṇa. You'll find in India, they have also created big, big temples, four flight, but for Kṛṣṇa. Then the energy spent for creating this park, in relationship with Kṛṣṇa will be utilized as service to Kṛṣṇa. And if it simply meant for sense gratification, then you are under the laws of nature, contaminated. Just like if a man is very powerful, he's creating this park, but he is contaminated with some infection, he, will he not suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> He must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Does it mean that because he has created this park, therefore contamination will not act upon him? Is it a fact? It must act. So after creating all these things, if you contaminate some infectious modes of material nature, then you have to accept the body of cats and dogs. Then what is your benefit? <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-sango 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">. Kāraṇam,</span> the reason for high and low grade birth is due to contamination with the modes of material nature. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yesterday, we said that, Prahlāda Mahārāja said that he didn't fear Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva, even though he was so ferocious, but he feared the material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is contamination. If I be contaminated with the material nature, then I'll have to accept a body given by material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But it's said that a devotee's supposed to be fearless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It is said that a devotee is supposed to be fearless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fearless because devotee means one who has taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa. He's devotee. He's fearless. And one who has not taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, how he can be fearless? Suppose there is epidemic disease, if you have got vaccination, then you can remain fearless. Otherwise, the epidemic will contaminate and then you'll have to suffer. So Kṛṣṇa is the vaccination to remain fearless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You have used the example, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that just like a little child, when he's near his father, he knows he has nothing to worry about. His father will protect him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... Today, it is cold, eh? Where is our Karandhara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Karandhara Prabhu. He's here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are feeling very cold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Not too cold, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am feeling. Old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like this blanket also, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that's all right. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So as soon as the modes of nature are no longer working on the spirit soul, then he experiences that he's no longer changing his body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā dura... mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> By taking shelter of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The thing is that if I am so much susceptible to the contamination of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the modes of material nature, then if I waste my time in material advancement of life, is it not risky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Very risky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Just the other morning, you were lecturing that just because we are young, we should not waste a moment here and think that "Oh, I have so much time to live. Let me put off Kṛṣṇa consciousness..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is fall consciousness. Prahlāda Mahārāja said: "immediately..." <span class="Italic">Kaumāra ācaret prājño dharmān bhāgavatān [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> No waste after. Our policy is that. Therefore we have opened Dallas, that immediately, from the very beginning of life let them understand Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda if the devotee is fearless, how is it that Prahlāda was expressing his fearfulness of material nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> If the devotee is fearless, how is it Prahlāda was expressing his fearfulness of the material nature?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Even you are fearless, you should not be fool. Because, if you know that "There is danger, I must be very careful," that is intelligence. That is not fearfulness. Besides that, a devotee like Prahlāda, he's fearless, but he's fearful for others. That is stated. Just like the mother. She knows that she'll not catch fire, she'll not fall down in the water, but she is always anxious to see her child that the child may not fall into the water, may not catch fire. She's working in her own way, but always fearful of the child. Similarly, a Vaiṣṇava, he's not fearless for himself, but because he's sympathetic, because he knows that all these rascals, they are wrongly wasting their time, therefore he's anxious, fearful. <span class="Italic">Para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span> They are unhappy by seeing others unhappy. For themselves, there is no unhappiness. That is their grace. And Vaiṣṇava is fearless, even if he's sent to hell, he's not unhappy. Because wherever he goes, he'll chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. So actually he has no fear, fearfulness. He is only unhappy... Just like we are talking. Others may think that we are criticizing, but we are actually talking. Suppose this, one who has manufactured this big park and he has, next life, he has become contaminated, the dog's life, then what is the use? How you can guarantee that you are not going to be a dog? It is under the management of material nature, <span class="Italic">maram</span> (?), very powerful. Just like even a big man like Napoleon, he's also under the control of material nature. As soon as the time is... "Get out." "No, I want to finish this arch." "No, sir, you get out." Then where is your powerfulness? That they do not know. For the temporary power, they become puffed up and go to hell. That's all. But they have no conception of hell. These are primitive ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> It's sometimes very hard to feel a compassion for others when we ourselves are still feeling so much contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We, in the neophyte stage, we're feeling ourselves so much attacked by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> that sometimes it's very difficult...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore those who do not take risk, they do not remain within this material world. They go to the Himalaya, go to the forest. They are afraid of being contaminated. But more liberal devotees, they take the risk and "Never mind, I shall go to hell. Let me do something for Kṛṣṇa. Let others may understand something of Kṛṣṇa." That is their, mean magnanimity, taking the risk of going to hell, still, giving the information, "Just try to understand Kṛṣṇa." So such persons are exalted. Because they are taking their own risk to serve Kṛṣṇa. That at least one man may understand Kṛṣṇa. And others, they are flying, flying away, fleeing away, "No, no. We are not going to take risk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa says that there's no one more dear to Me than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Goṣṭhyānandī</span> and <span class="Italic">bhajanānandī. Bhajanānandī</span> means they are interested for their own welfare, and <span class="Italic">goṣṭhyānandī,</span> he wants to see that more devotees are there. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually, Prahlāda Mahārāja said that he's not feeling any anxiety for himself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He's feeling anxiety that they're not taking to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're... And, on account of his being so, taking the risk, he is immediately very dear to Kṛṣṇa. That is declared in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Anyone who is trying to broadcast My message, My glory, he immediately, there is no more dearer than him anyone." So one should take this risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, yesterday you said that Kṛṣṇa appreciates the devotee when he accepts voluntary adversity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yesterday, you said that Kṛṣṇa appreciates when a devotee accepts voluntary adversity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Like the kings who gave up everything to live an ascetic life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But how do we know what, how do we know when we should accept this adversity? Sometimes people artificially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Adversity, not always to accept. But you have to follow the regulative principle enjoined in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> That is, in one sense... Suppose you are accustomed to certain type of, standard of living, but for Kṛṣṇa's sake, you have to give it up. That kind of adversity. That is not actually adversity, but he thinks that "I have taken this voluntary..." What is this, electric? So not a single useful tree. These trees are no fruits, no flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes. Can we call these trees demonic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not demonic. Sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They have many seeds to reproduce themselves, but no fruits or flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impious, not pious. What is the name of this park?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Tuilerie Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Tuilerie Garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tuilerie.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Tuilerie Garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That is the name of a person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French devotee:</span> It was the park of a king before. There was a king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, the king is a park only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So you were explaining that they're naming everything in the material world after different people in regards to Lake Geneva. You said, "It's Geneva's lake, but actually, it is Kṛṣṇa's lake, or Kṛṣṇa's park."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but they have no sense. They think it is Geneva's park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> We could call it Puruṣottama Park, or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is nice. Therefore, we give name everyone: Kṛṣṇa dāsa, servant of Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa... (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...and we give them the argument, could you eat if we brought you the cow and let you kill her yourself, and they say, "No, I could not do that." (Prabhupāda chuckles) But yet, when the cow's meat is killed and wrapped up in a nice wrapper, they eat, and they don't have any bad feeling about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He cannot face the actual situation, but, covered by some <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he accepts. This is another example of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Directly killing the animal he cannot tolerate, but when it is covered by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the same danger, he accepts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> It is like the people: they say that the air is very polluted. We cannot breathe it now. And they will smoke cigarettes also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Chuckles) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually, our preaching work is when we show people how, by avoiding Kṛṣṇa, they actually kill themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. Suicidal. <span class="Italic">Ātma-han.</span> Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura said, <span class="Italic">jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu.</span> Knowingly, I am drinking poison. Knowingly. <span class="Italic">Jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu.</span></div>
<div class="Centered-Verse-in-purp">hari hari! bifale janama goṅāinu<br class="calibre2"/>manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā,<br class="calibre2"/>jāniyā śuniyā biṣa khāinu</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Biṣa khāinu</span> means drinking poison. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Although a devotee feels helpless in the hands of Kṛṣṇa, still, in order to execute his duty, he must be very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> How does he reconcile those two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He must work for Kṛṣṇa. He is not doing anything for himself. He's doing for Kṛṣṇa. For Kṛṣṇa's sake, one can take any kind of risk. Just like the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they take any kind of risk for earning some money similarly, <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> also will take any kind of risk to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa. Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> So it is not very clean. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Many, many people come here every day and not too many people clean. It's difficult to have people clean. They think it's too low, as an occupation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They spend their money making bombs instead of sanitation. (Prabhupāda laughs) (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Instead of taking bath every day, they use perfume on their body. Fifty years ago, very few people had a shower in the home, and they would go to a public bath once a week or twice a week for a bath. Most of the time they cleaned themselves off with alcohol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They still, in Germany, they have no bath in every house. They go to the public bath. Is it not? They, simply they have got only one toilet. That's all. And for taking bath, they go the public house. They have to pay some... [break] Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The creation of the materialism is only one-fourth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What happened to the other three-fourths?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's a Greek myth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whom he's killing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It's a man with the head of a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> ...the head of a bull. The head of a bull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Head of donkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is goat, goat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> These are called centaurs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's a man with a bull's head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Like Dakṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dakṣa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Dakṣa has a head of a goat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dakṣa. Dakṣa. Yes. Mahārāja Dakṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In order to chant the holy name purely, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is it necessary to feel separation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In order to chant the holy name purely, is it necessary to have feelings of separation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Provided he has got the taste for chanting. Otherwise he'll sleep. That's all. (pause) These are all buildings for museum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, and some small parts are used for administrative offices, the government and police. This used to be a king's palace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> This used to be the king's palace, of France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, this was the palace before they built the big palace in Versailles. Versailles is like a demigod's planet. It's the most wonderful building in all of France. Everything in gold, and wonderful paintings. Very, very big, and wonderful gardens and rivers. The king of France was very intelligent. In order to keep the nobles from revolting against him, he invited them all to his palace to enjoy with him. And he gave them wonderful feasts and a lot of sex life, and wonderful music. And like this, they never revolted during his time. This was Louis the Fourteenth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> He was called the sun king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They call him the saintly king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> Sun, sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, the sun king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that sun king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Why do they call him "Sun King"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> Because he was very opulent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Today, the French people collect millions of dollars every year from the Americans to keep Versailles beautiful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> American tourists pay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, many hundreds and thousands of American tourists come there every year just to see this opulence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The Americans appreciate opulence. That's why we joined your movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Chuckles) Yes. <span class="Italic">Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ sukṛtino 'rjuna.</span> So because in your previous life, you had been pious, you have got your life in America, and now utilize it. Certainly, I, several times I have told that your previous life, you were pious. There is no doubt about it. And now utilize that opportunity. You have got opulence. You have got money. You have got intelligence. Utilize it for Kṛṣṇa. Then it is successful. And Kṛṣṇa has also come. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has come to your country. So utilize it properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> I think we must be extraordinarily fortunate that Lord Kṛṣṇa, He appears once in a day of Brahmā, and He appeared just five thousand years ago. And then Lord Caitanya just appeared five hundred years ago, and we have an opportunity to associate with Them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Always remember this grace of Lord and utilize it. (long pause) So these houses were constructed before Napoleon, or after Napoleon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Oui. Oui.</span> These big house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> Before Napoleon. But this arch is called Carousel Arch, and that's for Napoleon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After Napoleon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">French Devotee:</span> On the glories of some victories in Germany, you know and... (end)</div>
