This is Kali-yuga. <span class="Italic">Anardhena naya-rahitam.</span> [break] What people mean by religion? [break] ...not serious. Nobody is serious about religion. So what do they think about religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They think it is a nice thing so that the people will work hard and not create any trouble. [break]</div>

They create: "Let me create something. After all, it is bluffing. So if I can..." Just like this, from India there are so many come. Here also there are many. They create some. It is...
