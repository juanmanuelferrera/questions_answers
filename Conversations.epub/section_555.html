<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car) They have not gone to the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is far, far away. Their calculation is wrong. They are going to a wrong planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It must be the Rahu planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, or something else. Not moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> How many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is above the sun planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Moon planet is further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh. Because they say that the moon planet is the closest planet to the earth. That is their calculation. And they say that it orbits around the earth, and then that the earth orbits the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All wrong. What is the... According to them, what is the distance of sun planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Sun planet is 93,000,000 miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> They say the moon planet is only 250,000 miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is wrong thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Is their calculation for the distance of the sun wrong also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> 93,000,000? It says in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> exactly what the distance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole universe, diameter, is <span class="Italic">pañcaśat-koṭi-yojana.</span> One <span class="Italic">yojana</span> equal to eight miles, and one <span class="Italic">koti</span> is ten miles, er, ten million. So <span class="Italic">pañcaśata,</span> fifty into 10,000,000 into eight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah. So it's fifty <span class="Italic">crores yojana.</span> Fifty <span class="Italic">crores yojanas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, fifty <span class="Italic">crore yojanas, pañcaśat.</span> So one <span class="Italic">yojana</span> equal to eight miles, one <span class="Italic">crore</span> equal to ten million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's eighty million.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Eighty million times fifty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Means 400,000,000</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Hmm. More than that. Four billion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Four thousand million, which is four billion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Four billion miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Four billion miles is the diameter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is the diameter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> You gave that in <span class="Italic">The Teachings of Lord Caitanya</span> also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the sun is in the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So two billion miles from the edge of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And they say? 93,000,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That's from the earth to the sun. That's not from the sun to the edge. That's from earth to the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Is earth near the edge of the universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There are many other planets down. Seven planetary system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The higher planetary systems are closest to the sun? And then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, sun is the middle. This is circumference. Sun is the middle. And the whole diameter is fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and... What is...? And moon is above, 200,000 <span class="Italic">yojanas</span> above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">200,000</span> yojanas. That means 1,600,000 miles above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Above the sun. How they'll go? (laughter) They are going to the wrong..., bluffing only. I am repeatedly saying, they have never gone, simply bluff. How it is that they brought some dust? So brilliant, it is blazing, full. There is fire blazing. (walking:)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say that they measured the moon and that it's very small compared to the earth, very tiny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If it's a longer distance than the sun but still it appears so big in the sky, it must be a very large planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Similarly Venus and others, they are also above.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, above the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sun is moving near about that. This is one universe, and there are thousands and millions of universe. <span class="Italic">Jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi. Yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is God's creation. And they are becoming God, "I am God." <span class="Italic">Yasyaika-niśvasita-kālam athāvalambya [Bs. </span>5.48]<span class="Italic">.</span> If we simply think of the creation of God, we can appreciate how great He is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That's why it's described in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, "God is great," but they do not know how great He is. That is explained in the Vedic literature. Of course, those who are saying "God is great," they are pious. And those who are saying that "I am God," how foolish they are. Therefore I say that anyone who says, "I am God," immediately kick with your shoes on his face. Such a cheater.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There is... One of the disciples of Guru Maharaj-ji, Bala Yogesvara, is in Perth. They have their center here. And he is giving lectures daily, and many people are attending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There was an article in the paper yesterday from India that says that the Indian court has banned Guru Maharaj-ji from leaving India. They have issued an order that he must stay until the court has finished because his brother is suing. Because his brother published a photo showing Guru Maharaj-ji embracing and kissing an American girl in the paper. So the Guru Maharaj-ji published a picture of his brother doing the same thing. But they say it was a fake photo, so the court is holding him in India, and they're having a legal battle, suing each other to see who is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Farce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> It seems like these demons who say that they are God, eventually they will end up destroying each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now they are fools, rascal, bluffing, but even the scientists, they are also bluffing. Now Russia and America combined together, going? Just see where they are going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Here's one article about scientists in the paper. It says, "Wonder food will help control heart disease." They say they have a new way of feeding beef and poultry so that the food now, when they eat the beef, it won't give them heart attack.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say if they feed them a special diet they have found it changes the cholesterol level in the beef, so if they eat it, they won't get heart attack like they used to. And it says, "The director of the National Heart Foundation, Ralph Reeder, said he believed the process was one of the most significant contributions in recent years toward controlling heart disease. 'It should not be taken lightly by skeptics. It is a world's first,' he said."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Now they are also thinking that different types of meat cause cancer, not only heart disease but cancer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> What have the scientists got to gain by bluffing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Position. Material world means they want some material gain, some adoration, and some fame. That's all. This is material world. So if by bluffing you I get some material profit and adoration and fame, why shall I not do it? Everyone is doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That's the cheating propensity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In material world they have come to imitate God-adoration, fame, material profit. Just like this man. He has come to this country. He is getting money, he is getting woman, and becoming God amongst the fools. He is satisfied. That's all. This is not gain? If I get woman, money, and adoration, is it not gain for me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> Yes, just like Hiraṇyakaśipu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Materialistic man means he wants all these things in different way. Somebody is becoming God, somebody is becoming philosopher, somebody is becoming scientist, in this way. Real purpose is these three things. <span class="Italic">Abha-pūjā-pratiṣṭhā.</span> And our philosophy? We don't want anything of this. Just see. Negation. <span class="Italic">Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ kavitāṁ</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Say... All denial, "We don't want." That is Vaiṣṇavism. Then what do you want? "We want simply to serve Kṛṣṇa." This is our position. They don't want to serve Kṛṣṇa; they want to imitate Kṛṣṇa. And that is their satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, many times when I am seeing professors or students also, they seem to think that traditional Hinduism or whatever they think it is, they say that the Māyāvādī philosophy, or monist, they think this is traditional, and..., because there's so many translations of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> they've read, and they're all impersonal. So I was wondering what is the best way to convince them that actually, that is not actually the original tradition of understanding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they are becoming foolish, that they are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and they are accepting original tradition of the Māyāvāda? In the original tradition of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is said, Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān:</span> "I said. I am person." How these rascals are accepting imperson? Why do they read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> If they have got different theory, let them differently... They are cheating. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is popular. Therefore they are taking advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and pushing on impersonalism. But here the tradition begins, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ.</span> Where is imperson? So if they want to be cheated willingly, who can save them? They are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and devīating from the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Then what is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They don't know. They simply...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are so rascal, that... You are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You must take the words of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Why you are taking other words? What business you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They think by majority, most people think like this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Majority or minority, it doesn't matter. But why you should take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to establish your rascal theories? That means you are cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But they think that's the meaning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's the meaning how?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That's what they think. They think because they've read so many commentaries...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do they think? If I have written one book, my words are my meaning. Why you should give meaning? I shall kick on your face. What right you have got? You write another book. Why should you take my book and give your meaning? What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> These professors didn't write the books, but they read all these Swami this and that books' translations. And then they think, "Well, all these swamis say it's like this..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They should be conscious that if you read one book, you must understand what the author says. Why should you bring something else to understand that book? What is this? If you want to say something else, you write your own book or bring that book. Why you should take my book? If you want to smoke <span class="Italic">ganja,</span> why should you take my hand? You have got your hand. You smoke <span class="Italic">ganja.</span> What is this? I take your hand and smoke <span class="Italic">ganja?</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But they say that "We need the help of these different commentaries to understand such deep philosophy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should you? Why should you? Why should you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> There are different philosophers. They have got different theories. You make your theories. But why should you make your theories on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they say they want to study the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not... If you study, you study as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They can't read Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They don't know. They think "We have to accept from these different swamis. They are the authorities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you should? If you do not know Sanskrit, why don't you learn Sanskrit, one who knows Sanskrit? What is this nonsense? I say, "Give me a glass of water," and you do not know Sanskrit, you say, "No, it is not meant for him; it is meant for me." What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But the professors aren't doing this. They want to read the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> so they're accepting these Māyāvādī philosophers' interpretations. We're speaking of the professors, not of the ones writing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> interpretations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why Māyāvāda... Interpretation is required when you cannot understand, but when the things are understood very clearly... Just like we had been in Kurukṣetra. That place is there for millions and millions of years. And why one should interpret, "Kurukṣetra means this body"? Why should we accept this meaning? Kurukṣetra is already there. Everyone is going. And if somebody interprets, "No, Kurukṣetra means this body," so why I shall be so foolish to accept this interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, people say that they're not sure whether it's a symbolic meaning or an actual meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your conjecture. But when you read book you should understand the wording of the book. You cannot conjecture in such...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Because they say some of the Vedic literatures...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means willingly they want to become fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> There are so many great symbolic literatures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are seeing this green. If you interpret, "It is not green; it is white," what is this? Can you interpret like that? It is green, and "No, in my interpretation it is white. What you are seeing, it is not actual seeing." You can go on saying like that. But I am an ordinary man. Why shall I take it white? It is green. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But that is the way of great writing, to write in symbolism. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Great literary works are done in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They call it "writing between the lines." There's some hidden meaning. Therefore it is very deep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> And so if Kṛṣṇa was such a great philosopher, then naturally He would have also used those literary talents to write in between the lines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, you become very good bluffer. That's all. We don't accept you. All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they did not accept, those who are authorities. Vyāsadeva, he did not accept these foolish theories. Nārada never accepted. Recent <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Caitanya. Why shall I accept these third-class professors? Kick on their face. We have got authority to support this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> I think they want to interpret <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> because they do not want to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the idea. That is the real purpose. They want to kill Kṛṣṇa. That is the endeavor of Hiranyakasipu, Kamsa, that "We shall kill Kṛṣṇa." And ultimately they become killed. Their faith is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Their whole idea of Indian history, of Vedic history, is completely perverted. When we say five thousand years ago Vyāsadeva compiled this in writing, they say, "There was no civilization five thousand..." They said, "Only two thousand years ago there was some tribes, and they were not very moral," and things like this, all completely nonsense, because they misread the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> and things like this. And then they teach some of the students these crazy ideas. Not all of them, but I talked to some who teach like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The more you fight with these rascals, the more you advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You are a fighting soldier. Kṛṣṇa very much appreciates. (long pause) So you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by your own interpretation, and I take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. So who is right? Who will decide this? You interpret in your own way. I don't interpret. I take it as it is. Now we are two parties. So who is correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say because so many others...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there are two parties. That's all. Others means one who interprets, that is one party. And there is one party who does not interpret. So who is correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say, "We are right because we are more." They say, "We are many..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many asses means there is an opinion? Many asses give some opinion. Is that opinion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> They say so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They say we are Ph.D., and there are so many swamis and things like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> Democratic method.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Majority rules.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> The result will show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That democracy is the ruination of civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> But actually many of them appreciate the actual translation because it's so much more clear. It's just that before, they didn't read it. Many of them, now they are reading it, they appreciate it very much</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we want to remain in the minority. We don't want to be ruled by the majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually, anybody who is serious about spiritual life can accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and the others take all the other spiritualists'...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Actually, these professors aren't interested in spiritual life. They're just thinking. They just think and talk, but they're not interested in spiritual life either way. They don't follow the other commentary...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They consider spiritual life as simply a department of philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, psychology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spiritual life is reality they do not understand. They take it as something mental position. (long pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> All of these gurus are being exposed. Just like Guru Maharaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Generally people don't believe it if someone says he is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The first thing is: what wonderful thing he has done, that he is God? People have no common sense. We accept Kṛṣṇa as God. There are so many wonderful things done by Kṛṣṇa. Now what has he done that we accept that he is God? He has fallen in love with his secretary; any common sweeper also becomes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> That is his <span class="Italic">līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sweeper's <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> (laughter) (long pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes if we go out to preach and we go away from the association of devotees, what can we do to make sure that we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go at least two. Don't go alone. That is the system. When you go to preach, you must go at least two. If possible, more than two. Don't go alone. That is not the system. (pause) This Guru Mahārāja (Guru Maharaj-ji) cannot go back to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> No, he cannot leave India. He went to India to struggle with his brother and mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So now it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Now the court says, "You cannot leave India until we settle this." They've issued a court order not to leave India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. He can remain there. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The case is... Who is the complainer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, originally... The story is something that the father started the whole movement, and then he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was a great cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, chief cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. And his wife cheater, she wanted to carry it on and her eldest son was named God, or the leader. And..., but she thought that this Guru Maharaj-ji was better, more appealing to the people. So she changed and said, "He can be the leader." Then he started the Western movement. And then he began... She noticed that he was becoming playboy instead of God. And so she began the trouble in India, and she claimed that he was no longer suitable because he was eating meat and intoxication and becoming a playboy, all these things. Dancing. So she started the trouble in India, and she wants to reinstate the elder brother as the leader and take away the younger one, Guru Maharaj-ji. So that's how the trouble started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that her business may go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all she tried the youngest son. When he is failure, now replace him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Actually, he was a good investment. She made a lot of money on the younger son, probably more than she would have on this older one. Because the older one is not so attractive. He's kind of ugly. This younger one is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Attractive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yeah, kind of cute. Everyone thought he was cute. (laughter) Young, fat...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> So now he has gone to India to try to win the battle, and in the course he has been sued, and the court order says he must stay until the suit is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> When the movement first came out to Australia about three or four years ago, one of his disciples who was a girl, she came through Perth, and at that time I was arguing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> with her, but she could not understand. She could not see that it was Kṛṣṇa to surrender to and not Guru Maharaj-ji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Whenever we place a good argument with them, they say, "Yes, but all these words are just words, and actually it is beyond words. The truth is beyond words. So never mind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are talking words. You are not beyond.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Then they should not talk anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Please stop your talking because you are not beyond, you are talking also like me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say that the Absolute Truth is beyond words. That way we don't have to explain anything about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we don't say beyond words. You say. But you are talking, therefore you cannot speak about Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, they don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They only talk nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> They don't like to argue about the Absolute Truth. They'll only talk nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are holding meetings? Big, big meeting arrangements, why do you make?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, they hold the meeting and they say, "You come to us and take knowledge," that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is word, that is word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But they say it's something else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are using words, canvassing. Why do you say beyond words? The word is helping you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, they say, "The actual knowledge is beyond words. You come and take knowledge from us and you will see that it's beyond words."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The beginning is words. So where is the absolute knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say, "That you have to take from us." If you ask them to describe it, they say, "No, no, you have to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not... Better hate to talk with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Better to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, don't talk with them. So lower-grade men they are, it is useless to talk with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "God is detained by the word of court." He has no power to defy the words of court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> The judge will judge him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes. He will probably bribe the judge. That will be the real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is possible. Everything is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Because he is so rich he can pay the judge a few million rupees, and the judge will say, "Yes, yes, he is God." By court's rule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the other party will go to appeal. Where he is being judged, in the Supreme Court or lower court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I'm not sure. Actually, the judgment is whether or not he put a false picture in the newspaper of his brother with a girl. The older brother is claiming that... First he put a picture in the paper showing the younger Guru Maharaj-ji kissing an American girl. So Guru Maharaj-ji put another counter-photo showing his older brother with an American girl. So the suit is over whether this second picture is a real picture or is it artificially made. That's what the court will decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is the suit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in other words, the case is that God cannot kiss an American girl. (laughs) Is that the case? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, not in public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> The mother's claim is that the Guru Maharaj-ji is not fit to be the leader now because he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he has kissed one American girl?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, not one, but many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> It's his character in general has degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> That was the initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> She says he has fallen down and this is evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> God has fallen down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means kissing one American girl is falldown. Is that the case?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why it is falldown? Kṛṣṇa, He kissed so many <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> He can defend like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He may do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do that. He is the same Kṛṣṇa. Now, formerly Kṛṣṇa used to kiss cowherd girls. And He is kissing American girls. Where is the wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> But this was in public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa also do in public.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But he cannot do anything like lift Goverdhana Hill or have sixteen thousand wives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is both for them. Let them lift only one mound weight. Then they will come. But they cannot do, neither of them. That is impossible. They have not killed any demons. They are taking advantage of the foolishness of some people. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The only quality they have exhibited is expertness in cheating. That is their qualification. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> (in car) Because so many of them are saying that "I am God," they become envious of one another, and then they fight and expose each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Competition. God's competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes. And then everyone can see that they are simply materialists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only he, but there are many others claim to become God. All of them should be brought into the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Didn't Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura do that once?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> What was the penalty that he...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He put into the jail for six months. And he died in the jail. He took poison. Because after coming out of the jail, he could not do his business. He's finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gaṇeśa:</span> Also Paundraka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa cut his head immediately. Let this Guru Mahārāja cut the heads of the opposition, that "You do not accept me God, I cut your head." Let him cut the head of his brother or mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> (laughing) He may do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we can understand he is God. Why does he go to the mercy of court? And the court has detained him. What kind of God...? So can you get charcoal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Charcoal, yes</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, get it. (end)</div>
