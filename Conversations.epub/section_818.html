<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...means <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> The more we get material possession, our false egotism increases. "I have got this. I have got this. Who is more powerful than me?" <span class="Italic">Āḍhyo 'bhijanavān asmi ko 'nyo 'sti sadṛśo mayā.</span> These are described in the Sixteenth Chapter. What is the meaning of this <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra</span>? Because <span class="Italic">vimūḍhātmā,</span> that "I have got this motorcar. I have got this property," but within a second it can be finished. There is another, superior law. That he forgets. He sees actually, but he forgets. That is called <span class="Italic">vimūḍhātmā.</span> He is seeing, everyone. Of course, our time and nature's time, little different. So many Hitlers, so many Napoleons, so many Gandhis, so many Jawaharlal came and went. But they do not see. <span class="Italic">Paśyann api na paśyati.</span> They are seeing actually; still they do not see. Blind. In India the Mohammedans came. They ruled over. Where is the Moghul? The Englishmen came. Where they are? Everything gone. <span class="Italic">Paśyann api na paśyati.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">vimūḍhātmā.</span> That is going on. The material civilization means <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> By false egotism they are bewildered and rascals. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura has translated this, that <span class="Italic">jaḍā-bidyā jato, māyāra vaibhava:</span> "All this material advancement of civilization is the paraphernalia of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" Because you cannot enjoy it, but you are thinking, "I possess so much. I possess so much." You'll not be allowed to enjoy, but still.... Therefore all these material possessions are the paraphernalia of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So what is the wrong there? Now, wrong is this, <span class="Italic">jaḍā-bidyā jato, māyāra vaibhava, tomāra bhajane bādhā.</span> They are hindrances for advancement of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the aim of human life. That, you forget that. So <span class="Italic">tomāra bhajane bādhā, anitya saṁsāre, moha janamiyā.</span> The result is that he becomes more attached to this temporary world and remains the rascal. Because without being rascal, nobody comes in this material world to enjoy. As soon as anyone has come to this material world, he's a rascal. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare, nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? In some parts of the Bible it describes how things were being carried out, and they say that the activities were going on according to the will of God. Does that mean that there was a God conscious civilization then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Activities? These activities are going on. The sun is rising by the will of God; the moon is rising, will of God. You are being punished by the will of God. He is the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But they described that people were worshiping and that children were being born...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Children were being born according to God's will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> It's described in certain parts of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Children will be born.... If you are.... If the child is sinful, then it will go to the womb of a mother who will kill him. That's all. By the will. By the.... That he should be punished. One who has used contraceptive and abortion method, by the will of God he will enter another mother, and the mother will kill him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But the <span class="Italic">Bible,</span> it indicates...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, now, you see, try, understand. You are very good Bible quoter, but try to understand each and everything. Simply you go on quoting, but understand what is that quotation. It is by the will of God. You have committed sinful life by contraceptive method. Now you enter in the womb of another mother and be killed. That is <span class="Italic">Bible.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> So what is described there was not actually God consciousness or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is God consciousness if you understand it, that "I am now being punished by the will of God. I have done sinful activities." That is God conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> God gives what everyone wants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> If they desire that, they get that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>You wanted this punishment; therefore you get it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> People are thinking that the punishment is something worse than this, that "This is very nice. We can live here and be happy, and the punishment is in hell."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Here we live happily."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That.... No, no. That is the nature of the living being, that he is happy by nature because he is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> So <span class="Italic">ānanda</span> is nature, but he is finding, trying to find out nature in sinful life. Therefore he is being punished. That he does not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> So that's his ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is ignorance. His nature is to become happy. He is happy, happy. Just like our natural position is we are healthy. Nature has made this body. But we create such situation that we become ill, sick. And at that time we see, "Oh, I am..." What is that? "I am infected. I have been contaminated." Go to the doctor, injection. But the natural life is no disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you create a situation; therefore become diseased.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Otherwise it wouldn't be called "diseased," because it would be normal to be sick. But disease means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Normal life means no sickness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And as soon as there is sickness, that means punishment. So if you want to be punished, then violate the hygienic laws. You can see that there is hospital and medical treatment and medicine-for whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sick people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, for the human society. Not for the birds, beasts. But they follow nature's law. But this rascal violates nature's law and suffers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> What about for the devotees, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Sometimes they are very sick, have so many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devotees.... To become devotee is not so cheap thing. You don't think that because you have got a <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> you have become devotee. Why do you think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, <span class="Italic">eiṭa eka kalira chelā, nāke tilaka, galaya mālā:(?) </span>"Here is another follower of Kali. He has got <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and <span class="Italic">mālā.</span>" <span class="Italic">Sahaja bhajana kacen māmu, saṅga laiyā pārera wala (?):</span> "He is worshiping, <span class="Italic">bhajana,</span> taking another's wife." <span class="Italic">Sahaja bhajana kacen māmu, saṅga laiyā pārera wala, ei ṭa eka kalira chelā:</span> "Here is a servant of Kali. Simply he has changed his dress with <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and <span class="Italic">mālā.</span>" Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says. If you take <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and <span class="Italic">mālā</span> and do all nonsense things, then you are not a devotee. You are <span class="Italic">Kali-chelā.</span> To become a devotee is not so easy thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Devotee means perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Certainly. Devotee means <span class="Italic">sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is above these material laws. That is devotee. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.</span> He is in the Brahman stage. That is devotee. If you take.... That means <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span> "Because I have got a <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and <span class="Italic">mālā,</span> I have become devotee." This kind of cheating will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And in this modern age, this cheating is very prominent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Modern or old, anyone who is a conditioned soul, he has got cheating propensity, four defects. One of them is the cheating propensity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. But the mental stage in this age is very strong, mental. They think mentally they have found a solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> But they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within mind you can think, "I have become emperor of the world." That you can do. Who can check you? But that is not the actual fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is the characteristic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is mental concoction. Within mind you can think, "I have become the proprietor of the banks, all the banks." Madman that is. He's a madman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They have so many philosophies, but it's all mental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All mental. We say, therefore, don't say "philosophy." We say "mental speculation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Philosophy means <span class="Italic">tattva-darśinaḥ.</span> That is described, <span class="Italic">tattva-darśinaḥ.</span> One has seen the truth, he is philosopher. And who is hovering in the mental concoction platform, he's a rascal. "I think." This is.... Their all European philosophy is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> "I believe."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I believe," "In my opinion." He's a rascal, and he is giving his opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Prabhupāda, are the laws of <span class="Italic">karma</span> written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Laws of <span class="Italic">karma</span> is you touch fire, your finger will be burned. This is laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> You cannot avoid it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They are so complicated, though. Are they actually written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another.... This is the law of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> If you do something which is forbidden, then you suffer. This is laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Or you enjoy. Both good and bad. That is laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Either you take the result good or the bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> To a devotee it is very clear, the laws of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> He sees how that God, Kṛṣṇa, is just.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Devotee means <span class="Italic">tattva-darśī.</span> He has seen the real truth. Devotee means who follows Kṛṣṇa. So Kṛṣṇa is giving the real truth. If you take, then you are devotee. If you don't take, you are nondevotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the role of mercy if one takes or doesn't take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mercy means.... Suppose you are a devotee. Unknowingly or by some bad habit you have done something wrong. That is excused. But if you intentionally do, that "I am devotee; Kṛṣṇa will excuse me," then you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the greatest offense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Cheating. Cheating Kṛṣṇa. Cheating Kṛṣṇa is no business. That is to be punished. You cannot cheat Kṛṣṇa. But if by accident, knowingly or unknowingly you have done something which is not good, that is excused. <span class="Italic">Sva-pāda-mūlaṁ bhajataḥ priyasya.</span> If you are actually, because you have given so much service to Kṛṣṇa, you have become very dear to Him, so unknowingly you have done, committed sin-excused. <span class="Italic">Bhajataḥ priyasya.</span> This word is used. You must have to become very dear to Him. Then if you accidentally commit some sin, that is excused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> What does "unknowingly" mean, Śrīla...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unknowingly means..., suppose you are a smoker. So now you have given up everything. But in the association of some smoker you incline, "All right, let me smoke." Then you regret, "Oh, I have done this." It can happen. So that is excused. But if you think, "Now I am a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. I can smoke like anything, and everything will be excused," then you are a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we are knowing that we are so sinful and we're so rascals, but having the opportunity of association of pure devotee and Kṛṣṇa, that's also mercy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because we can see that we are..., our hearts are not clean, and we are constantly thinking of <span class="Italic">māyā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education, education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is mercy. This is greatest mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you are being educated. Not that cent percent mark you are getting, but because you are trying to be educated, so that is also good. That is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee(1):</span> Therefore the association is most important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, very important, so that if I commit some mistake, I'll regret: "Oh, my other associate, he is not coming to act in that..." That chance he'll get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So we pay a little attention to Kṛṣṇa, but Kṛṣṇa gives us a lot of attention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you give.... If you go forward, Kṛṣṇa, one step, He comes forward ten steps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He runs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is His mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I just read on one of the pages of that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> where you said in a purport that Kṛṣṇa desires that we go back home a lot more strongly than we desire to go back home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Therefore He comes. He is very anxious to take back His sons, back to home, back.... Just like father. If he sees, "My son is suffering there, leaving home," he tries to get him back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Unfortunately we don't even desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore you are madness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the materialists will say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Therefore you have come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, that if God is, if He is actually wanting us to go back, then why is He causing suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If He wants us to come to back home to Godhead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, you rascal, you are suffering. He says, "Come back." You don't go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because He has given you freedom and this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says, "My dear boy, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]" But you don't do. You must suffer. It is your creation, suffering. You must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say, "If He is all-loving, why is He...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Loving, but.... You are.... I love you. I say, "Do this." If you don't do it, then...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's reciprocal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> So the suffering is His mercy also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suffering means he'll be purified. Suffering is the process of purification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And part of His laws.... It's within His laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have infected some disease. You suffer. Then the enviousness(?) of Kṛṣṇa will go away by suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> So the pure devotee is <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So this question of freedom of <span class="Italic">jīva</span> and control of Kṛṣṇa, that there is freedom but at the same time there is no freedom, is a very fine line between the two that sometimes we do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why don't you understand? Just like you belong to a free nation, the American. Does it mean you are free to do anything and everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> With your limited freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> There's a fine line between this freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you say, "I belong to this free nation," then yes, you are free. But that does not mean that you can do anything and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take that example of the habit, if someone is smoking out of habit. So again. So is he free in that smoking, or is it..., has he completely surrendered his freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.... These things are very common. Just like in your country the government has written on the cigarette box, "It is harmful to health." But if you still smoke at your risk, do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So freedom.... You can smoke, but you cannot avoid suffering from the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, from the result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> You have to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> This is the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And you cannot smoke outside the laws. You cannot smoke a cigarette...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is.... Already warning is there that "You smoke; you suffer." And if you still do that, suffer. What can be done? Common thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The freedom is always there, minute independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Minute.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Freedom with responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Just like they say that you have the freedom to yell "There's a fire" in a theater, but you don't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many examples are there. Freedom is there, but you are not absolutely free to do whatever you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Because of the stringent laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are small. Just like children. He has got freedom, playing. But when he is doing something wrong, father, "You don't do this. Don't do this. Don't do this." But if he does it, even he is children, even he's child, he'll suffer. He cannot say, "I am child. I did not know, father." Then that does not matter. You must suffer. You must suffer, even though you are child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And, Śrīla Prabhupāda....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Father takes care, "My dear child, don't do this. Don't touch fire." But still, he touches; he must suffer. The fire will not excuse because he is child. That is not possible. Nature's law will act.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This idea of freedom and independence, is it possible for anyone theoretically to surrender to Kṛṣṇa at any time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So let's say someone is in a very degraded condition of life, modes of ignorance, passion. Their mind is always disturbed. Is surrender to Kṛṣṇa.... Is it possible that it can be independent even of the mind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, let's say someone's mind is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are independent of mind always. It is your mind. You are not mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are independent of mind always.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So even a person merged in the mode of ignorance can by some good fortune surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No good fortune. God, Kṛṣṇa, says, "You do it"; you do it. Here immediately you become fortunate. There is no question of waiting for becoming fortunate. You become fortunate immediately. Suppose if I say, "Take this bag, 100,000 dollars." You can take it. Immediately you become rich man. Why don't you take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> How does <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddhi</span> work, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛpā-siddhi.</span> How does that work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛpā-siddhi</span> means that you are not willing take this bag. I say, "Take it, take it, take it." (laughter) "No." That is <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddhi.</span> Even you are unwilling, I give you in your pocket, push it. That is <span class="Italic">kṛpā-siddhi.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should not wait for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yadubara:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Individual's freedom, when he is ignorant, it is not really freedom because it's completely under the control...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when he gets the money, and he spends it, and he sees, "My poverty is gone," then he becomes thankful. "Oh, it is so merciful that he has given me this thing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The individual freedom, when he is in the mode of ignorance, is completely under the laws of material nature. When the individual makes spiritual advancement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Individual freedom means.... We should always know our freedom is limited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Limited. Yes. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are not.... Because the Absolute, so how you can..., your freedom can be absolute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> So the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> thinks.... His freedom is limited to thinking "Am I going to eat this meat rare or well done?" That is the sort of freedom he is getting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Completely ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a thief. He also has got the conscience, "Why shall I steal?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> "This or this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "This or this." But he knows that "If I do it, I shall be punished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. But when an individual spirit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that actual freedom, though? Is that freedom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have already said that you cannot have absolute freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but is the spirit soul implicated in that decision in any way, or is it just the modes of nature working, "Well, I'll take this instead of that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is the spirit soul implicated in that decision, or is it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that decision?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let's say, "I'll go to the cinema, or I'll go to the restaurant." So is the spirit soul implicated in that decision in any way, or is it simply the three modes of material nature working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The three modes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow what is your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a situation. Either I'll go to the cinema or I'll go to the restaurant. So is the spirit soul...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both of them are sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So how is the spirit soul involved in it? Is the spirit soul choosing, or is the decision already made by his <span class="Italic">karma</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma, karma...</span> You can make your <span class="Italic">kar...</span> You are doing that. <span class="Italic">Karma</span> you are creating every moment by desire. <span class="Italic">Karma</span> is.... What is that? Thinking, feeling, willing. You think of something; then you do it. That means you create your <span class="Italic">karma.</span> You are thinking that "I shall go to the cinema"; then you go. That is <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The question is choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is desire. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means you shall not desire anything except to serve Kṛṣṇa. Then you are safe. Because you are desiring so many things for your sense gratification, you are becoming implicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes. So the point is that if a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a good child. He has decided, "I shall do only what my father says." Then he is safe. And as soon as he misuses his indep..., little independence, he is complicated. So decide like that, that "I shall not do anything which is not ordered by Kṛṣṇa." Then it is all right. Otherwise you'll suffer. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Make it zero. Then you are safe. <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply do, act, what Kṛṣṇa says; then you are safe. Why don't you do that? That is also independence. You are misusing independence. You are misusing. Then you must suffer. The government says, "Do according to the law." Then you are safe. Government will give all protection. And if you violate law, you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So take it that there is a man, Śrīla Prabhupāda, who is not very learned in <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> but he only simply does what his guru tells him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is learned? What is learned? A child, does he require learning. When the father says, "You do it," does it require any university education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "He is my father." That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Nara-priya</span>(?) do not know <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> They know unalloyed devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is the nature. A child generally abides by the order of the parent. They are playing. The parent says, "Don't do it! Sit down!" Immediately sit down. That is the nature. So why don't you break your nature, that "My duty is to carry out the order of the supreme father?" Then you are safe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And when you carry out that order-you fully surrender-then you enjoy full freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is full freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is the freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is absolute freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Full freedom means to be under the order of the Supreme. That is full freedom. That is full freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The cinema or restaurant is not freedom. It's completely conditioning under the laws of material nature. But fully surrendered soul is fully free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if you simply, even if you want to go to a cinema...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's still responsible for going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you ask, "Father, I wish to see cinema," if father says, "All right, we'll go," that is not sinful. But you go in your own whims-that is sinful. <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Sometimes it's difficult as devotees for us to know whether we're doing the right thing or whether we're just speculating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore you have to consult your guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> It's because we are not surrendered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> But even in small things, just day-to-day activities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no small thing. Everything big thing for a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> I've discovered, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the way to do that, of course, is to read your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> By reading your books, then all of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the books are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Even practical, everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> But without attitude of devotion, nothing will work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Attitude of devotion must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The attitude, devotion, is there. Otherwise why one should come to our camp? But it must be properly utilized. It should not be misused. If you go to school and if you don't read books, you'll fail in the examination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> But the attitude of devotion should be there every moment, so everything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> ...is very meaningful. Everything is a big thing. When we go out we should realize we're doing it for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is said, <span class="Italic">man-manā.</span> Think of Kṛṣṇa; He'll guide you. Very easy thing. <span class="Italic">Man-manā.</span> Always think of Kṛṣṇa, then there is no question of falling down. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> These four things, if strictly done, he is safe. He is safe. Always think of Kṛṣṇa, become His devotee, offer Him obeisances and.... <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī,</span> and worship Him. This is Deity worship. That will engage in always in thinking, in offering obeisances. And if we strictly follow only these, these four principles, <span class="Italic">mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te:</span> "You are coming back to Me without any doubt." But instead of thinking Kṛṣṇa, we are thinking something else, planning something, misusing independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhīmasena, I was speaking to him two days ago. He says that he'll turn over that temple to us. He wants to meet you, so I'm going to call him to come and see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a big talker, but I was flattering him, and I said, "If you transfer it over to..." (laughter) He said, "I'll do it when Prabhupāda comes." So I'll tell him to come and see you today and.... I told him if he transfers it over to us, then we can build better on the top. He has already built something downstairs, and we can make it a very beautiful temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll call it Bhīmasena.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He wants to become famous, so I said, "Everybody will know that you built a temple there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the location is very good. It's right in the center. And they have Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deities there, plus they have Rāma, Sītā, Lakṣmaṇa, Hanumān, which we can also worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Only problem is they have Durgā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Durgā, so we can worship, giving Durgā the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> of Rāma or Kṛṣṇa. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, something can be worked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not directly. His <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> If we can worship ordinary human being, why not Durgā? But we give <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> We shall give. So don't tell all these things now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I didn't tell him anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We do not say that we do not believe in the demigods. No, we believe in. But they are servants. That's all. We cannot make the servant and the master on the equal footing. That is all. We worship Durgā, <span class="Italic">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā [Bs. </span>5.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, what is the function? <span class="Italic">Icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā govindam ādi...</span> She is acting by the desire of the Supreme Lord, Govinda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Better than we are and should be worshiped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Better devotee than we are and should be worshiped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> As a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she's a devotee. Just like we say "<span class="Italic">prabhu.</span>" <span class="Italic">Prabhu</span> means your master. So "Because you are devotee, we accept you as master." Master means "I am ready to serve you because you are devotee. I am your servant." <span class="Italic">Dāsa-dāsa-dāsānudāsaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 13.80]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Because you are devotee, I am prepared to serve you. Otherwise not."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> Do the demigods sometimes forget their positions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are serving me? If I had been an ordinary person, why...? You would have not.... Because you accept that "You are devotee," therefore you serve. So as soon as we find a devotee, immediately serve him. <span class="Italic">Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā, nistāra pāyeche kebā.</span> Without serving a devotee, who can be elevated? It is our duty. So we can serve the devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Why is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered, "Whatever you like, you take." He said, "No, no, I don't want anything. Please engage me in the service of Your servant." He rejected everything. He simply said, <span class="Italic">nīja-dāsya-yogam:</span> "Kindly engage me in the service of Your servant." That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, Prahlāda Mahārāja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not want even direct service. "Engage me in Your service," he did not say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, "Engage me in Your servant's service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> So if we see people in the world as potential devotees, we should also serve them so they can become good devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not service. That is mercy. One who is potential devotee, to show him mercy, develop him to become a devotee, that is mercy. That is not service. Service can be rendered to the higher person. And to the lower person you can show your mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Oh, that's a good distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's said in <span class="Italic">Upadeśāmṛta</span>...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One who is lower than you, he requires your mercy. You give him mercy. And who is higher than you, you give him service. Not that Vivekananda did, that everyone service. No, service to the higher person. And to the lower person? Mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Someone asked me the other day if I knew Swami...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And equal person? Friendship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With equal, friendship. With higher, service. And with lower, mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> And envious, ignore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, ignore. Neutral: "You go to hell. We don't mind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Somebody asked me the other day if I knew Swami Vivekananda. I said "Viveka-who?" He said, "Vivekananda is very famous in the West. Do you know him?" I said, "Viveka-who? I have never heard of him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) So he was little surprised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Cyavana:</span> They made some propaganda, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That's Guru dāsa's trick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if one serves the higher devotees and shows compassion to less advanced devotees, then where is the question, say, for a position of an advanced devotee who is feeling himself to be the lowest? So is that distinction still there of higher and lower? If he is feeling himself to be the lowest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not feel lowest. He takes sympathy that "Here is a person. He can be a devotee. So let me raise him to the standard." He does not think that he is lowest. Devotee always thinks that he is lower than the worm. But it is the duty. It is the duty. It does not mean that he is thinking, "I am higher." No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> That's again mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, he doesn't consider that he's advanced and that therefore he is showing mercy to lower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. He is always thinking, "I am lower than the worm, but Lord Kṛṣṇa wants, so let me do some service. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> That is our occupation, to show mercy to others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> And amongst devotees, Godbrothers, an advanced devotee is one who sees that "Everybody is serving Kṛṣṇa so nicely..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> "...so let me assist them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> "Let me facilitate their service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore we say <span class="Italic">prabhu.</span> <span class="Italic">Prabhu</span> means "You are my master. Please order me. What can I do for you?" That should be the attitude. [break] ..."Guru dāsa Prabhu, please come here and brush my shoes." (laughter) What kind of <span class="Italic">prabhu</span>? He should say, "Guru dāsa Prabhu<span class="Italic">,</span> can I brush your shoes?" That is real Vaiṣṇava, not that "Guru dāsa Prabhu<span class="Italic">,</span> come here and brush my shoes." Other devotees, they do not come for morning class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For the walk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not for walk. At least we shall hold morning class or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes, Prabhupāda, please. A few devotees are staying at the hotel here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is a program tonight if you'd rather.... There is a program this evening, going out, the Rotary Club. So if you would rather just give class this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, regularly we hold morning class anywhere. So.... So that morning class is not going to be held here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the temple we have it. They had it this morning, but.... (end)</div>
