<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It is called <span class="Italic">Mahāprabhu sādhana.</span> It is on record that that is the house where Caitanya Mahaprabhu spent <span class="Italic">catur-masya.</span> [break] Yes, he arranged to have these programs for us. There were almost ten thousand people there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is good potency in South India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Oh, yes, it is very promising.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> He is secretary of our committee here and president of the Rotary Club in Nelore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your arrangement was very nice. Thank you. Hm. Where is that wrapper? These cottages are very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> [break] His father is donating for Kṛṣṇa's Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And who is donating for the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> They will.... We will comment. I will comment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Is there a path that goes down there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It's shallow. [break] ...that the Vaiṣṇavas say that the gold ring is smaller in quantity than the gold mine, but the only way in this material world.... That is only a material example, because something can be separated from the general mass because there are many different elements. You can tell the difference between a gold ring and a gold mine because there is air and space. But there is <span class="Italic">ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti,</span> there is only Brahman, so you cannot say that there is a big Brahman and a part-and-parcel Brahman. The words "part and parcel" you have only written into the <span class="Italic">śrutis</span> for your own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not your rascal's imagination. It is spoken by the Lord Himself. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśaḥ.</span> He is not rascal like you, that He will say something which is mistaken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, that is only during His <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> He says that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. He says like that; we have to accept it. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In the lower stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lower stage not.... That is.... You are in the lower stage. You cannot understand. But what He says, that is right. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśaḥ, sanātana,</span> "eternally <span class="Italic">amara.</span>" It is not that made <span class="Italic">aṁśa</span> at the present time. <span class="Italic">Sanātana.</span> From.... From the very beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then it is contradictory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No contradictory. It is not contradictory. He says, <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> that "These <span class="Italic">jīvas,</span> they are eternally My <span class="Italic">aṁśa.</span>" It is not that because now in the material world it has become fragmented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How can there be any truth outside the Lord?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How can there be any truth separate from the Lord, like a gold ring separate from the mine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but whatever the Lord says, that is truth. Not your statement is truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, just like if I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...you should dress warmly. You should dress warmly now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> And then I come in the summer, and you still are dressing warmly-it's for time and circumstance, only immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is spiritual fragment, eternally existing. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetana...</span> There are always plural number and singular number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How can there be any truth separate from the Lord? <span class="Italic">Eka brahma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not separate. You are thinking separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> No, a gold ring is separate from the gold mine. That is your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that is your material conception. But everything is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, that is a material example. The example came from you Vaiṣṇavas. We do not make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We go directly from the <span class="Italic">śruti, ekaṁ brahma dvitīyaṁ nāsti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you don't accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There cannot be anything in between.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you don't accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We also accept. During <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> these things may go on, but actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Ultimately everything will become one. The <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> will become one with the Paramātmā. The <span class="Italic">Advaitavādī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already one. That is <span class="Italic">Viśiṣṭādvaitavāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes, but it appears differently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But actually there is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So we are one with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So we are one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why one? You are one and different, <span class="Italic">bhedābheda, acintya-bhedābheda-tattva,</span> simultaneously one and different. Just like this. This is one and different. The children have come from the body-that is one-but still, they are different. Even in the hogs and pigs the <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda-tattva</span> is there. [break] The word should be <span class="Italic">nābheda sanātana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] It is different only during the manifestation of <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> but actually it is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in Vṛndāvana. They are one, but still, there are trees, there are flowers, there are water, there are calves, there are cows, there are <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> but they are all one. <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> All of them are <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-rasa. Nirviśeṣavādīs...,</span> it is not <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣavāda. Sa-viśeṣa.</span> What is this? [break] Just see, it is already "Hare Kṛṣṇa," known.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Foundation was laid in December '74, but no work has been done since then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not let us have this land? We can develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very nice land, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right by the lake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It already has our name. If the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is in the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span>-that's <span class="Italic">itihāsa</span>-how did it get the name <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad, Gītopaniṣad</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Itihāsa</span> also Vedic literature. <span class="Italic">Pañcama-veda, Mahābhārata,</span> for understanding of the common man. <span class="Italic">Strī-śūdra-dvija-bandhūnāṁ trayi na śruti-gocarāḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>1.4.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Woman, <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and <span class="Italic">dvija-bandhu,</span> they cannot understand directly the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> But even Bhisma, when he was on the battlefield, he said, "I have given up my <span class="Italic">bheda-jña,</span>" so he became one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One you are already. Because you are foolish, you cannot understand. That is <span class="Italic">abheda.</span> I am not different. Just like my finger is not different from me. If the finger thinks, "I am different from the body," that is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Just as we say that ignorance consists of not understanding the difference between the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> and the Paramātmā, the <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs</span> say that ignorance means to understand the difference between <span class="Italic">jīva</span> and Paramātmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then they difference. They admit that there is difference, if they say like that, that "There is difference."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> But they say that oneness, that is the real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That's all right. But why they say "different"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They say to see that our vision of difference, that our vision of difference, that is ignorance. When we understand the <span class="Italic">jīvātmā</span> to be different from God, from Bhagavān, that is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> That your vision of seeing God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So we admit that, that when we see that "I am separate from..." Then the same example: If the finger thinks that it is separate from the body, that is ignorance, because the finger is required by the body to serve the body. So if he thinks, "No, I'll not serve you because I am different," that is ignorance. That is ignorance. That is going on. These <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> they refuse to serve God. That is ignorance. If they are part and parcel of God or one with God, how you can refuse to serve? That is ignorant. Here the finger is my part and parcel of the body. It cannot refuse to serve. I say; immediately it comes. So if the finger thinks that "I am one. Why shall I serve the whole body?" that is ignorance. <span class="Italic">Cetana. Cetana</span> means activity. So if I am one with God, then my activities should be simultaneously with God. That is oneness. I don't disagree. God says, "You do it." I disagree. God says, "You surrender unto Me," but I refuse. That is ignorance. If I am actually one with God, just I am asking, "You do this"-you do immediately. But if you do not do it, that is ignorance. <span class="Italic">Gurur avajñā.</span> Then he becomes <span class="Italic">aparādhī.</span> Similarly, oneness means no disagreement. That is oneness, <span class="Italic">cetana. Cetana</span> means I can disagree or agree. Two things are there. That is <span class="Italic">cetana.</span> So <span class="Italic">cetana, cetanaś cetanānaṁ.</span> So when God says that "You do it," you must do it. That is agreement. That is oneness. If you refuse, that is ignorance. How can you refuse? Suppose you.... Take the whole family, and the head of the families asks somebody to do something. If he refuses, then that is rebellious condition. In the state the citizen must agree with the government. <span class="Italic">Cetana. Cetana</span> means he has got both the things. If he likes, he can agree; if he likes, he does not agree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vasughoṣa:</span> So their big word is that you merge and you become that. So how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is merging. They do not know what is merging. Merging means "I, so long I was disagreeing; now I agree to abide by Your..." That is merging. Just like several states they merge into one. So they agree to work unitedly. That is merging. Merging does not mean that you have got your discretion and that is finished. That is not merging. Then your <span class="Italic">cetana</span> is lost. How it can be lost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> What about the analogy that many rivers flow into the same sea and lose their individuality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> Their example is that many rivers, they flow into one sea, and then they lose their individuality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are short-sighted, blind, that there are many individual living entities within the river. But they are blind. They cannot see them. Because it is covered by water they see only the water is there. Because they are blind rascals, they cannot see. But if they go deep into the water they will see there are so many individuals, millions, and they are living in the same river.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there's no difference between the individual living entity and the total...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there is no difference. Still, that is.... That is <span class="Italic">acintya-bheda...</span> That is individuality and no individuality. So long they are living there within the river, there is no individuality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That example is also a jugglery of words because the.... Let's say the Mississippi River is the quantity of water that's on the land. When it goes into the ocean you don't say that "Now the Mississippi River is in the ocean." Mississippi River is still individual, and the ocean is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Mississippi is not finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> And the water molecules...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And not only that, the water is again taken away and it is thrown into the Mississippi. So these rascals who think that "We have now merged. We are now liberated," that is rascaldom. They will be taken away and thrown again. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa...</span> No, this is fact. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> They cannot stay. They will be taken away by the nature's law, converted into cloud and thrown away, again come, again come. They are thrown away. They cannot stay. And again they become water and come through. That is going on, coming and going. So their merging is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> <span class="Italic">Vimukta-māninaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">vimukta-māninaḥ,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padam.</span> That claims Viṣṇu as the Supreme, but where does it say that Viṣṇu..., I mean Kṛṣṇa, is the source of Viṣṇu from the <span class="Italic">śrutis</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti...</span> Brahmā said, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> is <span class="Italic">śruti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Brahmā spoke <span class="Italic">śruti, Vedas,</span> so whatever he speaks is <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> It is therefore called <span class="Italic">saṁhitā. Saṁhitā</span> means <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> As soon as it is called <span class="Italic">saṁhitā,</span> that is <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] ...comprises the examination for <span class="Italic">bhaktivedanta</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-śāstrī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> There was talk that they would be given examinations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> What is the syllabus for...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever books we have got, it should be studied. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-śāstrī</span> means <span class="Italic">Nectar of Devotion,</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">Nectar of Instruction,</span> <span class="Italic">Beyond Death</span>-in this way we select some ten books. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti-śāstrī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So when will that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we come to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> then we come to <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> in this way. So from next year, unless one passes <span class="Italic">bhakti-śāstrī,</span> he cannot be second initiated. First initiation is open for everyone. "Come on. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." That will purify him. Then let him understand what is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This is very good, because then those that will become second..., those that will have second initiation will have to know the scriptures, will have to know your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is.... Now there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāmṣa:</span> And unless they know your books, they will never be fixed-up devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Many times people give second initiation because they need a <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>

But we are not going to do that. We know.... Of course, hospital required so far the body is concerned, but there are so many hospitals. The real hospital which is not existing, we are starting.

What is your answer? Why you are checked on the airport just like a culprit, criminal? They cannot trust even a gentleman, although he is educated, may be holding very good office, but still, he is not to be trusted. So this is the result of your so-called function, that there is no honest man throughout the whole world. Then, what is the use of such education? And what is the use of their living? Let them die. No hospital for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> A man in Calcutta, he was a devotee, rich also. He had some kidney thing. He wanted to go to the Calcutta hospital. They said, "All the beds are full of Naxalites with bomb wounds and stab wounds and fighting wounds."</div>
