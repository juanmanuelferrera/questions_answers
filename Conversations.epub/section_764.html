<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is idea. <span class="Italic">Mano-rathena,</span> by mental speculation, <span class="Italic">asato dhavato,</span> they will come to materialism. As soon as they will hover over mental concoction, they will remain in the material pool, because mind is subtle form of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Also, in their evidences by which they base their dialectic discussions, have they regarded the Vedic scriptures? They have avoided them very conveniently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no question of dialectic discussion. Suppose I am discussing, you are discussing something, but if I am imperfect, you are imperfect, what is the value of such discussion? That is the point. The party discussing something, whether he is perfect? If he is not perfect, then go on discussing. We first of all say that any conditioned soul is defective, and that is admitted. They say, "We are not perfect." "I think," they say. "In my opinion," they say. Never they say, the so-called scientists, "definite." And they cannot say it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahamsa:</span> That is like Dr. Frog's philosophy when they speculate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply speculation. So that kind of discussion, what is the value?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's always a hypothesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If some children discuss some serious subject matter, what is the value? And they are all children in the cradle of nature, that's all. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriya</span>.... Therefore it is word, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like children-"Ha! Sit down here"-he has to sit down. Then where is his freedom to discuss? <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> says that "You sit down here. Don't go there." He has to accept. Then what is the value of discussion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Mainly, these Karl Marx, they were angry at the Christian church for exploiting the poor masses, and that's the reason...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> ...so he has attacked. He has taken vengeance on this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they are doing. Still they are doing. Just like you said, some sprinkling water. They have no philosophy and they violate everything, what is stated there in Bible. Now you say that "Thou shall not kill;" they say, "Thou shall not murder." They are molding. Now this homosex they are sanctioning, man-to-man marriage. They are sanctioning abortion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. Two homosexuals were married by a priest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now they have a church where the priests are homosexuals and the attending people are homosexual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now they have churches for homosex. That means the priest is a homosexual, and the persons who come are homosexuals. A special church for homosexuals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Is that religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> The simple fact that the Christians have to sprinkle water to convert means that they do not have any potency to by philosophy, to preach to them with strong philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no.... So, go on reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> I'll backspace two sentences.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] "...have allowed us to wither away these different countries, and the religionists, they are keeping all the food. They are not distributing it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> If we say that the Russia has no grains, they will say that they are big wheat producers in the southern part. They may counteract by saying, "We also produce..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They had to purchase wheat from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukeśa:</span> Russia is importing its food grains now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they cannot produce sufficient, such a big country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukeśa:</span> And Eastern Europe, which is also communist, gets all its supplies from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is their explanation. Russia is the biggest country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukeśa:</span> Land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The reason was that there was no rain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then you have to depend on rain, and when we say, <span class="Italic">parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ...</span> Hm? And <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> That means, rascal, you take one side, that <span class="Italic">ardha-kukuti-nyāya.</span> Cut the chicken half, and separate the mouth-it is expensive-and keep the rear side. You get eggs. (laughter) So this is <span class="Italic">ardha-kukuṭi-nyāya.</span> The rascal does not know that if you separate the mouth there will be no egg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukeśa:</span> They say that's depending upon nature. But they do not know who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The word <span class="Italic">nature</span> should be condemned. That.... No scientific-minded person can say the word <span class="Italic">nature.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they do not know what is nature. Nature is an instrument, and there must be an operator. So that they do not know, the operator. Just like a child is thinking the motorcar is going automatically. He does not know there is a driver. The child sees that the airplane is flying. They think it is automatically going. And there is a pilot, he does not know. Similarly, these rascals, they are studying nature, but nature is an instrument only. It is being operated by Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> They have practical experience that without operator a machine cannot work. In the huge machine, how it is working unless there is operator? That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukeśa:</span> That's what they never trying to find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhaḥ nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Mūḍha.</span> Therefore they are all <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> So we are not going to be misled by the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> That is not possible. We take the instruction of the topmost intelligent person, Kṛṣṇa. I think our Svarūpa Dāmodara has said that. Where is that book? He has given: "Kṛṣṇa, the topmost scientist." Yes. "Perceiving the supreme scientist, Śrī Kṛṣṇa." He has given this article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How do we know that Vedavyāsa is not defective like other living beings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> How do we know that Vedavyasa is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not defective because he is speaking what he has heard from Nārada. Therefore he is not defective. Just like we are speaking. We are not perfect. We are also ordinary human being, but people are taking that "Bhaktivedanta Swami has done wonder." What is that wonder? I am speaking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Like the Mormon religion in America...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, don't bring any other.... That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> He claimed that an angel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you accept.... We are taking from God. Kṛṣṇa instructed Brahmā, Brahmā instructed Nārada, Nārada instructed Vyāsadeva, and therefore we are taking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So it is a novel. Like Shakespeare wrote Hamlet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It may be novel for you because we take you as a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> We don't give any credit. We say.... Find out this, <span class="Italic">mūdho nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have this, <span class="Italic">mūḍho 'yam nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya<br class="calibre2"/>yoga-māyā-samāvṛtaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mūḍho 'yam nābhijānāti<br class="calibre2"/>loko mām ajam avyayam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.25]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the fools. He does not know Kṛṣṇa; therefore he is fool. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency, <span class="Italic">yogamāyā,</span> and so the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahamsa:</span> So who is fool is defined as <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritaḥ [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahamsa:</span> Who is a fool, that is defined in the other verse, <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Mānuṣīṁ tanum āśri...</span> That one who considers Kṛṣṇa as ordinary human being, he is <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> So read the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "It may be argued that since Kṛṣṇa was present on this earth and was visible by everyone, then why isn't He manifest to everyone now? But actually, He was not manifest to everyone. When Kṛṣṇa was present there were only a few people who could understand Him to be the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the assembly of Kurus, when Śiśupāla spoke against Kṛṣṇa being elected president of the assembly, Bhīṣma supported Him and proclaimed Him to be the Supreme God. Similarly, the Pāṇḍavas and a few others..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sisupala could not see, although Kṛṣṇa was present there, but Bhisma could see. So you require special eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ...</span> [Bs. 5.38]. So unless you are qualified, how you can see Kṛṣṇa? This is the point. Kṛṣṇa is there, and the rascal Śiśupāla could not see Him, but Bhisma could see Him. So they say, "Can you show me God?" Even God comes before you, unless you have got the qualified eyes you cannot see Him. Therefore qualification required. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita.</span> When your eyes will be annointed with, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Salve of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Ointment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Salve of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Ointment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Savoth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Salve, salve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the spelling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Salve, s-a-l-v-e.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, salve of love, yes. So that is required. Your.... Therefore <span class="Italic">tat-paratvena nirmalam.</span> You have to make your senses purified; then <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> will begin. Otherwise it is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> If your senses are not purified, then it is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> There is a difference between <span class="Italic">karma</span> and.... <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita...</span> What is that? <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you think yourself that "I am American," "I am Indian," "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" "I am this," "I am that," then you are not <span class="Italic">upādhi-mukta;</span> therefore you cannot see Kṛṣṇa. You can see Kṛṣṇa when you are no more within these <span class="Italic">upādhis,</span> pure soul. Brahma.... That is real <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> to understand the position of the soul and engage the soul in the service of the Lord. Then it is perfect. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Similarly, the Pāṇḍavas and a few others knew that He was the Supreme, but not everyone. He was not revealed to the nondevotees and the common men. Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa says that but for His pure devotees, all men consider Him to be like themselves. He was manifest only to His devotees as the reservoir of all pleasure. But to others, to unintelligent nondevotees, He was covered by His eternal potency. In the prayers of Kunti in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.8.18), it is said that the Lord is covered by the curtain of <span class="Italic">yogamāyā,</span> and thus ordinary people cannot understand Him. Kuntī prays: 'Oh my Lord, You are the maintainer of the entire universe, and devotional service to You is the highest religious principle. Therefore I pray that You will also maintain me. Your transcendental form is covered by the <span class="Italic">yoga-māyā.</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti</span> is the covering of the internal potency. May You kindly remove this glowing effulgence that impedes my seeing Your <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> Your eternal form of bliss and knowledge.' This <span class="Italic">yogamāyā</span> curtain is also mentioned in the Fifteenth Chapter of the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> The Supreme Personality of Godhead in His transcendental form of bliss and knowledge is covered by the eternal potency of <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti,</span> and the less intelligent impersonalists cannot see the Supreme on this account. Also in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (10.14.7) there is this prayer by Brahmā: 'O Supreme Personality of Godhead, O Supersoul, O master of all mystery, who can calculate Your potency and pastimes in this world? You are always expanding Your eternal potency, and therefore no one can understand You. Learned scientists and learned scholars can examine the atomic constitution of the material world or even the planets, but still they are unable to calculate Your energy and potency, although You are present before them.' The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Kṛṣṇa, is not only unborn, but He is <span class="Italic">avyaya,</span> inexhaustible. His eternal form is bliss and knowledge, and His energies are all inexhaustible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, go and discuss. (end)</div>
