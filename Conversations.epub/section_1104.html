<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span>? When there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mithyaiṣa vyavasāyas te prakṛtis tvāṁ niyokṣyati.</span> The <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> drags you down in that world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he was trained up as a fighter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our, one of the mission is to reestablish the division of the society according to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But, sir, even without redividing them, nature has divided it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, nature has divided, but we are taking the post or some position without qualification. That must be rectified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That, what you say, that we should not have come in possession of the power in government, is a fact. They have no that quality of governing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What can be done? There is no <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They... You see, they govern for themselves, and not for people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If they are there, they are not well-off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are. Just like we are creating these <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> all over the world; not many, but some of them. There is at least one ideal class. But the modern society, they do not want <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> neither anybody interested to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is animal society. You cannot ask a dog, "Please come here. I shall train you as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>." (laughter) That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Our mixing with the Western type of society...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Western, Eastern, we don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We have actually imbibed their spirit of special, I mean, arrangement or management. Otherwise, up to the other day, we were well-classified. After doing that fifty or hundred years, perhaps, we have lost our real mooring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It is necessary that in the society all classes of men must be there. Then it will be in order, on order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The classes are complementary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The highest evolved man, the brain trust of the country, has got to be poor and has to be protected by other men. That is the highest. Otherwise, if a man with the brain becomes rascal, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Miscreant. They are called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛti.</span> They have got merit, but engaged in sinful activities. That is called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛti.</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛti</span> means meritorious. But <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> There are now... The education is there, but their brain is misused. That is called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> Therefore they do not believe in God. Big, big men, they are <span class="Italic">nirākāra-vādī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This co-education is no education at all. Education, that was really imparted by (indistinct) and ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education... This is craftsmanship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I had an appointment to speak on education in the university of Bombay as a member of the Senate. And all the members of the Senate simply said, "Well, we could not help it because it has been so planned by the government." That is not ... This is not education that we're giving them. We are just giving them instruction how to read and write. The real education is the education of the mind by which you can discriminate what is right from the wrong and follow the right. That is what for the education. Modern universities are humbugness to me... The way I observed the university of Bombay working for ten years as a member of the Senate is humbug. The curricular is humbug; management is humbug; everything. Mode of examination is also like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they are not conducted by really educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The education that has been actually put in practice in India by MacCauley was just to prepare people to run their institutions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Girirāja? Can you call him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said, Girirāja, that there is some declaration by Vinoda Bhave that "I'm now going to retire."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who? Vinobari.(?) (Vinoda Bhave?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Completely. And now I shall endeavor for <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span>." So that means till now he was not on the liberation platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> He is... Vinoda Bhave is real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He is truly a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes I know that. That may be. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> is <span class="Italic">sattva-guṇa.</span> That may be, but that does not mean liberation. There is knowledge. At least he understands what is liberation and what is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Knowledge put in practice is <span class="Italic">vijñāna. Jñāna vijñāna saha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if he's trying for becoming liberated, it is understood that he was not liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He must have been disillusioned by all this. He has really done work in this way that anybody would be disillusioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, our point is that if you are not liberated, how you can become leader? That is cheating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is the (indistinct). The political, socio-political... I don't know the sort of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our point is that if you do not get knowledge from liberated person, that knowledge is useless. That is cheating. [break] It is very easy. Just like a child. If he takes your direction, he liberated, and if he acts according to his childish nature, then he's conditioned. If you take Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then you are liberated. If you manufacture your own idea, then you are conditioned. Two things. Child is not actually liberated. He is child. But because he takes blindly the direction of the father, he's liberated. That is <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante. </span>Anyone who has surrendered to Kṛṣṇa and strictly follows what Kṛṣṇa says, then he is liberated. Otherwise not. If he manufactures idea, then he's conditioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is what? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and it is very easy: "Henceforward I shall simply follow what Kṛṣṇa says." That's all. You become liberated immediately. It is one minute's task, simply to decide that "No more my concoction, my imagination." Then he is liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But this decision, all these things is done by the mind which has got all the <span class="Italic">vartmas</span> of the past births.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind may be, but if I ask the mind that "You cannot do anything except what Kṛṣṇa says," then you are liberated. Very easy. You see? We are doing the same thing. We are not liberated. I am not liberated. But I am presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. That's all. That's my doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean <span class="Italic">sve sve karmaṇy abhirataḥ saṁsiddhiṁ labhate naraḥ.</span> That is your duty you have. That is what ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that verse is very important. That <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> As soon as you become fully surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, you are liberated, not that liberated means one has to grow four hands and eight legs. No. Simply you have to change the consciousness, that "Henceforward I shall act only as directed by Kṛṣṇa." That's all. You are liberated. It is one minute....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How do you get that direction moment by moment, hour by hour?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By His representative, by His words, they are present. Where is the difficulty to get His direction? <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who has seen, one who has understood Kṛṣṇa, take direction from him. "He's my representative." <span class="Italic">Yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **.</span> If you get right guru, then you are liberated. If you follow the direction, if you want to please him, <span class="Italic">yasya prasādād bhagavat-prasādaḥ **,</span> then you are liberated. Otherwise, what is the meaning of this? <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante.</span> There is no need of waiting for liberation. "As soon as one surrenders to Me, he is immediately above the platform of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So what was the Vinoda Bhave's statement published in the paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That he's not going to give any more public lectures and he's not going to give any more advice to any institutions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But, now he's thinking that it is useless. Otherwise why he would say like that? And <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span>? He's going to try for <span class="Italic">mokṣa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He's saying that by reducing these activities he wants to get <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, our point is that if he was not on the platform of <span class="Italic">mokṣa,</span> liberation, why did he waste his time by spoiling himself and for spoiling others? Now he has come to his senses, it is good, but it is to be understood that he simply spoiled his time and spoiled others' career by misleading them. Thus, without being liberated, nobody can guide anyone. That is useless. That is <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you have no eyes, then how can you lead others? If you are blind and they are blind, then what is the use of becoming their leaders? Actually all the so-called leaders and scholars, they are blind themselves and they have become big, big leader. That is the misfortune of the present life. And, therefore, our proposition is you take direction from Kṛṣṇa and His representative. That's all. That will help you. Try to understand this point. Our system, <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system, is that I am just like disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī. I don't say that I am liberated. I am conditioned. But because I am following the instruction of Bhaktisiddhānta, I'm liberated. This is the distinction between conditioned and liberated. When one is under the direction of a liberated person... The same thing: Electricity. The copper is not electricity, but when it is charged with electricity, if it is touched, that is electricity. And, similarly, this <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system, the electricity is going. If you cut the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system, then there is no electricity. Therefore it is stressed so much. <span class="Italic">Sa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> The electricity is lost. These people, they do not know. Now at the fag end of life, they are thinking, if intelligent person, that "What I have done actually?" If one has sense, he should come to this understanding. By cutting some, what is that? Dead trees? The civil disobedience began by cutting dead trees. Is it not? Vinoda Bhave, he began his leadership forty years ago by cutting... Gandhi also, civil disobedience. So this kind of leadership might have been little enthusiasm for the time being, but actually what people gain by that, such leadership?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Anta-kāle 'pi brahma-nirānanda.</span> He thinks that way, that in last moment he is, come to that stage, he will be ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good, but we should know also that so long, whatever he has done, that is from the blind platform, so nobody has gained anything. And if it was on the real platform, then <span class="Italic">svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> So <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti</span> is such nice thing that even a little... There are many places it is confirmed that even a person in <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti</span> stage falls down, being immature, what is the loss there? <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata...</span> What is the loss there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is no loss, since Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">śucīnāṁ śrīmatāṁ gehe yoga-bhraṣṭo 'bhijāyate [Bg. </span>6.41]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is the... If <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti,</span> a little done... And what does he gain? If he does not take <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti</span> and does a duty, what does he gain? <span class="Italic">Abhajatāṁ svadharmataḥ. Abhajatāṁ svadharmataḥ.</span> He is strictly following his occupational duty, but he's not a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> What does he gain? <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer</span> [SB 1.5.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> Can anyone quote this verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is your... <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you do your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning. That is the beginning. That is also <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> But <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means he must be conscious that "Kṛṣṇa is my Lord. I have to serve Him." That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If he is not conscious, how can he do work for Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the beginning. Then it becomes purified more and more and more and more by service. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau</span> [<span class="Italic">Brs</span>. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he realizes his position. <span class="Italic">Svayam eva sphuraty...</span> The more he advances in <span class="Italic">sevonmukha,</span> by service, God becomes revealed to him. And then <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam.</span> Then as he becomes more confidential, then he is imparted <span class="Italic">buddhi-yogam,</span> means <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> What is that <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga? Yena mām upayānti te.</span> "That <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> by which he can come back to Me." Not that <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> means you remain here in this rotten place. <span class="Italic">Yena mām upayānti te. Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam, buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> He can receive that <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga.</span> What is that <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga</span>? <span class="Italic">Yena mām upayānti.</span> So this is required. This is the ultimate goal of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But that <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga</span> which we have left undone in the previous birth, God with His mercy gives you that <span class="Italic">buddhi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yoga</span> continues, continues. If it is unfinished... Unless that <span class="Italic">buddhi-yoga</span> is complete, one is not allowed. One is not allowed. He remains within this material world, very opulent position. Position like Indra, Candra, Brahmā. They are devotees, but not pure devotees. They have got some tinge of material enjoyment. Therefore they are given big, big post. One has become Brahmā, one has become the king of heaven; one has become the king of moon planet, sun planet. They are not ordinary living being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Ananya...</span> They are not <span class="Italic">ananya-bhaktas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They had some tinge that "By <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> I shall enjoy this material world." And <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> I have not at all, <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana. Niṣkiñcanasya bhagavad-bhajanonmukhasya.</span> They don't care for this Brahmā's post or Indra's post or... They don't care.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-cāriṇī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. <span class="Italic">Kaivalyaṁ narakāyate.</span> For a devotee, this <span class="Italic">kaivalya-sukha</span> of the Māyāvādī, impersonalist...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Just like <span class="Italic">naraka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is the hell for them. What is this nonsense? Who will understand this? Huh? <span class="Italic">Kaivalyaṁ narakāyate.</span> And heaven, <span class="Italic">tridaśa-pūrākāśa-puṣpāyate.</span> Heavenly planets, they are will of the wisp. Phantasmagoria. <span class="Italic">Kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūrākāśa-puṣpāyate durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī. Karmī, jñānī...</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānī</span> wants <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> and <span class="Italic">karmī</span> wants heavenly happiness. And the yogi, yogi wants to control the senses. So he says that "Yes, we know the senses are very powerful." <span class="Italic">Durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī. Indriya,</span> it is just like snake. If you play with a snake you do not know at any moment death is there by biting. So although these <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> are like snakes, <span class="Italic">kāla-sarpa,</span> venomous serpent, but <span class="Italic">protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate.</span> We have... What is called? Extricated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Extracted</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Extracted the fangs. The fangs if they are taken away, it may do like useless. Similarly, for a devotee the <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> are dangerous. But because devotee, <span class="Italic">hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa.</span> they have engaged their <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> in the service of the Lord, the fangs are taken out. <span class="Italic">Durdāntendriya-kāla-sarpa-paṭalī protkhāta-daṁṣṭrāyate viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate.</span> The whole universe for them is very happy.

What is this? <span class="Italic">Kīṭāyate.</span> It is just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bug.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, just like ordinary insects. He is also living entity. He is enjoying in his own capacity, he's enjoying. <span class="Italic">Vidhi-mahendrādiś ca kīṭāyate yat-kāruṇya-kaṭākṣa-vaibhava-vatāṁ taṁ gauram eva stumaḥ.</span> "It happens so by the little fragmental mercy of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

A little mercy will render all this. So what he will do now that he has not said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He just said that "I will not follow religion in the traditional sense."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means another condition. From frying pan to the fire. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Dharmena hīna paśubhiḥ samaḥ.</span> As soon as you give up religious principles, you are no better than animal. That means he will manufacture. The same disease. "I'll not follow the traditional." This is their death block. That they always think that "I am independent. I can manufacture my way. I can become happy in that way." They're always thinking like that. And in a meeting with hundreds of men claps, that he is his liberated. "Now it is approved." Who is approving? That is criticized by <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> This.

Big animal. <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ.</span> These ordinary persons, they are <span class="Italic">paśu</span> and they are applauding.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Camels, asses...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? <span class="Italic">Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.</span></div>

Only disqualification is that they do not accept God as Supreme and His instruction is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He may be accepting God as Supreme, but not (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their imagination. God is canvassing, "Yes, I am here." <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Why don't you think that I am the Supreme?" But these rascals will never believe it. And still they'll write <span class="Italic">Gītā-pravacana.</span> Very dangerous. <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is spoken by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some portion. He wanted to prove himself that he is Puruṣottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's not Puruṣottama. He does not say that. Puruṣottama is really reality in true sense and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But his disciples say he is more than Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Disciples..., disciples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means why he has created such nonsense? If the disciples say something wrong, then that means he is also wrong. These people will never say that "Our Guru Mahārāja is more than Kṛṣṇa." They are not so nonsense. They will say "My Guru Mahārāja is servant of Kṛṣṇa and I am his servant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has said Puruṣottama is <span class="Italic">svarūpa.</span> It cannot be a... Anything which is infinite cannot be grasped by finite senses. That's what he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. But disciples say that Aurobindo is more than... This is their knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That means he's failed as a guru. He hasn't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He could not give them right knowledge. <span class="Italic">Phalena paricīyate.</span> The <span class="Italic">paricīya</span> is to be understood by the result. The disciple is the result. If they are so fool, then what is the guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-paramparā,</span> Vallabhācārya, the whole lot is now. I have seen it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are criticizing us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This thing is the God has to reincarnate Himself again to reestablish <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere. If you don't mind, your Swami Nārāyaṇa is also like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All of them. They are. That is why, I mean, liberation is created by God again by incarnation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They create a cheap God. Real God they reject. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Swami Nārāyaṇa said that (Sanskrit). Only to worship Kṛṣṇa. Nobody else. Unfortunately the disciples... Suppose disciples...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That the same thing. If the disciples are rascals, then what is the guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The disciple is being called guru-Kṛṣṇa again. That is what happens in all the other Vaiṣṇava. They say Vallabhācārya Mahāprabhu in place of Kṛṣṇa. That is wrong. <span class="Italic">Yathā. Yathā deve parā bhaktir yathā deve tathā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurau</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Gurau.</span> That is fact. Then you can get the real, I mean, <span class="Italic">kṛpā</span> of guru and realize God. But they're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These things happened by Vallabhācārya. That's a long history generally. They call him Mahāprabhu to make competition with real Mahāprabhu, Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vallabhācārya was disciple of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not disciple. Very admirer. But when He criticized strongly on account of his attacking Śrīdhara Svāmī...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu differs in philosophy from Vallabhācārya. He did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But they were friend, Vallabhācārya and Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So he wanted to present his (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to Caitanya Mahāprabhu, that "You'll find better than Śrīdhara Svāmī."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the highest</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He became very dissatisfied. He... Because friendly, He said that "If you don't accept <span class="Italic">svāmī,</span> then you are a <span class="Italic">veśya</span>." These words He recited, <span class="Italic">svāmī nā māne yei jana veśyāra.</span> These are there, these words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Vallabhācārya's establishment of his own family members as the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> is wrong. That is why the whole system has degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not <span class="Italic">śiṣya-paramparā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Śiṣya-paramparā</span> is the right... The same thing is happening in Swami Nārāyaṇa's. They have degraded. Because Swami Nārāyaṇa actually put his two nephews as <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> That was wrong. In South with Rāmānujācārya, they have got a <span class="Italic">śiṣya-paramparā.</span> But they have also degenerated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... Sons also may become <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> provided he's qualified. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct) the real fellow. Real. They this <span class="Italic">śiṣya-paramparā</span> in two...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śiṣyān ca putrān ca.</span> There is no difference. But not because he is <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> of such person or <span class="Italic">putra</span> of such person. Not like that. Either <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> or <span class="Italic">putra</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The <span class="Italic">guru-śiṣya</span> is as good as <span class="Italic">putra.</span> More than a <span class="Italic">putra.</span> To a real guru the <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> is more than a <span class="Italic">putra</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For guru there is no difference. But the real thing is qualification. That <span class="Italic">gotra,</span> our <span class="Italic">gotra,</span> that is applicable to the <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> and to the <span class="Italic">putra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is in <span class="Italic">śiṣya-paramparā</span> they have got that... Gautama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Gotra...</span> Just like <span class="Italic">gotra,</span> <span class="Italic">Kasya-gotra.(?)</span> This <span class="Italic">gotra</span> means this family, either <span class="Italic">śiṣya</span> or <span class="Italic">putra.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">Gautama-gotra,</span> there are many <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> So those who are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> it means <span class="Italic">putras</span> and those who are <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are <span class="Italic">śiṣyas.</span> But the <span class="Italic">gotra</span> is the same.
