<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (young British woman):</span> What was the meaning in that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ṭhākura,</span> they belong to <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> class. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa...</span> According to Vedic conception, there are four divisions: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So next to <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So this <span class="Italic">Ṭhākura</span> title is given to the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> administrator class. Yes. (pause, Prabhupāda chants <span class="Italic">japa</span> softly) So in your library you are keeping our books? No. All books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (young British man):</span> Well, not all of them. We don't have room to keep all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (pause) So you have known something about our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have also known?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I came as a Christian, not knowing anything. I still don't know really anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our movement is to revive God consciousness. Just like a man is sleeping, and he has got some engagement, say, in the morning, at six o'clock. But still he's sleeping. So somebody is trying to awake him. "Get up, get up! You have got this engagement. You have..." Our movement is like that. The human society is sleeping. So we are just trying to awake them: "Get up. Get up. You have got this engagement." That is our business. It is not our manufactured business, but it is stated in the Vedic literature, <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭha jāgratā prāpta-varān nibodhata.</span> "Now you be awakened." "Now" means "You have got this human form of life. You can now be awakened." In animal form of life there is no possibility. Therefore, in the human form of life, one should be awakened to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or God consciousness. And if he sleeps, then he loses his business. This is our mission, to awaken him. And when a man sleeps, how he can awaken him? Simply by vibration of sound. The sleeping man can be awakened simply by this process, allowing the sound to enter the ear. By no other process. He's sleeping. If you show him a stick, "If you don't get up, I shall strike you," that will not be effective. Because sleeping. If you say... So many things... There are other senses. There will be no action. But only through the ear, if you cry, "Please get up! Please get up! Now your time," that will act. So our process is that, to force him to hear. Then he'll be awakened, by hearing. Therefore Vedic literature is called <span class="Italic">śruti. Śruti</span> means it has to be received by hearing. You may be uneducated. It doesn't matter. If you simply hear from the right source, you get right knowledge. There is no need of education. Simply by hearing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> You teach your children, don't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, all my disciples, they're taught.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I didn't mean disciples. I meant children, little ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. We have got children's school also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They understand, do they not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will understand. Because hearing is there. Everyone, even a child, after hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he claps, he dances, he joins. That is practical. We have seen. Small child, say, four, five months old, on the lap of the mother, he's also moving, clapping. So this, this is also yoga system, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> So it is so practical that even a small child can take part in it, without any advanced knowledge. Universal. Universal. Even dogs sometimes, they take part. We have got practical experience. They don't like to leave us. Yes, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I have too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They like this chanting and dancing. So we are, our business is to awake the sleeping man. Sleeping man means when you sleep you have no knowledge. If somebody kills you, you cannot protect yourself. Sleeping, that is sleeping stage, that we do not know what is happening. That is called sleeping stage. Even if you are so-called awakened, if you do not know the value of life, that is sleeping stage. That is sleeping stage. So in that sleeping stage, we are trying to awake the human society. A man, a human being, may be materially very qualified, but he does not know what is the value of human life, he's sleeping. He's sleeping. Can you distinguish...? You are all educationists. What is the difference between a human being and an animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Higher intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Higher intelligence, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that higher intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Speech and ability to compute what you hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that, dog can also do. If you train dog that "If somebody, outsider comes, you bark," he'll do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> The consciousness is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so... Real intelligence is that to know "what I am." "I do not want to suffer. Why suffering in this world is imposed upon me?" This is intelligence. Take, for example, nobody wants to die. Why death is forced upon him? Nobody wants to die. If there is now news immediately, "Now this house will collapse," immediately we shall fly away. Because we don't want to die. If we understand that this house is going to be bombed immediately, we'll immediately leave. If there is earthquake... So many things. So nobody wants to die. But death is sure. So what solution they have made? I do not want to die, and death is forced upon me. So what solution we have made. What is, what is the scientists have done in this connection? Psychologically, if I do not want to die, then I must find out some way that death will not bother me. That is intelligence. You are talking of intelligence. Therefore I am explaining what is intelligence. Intelligence means "I do not want something, but it is being forced upon me. How to check it?" That is intelligence. Actually, the whole world is going on, we do not want to suffer. But suffering is there. Three kinds of suffering. One kind of suffering is called pertaining to the body and mind. I don't want to be diseased, but there is, all of a sudden, there is disease. Diarrhea. I don't want it, but it is imposed. This is suffering. Due to the body. Some discrepancies. Mind... Body's sound, but mind is not sound. Mind is "Oh, I don't feel today very nice." You see. This is one kind of suffering. Another suffering: other living creature gives you some pains. There are so many. Some of your friends, he turns to become your enemy. He puts you in difficulty. Or there are so many animals, so many insects. They give us trouble. This is one kind of suffering. Another kind of suffering: by nature's... All of sudden, there is drought. Now, just like, all, in India there is drought. They are suffering. No rain. All of a sudden there is earthquake. That is also suffering. There is some epidemic, pestilence. You cannot check it. So in this way, either of these three, sufferings going on. But those who are sleeping, they cannot understand that this is suffering. Just like animals. They cannot understand. That is sleeping stage. And when one is awakened, he will think "I don't want all these sufferings. Why they are imposed upon me? How I can avoid?" That is intelligence. So human being, unless he comes to this platform of intelligence, he is animal. The animal cannot do any remedy. You take one animal to the slaughterhouse. He cannot do anything. So sleeping means to remain in ignorance. And awakened stage means in knowledge. So intelligence means one must have knowledge. That is intelligence. So this division<span class="Italic">-brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra-</span>means the highest intelligent class man is called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> He knows. He's in knowledge. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Next intelligent, less, is the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Next, the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> And the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they are like, almost like animals. They have no independence. Just like animal has no independence. A dog, without a master, he cannot live. His life is very precarious. So at the present moment, however one qualified may be, unless he gets a good job, he's just like a dog, a street dog. He may be very highly qualified, technologically, but if he does not get a job, then he's useless. He'll go. "Sir, can you give me any job?" "No vacancies." A dog like. Just like dog goes, moves the tail, "Can you give me some food." Somebody gives him, "Eh! Hut!" This is the position. Therefore in this age <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> In <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> There are some <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> And all <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> Because they cannot live without being engaged by somebody else. And the whole civilization is going on, big, big factories, big, big... What is that? <span class="Italic">Śūdras.</span> They are creating <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> "People should be dependent." Unless you work... Therefore people are going fifty miles away, going... I have seen in New York. People are coming from the other side... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Connecticut</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Staten Island?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Staten Island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Crossing by ferry, one hour. Then waiting for bus, another hour. Then going to the office. Then after office, they're coming back. Again going. Whole day, they're dependent on everything. That is the condition in New York. It is to be supposed: the most advanced city. The same thing is everywhere. People are becoming dependent, <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> just like dogs. A dog, unless he gets a nice master, he's not happy. So at the present moment, all the population, just like the cats and dogs, they're dependent. They are not intelligent. Intelligence means he must be independent. That is intelligence. And people are struggling for independence. That is their motive. Everyone is struggling hard for independence. Because that is the culmination of intelligence. So our problem is that we do not know what we are. Neither we know how to get out of the miserable condition of life. Therefore we have no intelligence. We are like cats and dogs. This is the conclusion. What do you think? Am I right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I couldn't follow you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I haven't followed you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is your opinion, my description of intelligence and not, no intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I think you're right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But you know, my thoughts must be really not worth very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we can give intelligence by which he can become independent. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How can we in a money-orientated world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> How can we become intelligent or independent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> In a money-orientated world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, money you can get. That money does not mean independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are, while working, they're getting money, but they're not independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, I understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So without money, if you become independent, that is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> That was her question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That, if you can get Kṛṣṇa, you'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But how do you, what I mean is how do you, how can you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "how to," that we shall teach, as we are teaching others. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated,</div>
<div class="Verse">yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yasmin sthito na duḥkhena<br class="calibre2"/>guruṇāpi vicālyate<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.20-23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Yaṁ labdhvā. You get something, which getting, you will be satisfied: "I don't want anything more." That is highest gain. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ. Cāparam.</span> Another kind of benefit is not required. So <span class="Italic">yasmin sthitaḥ.</span> If we remain in that position, then even there is hardest difficulty of life, he'll not be disturbed. (pause) Where is Paṇḍitjī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'll get him. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Should I put on the light, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sit down. (pause) He gets such thing, when he gets it, he'll consider that he doesn't want anything more. That is the greatest profit. And the result is that when one gets that thing, even he is in the greatest difficulty of life, he's not disturbed.</div>
<div class="Verse">yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yasmin sthito na duḥkhena<br class="calibre2"/>guruṇāpi vicālyate<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.20-23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Hm. Take that. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Yaṁ labdhvā, yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> I think it is in the Sixth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Yaṁ nam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Labdhvā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">cāparaṁ lābham?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Six-twenty-two.</div>
<div class="Verse">yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yasmin sthito na duḥkhena<br class="calibre2"/>guruṇāpi vicālyate</div>
<div class="Verse">taṁ vidyād duḥkha-saṁyoga-<br class="calibre2"/>viyogaṁ yoga-saṁjñikam<br class="calibre2"/> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.20-23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Established thus, one never departs from the truth, and upon gaining this, he thinks there is no greater gain. Being situated in such a position, one is never shaken, even in the midst of greatest difficulty. This, indeed, is actual freedom from all miseries arising from material contact."</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purport.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "By practice of yoga, one becomes gradually detached from material concepts. This is the primary characteristic of the yoga principle. And after this, one becomes situated in trance, or <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> which means that the yogi realizes the Supersoul through transcendental mind and intelligence, without any of the misgivings of identifying the self with the Superself. Yoga practice is more or less based on the principles of the <span class="Italic">Patañjali</span> system. Some unauthorized commentators try to identify the individual soul with the Supersoul, and the monists think this to be liberation, but they do not understand the real purpose of the <span class="Italic">Patañjali</span> system of yoga. There is an acceptance of transcendental pleasure in the <span class="Italic">Patañjali</span> system, but the monists do not accept this transcendental pleasure out of fear of jeopardizing the theory of oneness. The duality of knowledge and knower is not accepted by the non-dualists, but in this verse transcendental pleasure, realized through transcendental senses, is accepted, and this is corroborated by the <span class="Italic">Patañjali Muni,</span> the famous exponent of the yoga system. The great sage declared in his <span class="Italic">Yoga-sūtras: puruṣārtha-śūnyānāṁ guṇānāṁ pratiprasavaḥ kaivalyaṁ svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti.</span>" This <span class="Italic">citi-śakti, </span>or internal potency, is transcendental. <span class="Italic">Puruṣārtha </span>means material religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and, at the end, the attempt to become one with the Supreme. This "oneness with the Supreme" is called <span class="Italic">kaivalyam </span>by<span class="Italic"> </span>the monist. But according to Patañjali, this <span class="Italic">kaivalyam</span> is an internal, or transcendental, potency by which the living entity becomes aware of his constitutional position. In the words of Lord Caitanya, this state of affairs is called <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam</span>, or clearance of the impure mirror of the mind. This "clearance" is actually liberation, or <span class="Italic">bhava-mahādāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam. </span>The theory of <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa-</span>also preliminary-corresponds with this principle. In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam </span>this is called <span class="Italic">svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 2.10.6]<span class="Italic">. </span>The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>also confirms this situation in this verse.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">After <span class="Italic">nirvāṇa, </span>or material cessation, there is the manifestation of spiritual activities, or devotional service of the Lord, known as Kṛṣṇa consciousness. In the words of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, svarūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ: </span>this is the "real life of the living entity." <span class="Italic">Māyā</span>, or illusion, is the condition of spiritual life contaminated by material infection. Liberation from this material infection does not mean destruction of the original eternal position of the living entity. Patañjali also accepts this by his words <span class="Italic">kaivalyam svarūpa-pratiṣṭhā vā citi-śaktir iti. </span>This <span class="Italic">citi-śakti </span>or transcendental pleasure, is real life. This is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtras </span>as <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">. </span>This natural transcendental pleasure is the ultimate goal of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>and is easily achieved by execution of devotional service, or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. Bhaktiyoga </span>will be vividly described in the Seventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">In the <span class="Italic">yoga </span>system, as described in this chapter, there are two kinds of <span class="Italic">samādhi, </span>called <span class="Italic">samprajñāta-samādhi </span>and <span class="Italic">asamprajñāta-samādhi. </span>When one becomes situated in the transcendental position by various philosophical researches, it is called <span class="Italic">samprajñāta-samādhi. </span>In the <span class="Italic">asamprajñāta-samādhi </span>there is no longer any connection with mundane pleasure, for one is then transcendental to all sorts of happiness derived from the senses. When the <span class="Italic">yogī</span> is once situated in that transcendental position, he is never shaken from it. Unless the <span class="Italic">yogī</span> is able to reach this position, he is unsuccessful. Today's so-called <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice, which involves various sense pleasures, is contradictory. A <span class="Italic">yogī</span> indulging in sex and intoxication is a mockery. Even those <span class="Italic">yogīs </span>who are attracted by the <span class="Italic">siddhis </span>(perfections) in the process of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>are not perfectly situated. If the <span class="Italic">yogīs </span>are attracted by the by-products of <span class="Italic">yoga, </span>then they cannot attain the stage of perfection, as is stated in this verse. Persons, therefore, indulging in the make-show practice of gymnastic feats or <span class="Italic">siddhis </span>should know that the aim of <span class="Italic">yoga</span> is lost in that way.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">The best practice of <span class="Italic">yoga </span>in this age is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which is not baffling. A Kṛṣṇa conscious person is so happy in his occupation that he does not aspire after any other happiness. There are many impediments, especially in this age of hypocrisy, to practicing <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga, dhyāna-yoga, </span>and <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga, </span>but there is no such problem in executing <span class="Italic">karma-yoga </span>or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">As long as the material body exists, one has to meet the demands of the body, namely eating, sleeping, defending and mating. But a person who is in pure <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga </span>or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness does not arouse the senses while meeting the demands of the body. Rather, he accepts the bare necessities of life, making the best use of a bad bargain, and enjoys transcendental happiness in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. He is callous toward incidental occurrences-such as accidents, disease, scarcity and even the death of a most dear relative-but he is always alert to execute his duties in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga. </span>Accidents never deviate him from his duty. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, āgamāpāyino 'nityās tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata. </span>He endures all such incidental occurences because he knows that they come and go and do not affect his duties. In this way he achieves the highest perfection in <span class="Italic">yoga </span>practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you have got any question in this statement, you can ask.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Just, just how...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How, that you have to learn, but this is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> That is the end product.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. You learn... We have got this institution. You can come and learn how others are doing, others are learning. We have got class in the morning at seven. If you've got time, you can, you are welcome. We don't charge anything. You can come and join. There is no business. You can live with us. We don't charge anything. Or you can come and go, attend class. There is no charge. Kṛṣṇa gives us everything. Just like this house. This is two hundred thousand pounds. George Harrison has purchased it, and he has given us. Similarly, everything comes from Kṛṣṇa. None of our members go to office or factory. But we eat also, nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but if somebody didn't go to the factory, you wouldn't, would you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Somebody has to go and do the work to make the food, keep the country running.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We don't hate to work. That is not our business. If we get work, we work for Kṛṣṇa. The income comes to Kṛṣṇa. But if we don't get work, we are not bothered, that "There is no work. Where shall I eat? Where shall I sleep? Where shall I go?" No, there is no such botheration. So all the members, I think, eighty, ninety percent, they do not go to work outside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Ninety-nine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? (laughter) But they get their food and shelter and everything. Even they live with a wife, children. So we,... Kṛṣṇa gives. Not only that we are simply <span class="Italic">sannyāsī, brahmacārī.</span> There are <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> householders, husband, wife, children. They are also living. So that is not our problem. How to eat, how to sleep, that is not our problem. Our only problem is how to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. That was the question that was puzzling me. What is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have to learn. Not in a moment you can understand. Then you have to come to the schooling process. Otherwise how you can learn? In a moment? Such a big subject matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are going to solve all the problems of life. Such a nice proposal. Don't you think it requires little patience to understand how to do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It requires a little bravery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It requires bravery too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because we have got background, Kṛṣṇa, so bravery, personally we haven't got to practice. Just like a child is in the protection of an able father. He's happy. "Whatever happens, father will see." He's happy. He's confident. "My father is there; my mother is there. Who can do any harm to me?" He's confident.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> There is so much that's wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, if you depend on Kṛṣṇa, God, He'll take care of you. He says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-dharmān parityajya<br class="calibre2"/>mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.66]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham. Teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānāṁ yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there. And that you have to understand practically. (pause) You are all living in neighborhood, this village? No. You have come from distant place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So whenever you find time, you can come, or, if you like, you can live with us. We have got ample place. Girls and ladies, they live separately. Boys and gentlemen, they live separately. Those who are married, we have got apartments for householders. And gradually, we are improving, I mean to say, arranging further facilities. First of all you try to attend our class in the morning and inquire all about your doubts. Have some clear idea what is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Read our literatures as far as possible. You have taken some book, I see, I saw. And if you agree to this principle, we take charge of you. You haven't got any botheration, how you'll get <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> We shall arrange for that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (young British woman):</span> Religion, meaning trying to serve God, is any more right than another?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not religion. This is the only business. Religion is different thing. Suppose... Just like... I have already explained, that you are sleeping, and you have got a good engagement. And somebody's trying to awake you, that "You have to go there. Just get up! Get up!" So this kind of business is not religion. Religion is a, what is a kind of faith, a sentiment. That is different thing. It is the main business of human being. Because we are part and parcel of... Just like a boy, he's very rich man's son. Some way or other, he's out of his home, and he's suffering for want of food, want of shelter. And somebody's giving information that "I know you are such and such big man's son. Why you are loitering in the street? Why don't you go back to your home, back to your father?" So is it not the best business. So everyone is suffering. That I have already explained, how they are suffering. We are trying to save his suffering by dispatching him back to home, back to Godhead. This is our business. So it is not religion. It is the most important humanitarian work. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are giving the right information, how human being can be really happy. This is end. It is not a religious sentiment. Religion means kind of faith. Today I am Hindu; tomorrow I am Christian; next day I am Mohammedan. What benefit I may get by changing so-called faith? Unless I understand what is my constitutional position, why I am suffering, how to get out of it? That is real life. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that. It is not a sentimental religious faith. It is not like that. It is absolutely necessary for the human being. We are talking of human being because without being a human being, nobody will be able... The cats and dogs, they will not be able to understand the problem. In the human form of life, you can make solution of all the problems of life. It is a science, how to make that solution. That we are teaching. We are not talking of religion. Religion... Somebody will say, "I believe," "We believe..." Another will, "We believe..." You believe, if it is not a fact, what is the use of such believing? We are dealing with facts, not the question of believing and not believing. Facts are facts. If you don't take facts, then you are missing the opportunity. (pause) You have got some visitors' book? To...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Visitors' book, to sign?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody told me they have got. You have seen all our books? You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have seen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Some of the little... (pause) (end)</div>
