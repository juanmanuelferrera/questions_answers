<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no arrangement for producing vegetable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We just finished one harvest, Prabhupāda, and now the second harvest is already in the ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what kind of harvest? You finish and then you have to wait six months for the second.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Now we are designing one plot for continuous...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, so this... Where is Tejas Mahārāja? So you immediately arrange for producing vegetables.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm asking Tejas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Here is Tejas, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, here he is. So, why don't you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> Yes. I'll make up the scheme today. It should be that you have continuous crop. You plant seeds one week... But again they have made the same mistake with these cauliflower and cabbage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, they mistake... You say, "They mistake." Who are "they"? You say you do mistake. Don't say, "they." This is bureaucracy, "they." You are all "they." Anyway, whatever is done, immediately make arrangement. And this is one thing. And the other thing, I came here that there will be festival and <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution. Why this is not begun?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Till yesterday there was being marriages in the city. Now, from today, the <span class="Italic">pandals</span> are free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there are marriages our program will be cancelled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No, but the person who gives us the <span class="Italic">pandal...</span> It's supposed to start today, Prabhupāda, their program. They have been advertising in the villages about the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution this evening, so the stage and the <span class="Italic">śāmiyānā</span> will be coming today and the pots are coming today. So we have all the grains and everything. We can start the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> distribution this evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you'll keep, come in charge. So do this also immediately. And the next is that Bhogilal wants to come here. So bring him immediately. What is the difficulty of that house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> All the plastering inside is finished now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything, whatever is finished...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Painting has to be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The toilets are working, all the connections are finished, and only thing is the painting has to be done today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So painting also can be... Without painting, we can go there. What is the wrong problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It looks a little shabby. If we wait for one more day it will look much better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one more day we shall wait, but tomorrow we must go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, tomorrow we can go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So arrange for bringing Bhogilal tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, tomorrow afternoon or evening we can arrange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes, so immediately arrange for that. He is very important man. If he comes you can all mature consultation about this female, about managing. He is practically doing. He has one thousand acres of land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh, yes, it's not a joke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he is practical business man. So immediately... And besides that, he is already sympathetic. He is becoming interested more. So he can do so many things for us. He is a very nice man. So he volunteered to come here. So bring him immediately. So arrange. From tomorrow we go there. If it is not finished, then he may be given that place. I am at here. I shall stay. Or he can be given this room; I can go there. In this way... Because the doors are not yet fitted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, that's the main problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there are so many main problems. So at least in my side the doors are fitted. So I can go there, and he can stay here. Anyway, either there or here, arrange to bring him immediately. He will go away by the twelfth. So he may stay here at least for one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> One week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tell him like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes. And the cooking will be done by his men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Because if he comes his cook will also come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. His cook and servant, yes. So make this arrangement so that everything should be inaugurated tomorrow, not more than that. So You have to purchase vegetable and then make a big, big scheme. <span class="Italic">Bambharambhe(?) laghu-kriyā. Ārambha,</span> very big, and action, very little. And ask some of our devotees to collect all the <span class="Italic">gobars</span> and bring here. I want <span class="Italic">gobar.</span> There so much <span class="Italic">gobars</span> scattered here and there. Take one basket and two men may go and collect all of them, put it in the sunshine. So nowadays sunshine is so bright. You can have so many things exposed to sunshine. All vitamins. So you immediately make program for vegetable, fruits, flower, surrounding this, immediately. So how Bhogilal will be brought here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> In his car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In his car. So make arrangement. Either we both of us, we may stay there or one here, one there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> And the secretaries can stay here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secretaries, as they are staying. I think one can manage that. There is no difficulty. [break] So all the devotees here, they are all required there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why... So the temple work is not suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> It is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are keeping so many devotees here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The main problem now is there were three <span class="Italic">pūjārīs,</span> and one of them is here, and he doesn't want to go back to <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> work, so we have to find...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He doesn't want to go back to do <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> work, so there's only two <span class="Italic">pūjārīs</span> and they were just complaining yesterday that it's very difficult to do so much Deity worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why? Why he does not want to go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He wants to go traveling for a while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that cannot be. So traveling means you have asked him to...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, I haven't asked him any... It's the same problem. Whenever I go somewhere there are always certain men; they want to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Nobody can go without sanction. This is sense gratification, "I want to." This is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The temple right now is in lack of a full time manager. Mahāṁśa Mahārāja spends most of his time here, and I can see that the temple management is not going right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not very nice. So do you require...? But you also do not remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are not there; you are not here. Then where you are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> No, all these last, last two weeks I've been working on this house and if I'm not here then... Like yesterday I was not here, and the workers didn't work properly. Then I made them work in the night. When I came back, I saw that they have not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that means everywhere, if you are not there, then everything is gone to hell. Then what is this management? You cannot be everywhere. That is not... You are not Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānām [Bg. 18.61].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I mean, the problem that came up in the temple, it was going on okay before, but then there was suddenly so many more devotees that came. Half of them were here, half of them were there, and they were moving around every day. So the temple managers were confused. They didn't know how much, how many devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, temple... Who is temple manager?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Ānandamaya is managing now. He's very good. He can do it nicely but he was confused because there were devotees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now there is no confusion. Immediately they can go, all the devotees. They are not required. What is the use?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That temple is a big, big project. Ānandamaya is not competent to handle the whole thing. He doesn't have the respect of the other members, enough. And I don't see him taking charge anymore. If you ask him to get something done he says, "Well..." He always makes some excuse. This was my experience while we were there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is that man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Ānandamaya. He has been here since four years, and he knows practically everybody in Hyderabad. He was working with me all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then why does he not go there? Why he's here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He's not here; he's there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So the devotees may go there. They have no business here to stay, so many. Why? They can return back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They need a head, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They need a head.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A head means you have to train head. If you cut head, then how there will be head? Neither tail, neither head. Head means you have to train them, head. There is no need of so many men here. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Many of the men who are here are on Haṁsadūta's party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do they require here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I sent all the men here because Mahāṁśa promised that there would be a program lined up but there is no program. That's why they're just... Now they all want to go, and if they can go I can send them. They are ready to go. They don't want to stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The problem is that the programs I didn't arrange because the devotees were not regular in coming. I didn't know when they were all coming. So if I arrange a program that means my men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But therefore the meeting is here. Do here now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, now it can be done. But I couldn't do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it can be done. Why can you...? What? When it will be done, do then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't make future promise. You do it immediately. Make program. But settle up when it will begin, when it is right. Here work is going on. That Mṛtyu, he cannot... No? Mūrti. So he cannot manage without him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He can. He has to be a little more acquainted with the people. He has to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is here from the last June. He is not acquainted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He's only here since about ten days. He's not here for a long time and he's not very forceful in making them do the work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who will be forceful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He can be trained. I'm training him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that training... Everyone is under training; then who will be head? If in old age you have to be trained up, then when they will be trained up? So what is the..., to sit down silently? That's all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> We'll send the parties out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make. Make immediately program, where to go. So why you are not making?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Now? Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, make program immediately. Write what to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> I was thinking one bus should go immediately to Kathinagar because they want to have program there and they are ready to arrange it and we can collect some money immediately for the expenses which are going on now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go. Go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So if you want, we could get one bus and few devotees can go on that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> But where is this place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Kathinagar. It's in Andhra Pradesh, Visakhapatnam near Waisac.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You have to make a program that on the way... Not that we drive one thousand miles to go to one program. That's not practical. Every fifty miles or so there should be some program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> That's what I mean. That whole course is... Andhra course is the richest area in Andhra Pradesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They give very nicely. We have had programs there, Prabhupāda, since three years. We've collected <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees from there and thousands of books have been distributed there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This I have heard even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> You have heard, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go there. What is the...? Make this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They can start today? The boys are ready. They want to move but it's just the leaders which have not decided on getting it done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So decide now. What is difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> If you can give one bus they can go immediately. And another party can go to Nagpur and start arranging for the program there on the 25th. They can do <span class="Italic">nagara-kīrtanas,</span> book distribution, and arrange for the program on the 25th and one bus can go to Kakinagar. So all the boys will be out and be engaged. And the boys from Hyderabad should go back to Hyderabad and get into the program there. There's so much work to be done in Hyderabad. They're suffering a lot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> What about the program here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> The program here doesn't need too many people. Only five, six people is enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> (aside:) Close the door.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Because the program here is just needing supervision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, but I mean <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> constant <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Well, if you want constant <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> then we have to have more devotees here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Constant <span class="Italic">kīrtana?</span> Who says constant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, we have to engage the villagers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they'll come in the evening. We cannot be always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we want to go <span class="Italic">nagara-saṅkīrtana</span> to the villages and announce the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Go. Well, go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German Devotee:</span> But we cannot go because Candrodaya, he doesn't want to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Take Rāma-kṣetra. He knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German Devotee:</span> Take as much as possible devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">German Devotee:</span> OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So write what you are going to do immediately. Write. Write the names, who is going where.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> (indistinct) ...they will leave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I just wrote down all the leaders. Ātmavidyā, Puṇyaśloka, Rājasāra. Otherwise I can go anywhere without fixing a program. I can go to any city. If no one is going to fix the program, I can go anywhere. That I was doing already. I came here because you promised me that in every city you know people, you can fix program. So fix them and then we'll go there. Otherwise there is no need to send anyone. We'll just go there and stay in a <span class="Italic">dharmaśālā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not go, one or two men, to fix up program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In Nagpur, a city like Nagpur, you say you have members. Send some man who knows them from your temple. He makes some arrangement. We go there, make a nice program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is going Nagpur? Write that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Vāsughoṣa and who from yours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I'll see later who goes. Anyone can go with him if he knows what to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Someone who can speak Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot expect from his party anyone speaking Hindi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> He has many... He has a good Rajasthani boy who is very good with Vāsughoṣa. He's in Hyderabad now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Who is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Vāsanta Kṛṣṇa, or somebody. They can take a van?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No need of van.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Well, if they're going to have to arrange a program in eight days, they have to run around to see so many people, get leaflets printed, get banners painted, see municipal people, see police people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For that reason van is required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, he can do everything by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> They have extra vans here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's not practical. I tell you, these vans... It's not practical to take these vans and drive them around the cities. It's very dangerous. It's not practical. It's easier to go by rickshaw.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> What about a small one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, the small ones. I mean, it's easier to go by rickshaw. It's a fact, you know. We had this experience...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is local bus. For one, two men van running is not good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> So one bus party goes immediately to Kakinagar with maybe Ātmavidyā or whoever...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Ātmavidyā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Ātmavidyā can lead that party. And one party goes to Nagpur as soon as that is fixed. And to fix that program, Vāsughoṣa and Vāsanta Kṛṣṇa can go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tejas:</span> But they should know. Otherwise if I come they may object, "Mahāṁśa Swami has to tell me." Just like I told this Yuthāgraja something.
