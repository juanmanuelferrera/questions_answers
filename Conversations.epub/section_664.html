<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither of you saw this? [break] ...in Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hindi books. Hindi books are selling very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what to do with this unfinished part? It will never be finished. That is the difficulty. We supplied three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees monthly. Still, when I come, it is unfinished. Unfinished. I do not know when it will be finished. And whenever money is given, the report is "Money is finished, but thing is not finished. Money is finished, but things are not finished."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Well, there's some ninety-four thousand rupees in the Punjab Bank, but that's for finalizing all the contracts. Saurab said that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your explanation there. I want to see that it is not (now?) finished. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All that money in the bank is to pay the overhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> So I wrote to him and he said that it is going for paying contracts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Contract, why don't you pay the contract? Liquidate all debts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Mr. Lahiri and Saurab are checking the bills. He said that you wanted it checked three or four times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> So that they have all the bills and contracts in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is checking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Bombay... Saurab and Mr. Lahiri together. He is coming this week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bill is paid. Now it is checking. And before paying the bill there was not check. This is going on. After payment, checking is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Final payments have not been made.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that will never be made, because you will never finish your business. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Saurab wrote me letter, and he told me that all remaining works have to be financed by the guesthouse, any money that was made from the guesthouse had to be utilized in finishing all works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is guest? So many things unfinished. It looks so bad. And you say everything is all right. What is all right? Do you know what is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We didn't have any money to finish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you say all right? Money is not there; then how it is all right? Why do you say all right? Say not all right. Money is not there. So this is the position. Guesthouse, if it is organized, yesterday we calculated we can get five hundred, six hundred rupees daily. So why it should not be done? That is also incomplete. Everything is incomplete. Source of income incomplete, and whole thing is incomplete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Guṇārṇava Prabhu has estimated that it will cost at least another five thousand rupees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> 75,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I know that even if it is given, 75,000, you'll never finish it. That I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we are doing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you will say, "Our estimate was wrong. We were mistaken." This is going on. Several times, "This is estimate," money paid-"No, it was wrong. Pay more." This is going on. What is the estimate, what is the right estimate, nobody knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What we will do is now we're going to be producing surplus from our income. That surplus is going to be used for fixing up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is "to be." I am speaking what is done. That I am speaking. That is "to be." The "to be" is going on for the last so many years. Now you utilize... You are getting money, but still "to be." You are getting so much money, daily income, two hundred rupees, three hundred rupees. Still "to be." You do not know what will be the actual solution. So many big, big heads, and there is no solution. I do not know what to do. So many things unfinished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So far, there wasn't any surplus. Now there's a surplus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the surplus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it will start coming. Now it is... From <span class="Italic">Jhulan-yātrā</span> our income has picked up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you have got money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now we will have a surplus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll... Again "to be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> End of this month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again "to be." Again, at the end of this month, again "to be." Again "will be." Say "We have no money." That's all. Why do you say indirectly? "It will be." So many managers and so many discrepancies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> Akṣayānanda Swami is going to collect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is collecting money. He is also paying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He hasn't been collecting that much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he has collected?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, when he went to Kanpur he collected 21,000</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is also gone to the belly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Out of the 21,000, five checks were returned, so 5,550 rupees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have gone to belly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No. They have to be deducted because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> So then what was the collection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Collection was sixteen thousand. And eight thousand went to the BBT.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why that eight thousand was not utilized to finish this business? BBT might be delayed, but what is this? Everything is unfinished. Huh? The doors are neither colored, neither painted, neither polished. As you have no money. And you are getting money and all going to the belly. So do rightly. You are so big, big heads. <span class="Italic">Baro baro badare baro baro pet laṅka dingake mata kare het:</span> "Big, big monkey, big, big belly-Ceylon jumping, melancholy." Huh? With big belly a monkey comes forward, and if you ask him, "Jump over like Hanumānji," finished, belly finished. These are Bengali words. <span class="Italic">Baro baro badare baro baro pet laṅka dingake mata kare het.</span> "I cannot do it." And why you have got so much belly? So this is not good. Make plan. You'll go on plan-making. Oh, you'll never be done. What can be done? I want to get rid of the management, but when I see, I have to see the management, how can I remain stopped? As soon as I see things are mismanaged, I have to say. I am not dumb. So this is the... And you report that "Everything is first class." What is this first class? Do you know meaning of first class? This is first class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm sorry. I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. You simply become sorry and everything is finished. That's all. I do not know what to do. [break] ... whatever you like. Whatever like, what can I do? (Bengali conversation) So what are you going to do about this finishing? Everything... (Hindi?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll start getting it done now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you'll do? You say you have no money. How you'll do it? Whole money is going to the stomach. All <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> all money, everything. And becoming sick and sleepy. Whole day and night sleep. I do not know when it will be finished. What is the use of starting another <span class="Italic">Gurukula?</span> Whatever you have taken, that is not yet finished. All savvy(?). And your report is, "Everything is all right." Everything is all right except nothing is finished. So I do not know how to do. There was shops made, and why it is closed again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Because Mr. Sharapi(?) came.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Let him go to the court. We shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Now he's agreed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then now again break; again make shop. This is going on. There was no expenditure to make the shop, and again closing, there was expenditure. So money is spent like this-"Make it and break it." That is American way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There is no cement. It is all mud, just muddy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explanation. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it happened on his land, he was very much against it, but those shops...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, but why did you not ask me? And why you did you not ask me before opening the shop, if you have no brain? If you have no brain, then why did you not ask? You give explanation, "Because that was not." That was not. So why did you do it? And money is coming, "Give me. Send me two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> four <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span>" and things are unfinished. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> There's still twenty minutes. We could begin the program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 7:30. We can have <span class="Italic">Guru-pūjā</span> now and small <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> before the Deities open. (end)</div>
