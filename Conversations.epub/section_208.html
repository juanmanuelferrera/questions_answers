<div class="Heading">Conversation in car<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>April 22, 1972, Tokyo</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Almost they have become Europeanized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The president seemed very interested, somewhat, in our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. He's a nice gentleman. (pause) They are still satisfied in wooden house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> The Japanese people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practically our sales are improving only for their printing. Their printing is very attractive, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Very much so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. You must admit that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. The attracting cover of a <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine, done so nicely, and the presentation and the devotees there-a man is just inclined, "Yes, let me see. Let me see what it's about." [break] (new sequence-Prabhupāda sings hari hari biphale in the car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We say that in whatever occupation you may be, try to find out some time and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. This is our preaching. So it will help you. At least you will get, even if you are attached to the material activities, you will get next birth a human body, rich family, another chance, or Vaiṣṇava family. That is also great benefit. Even there is no salvation, but he gets opportunity again. (sings another line) So Karandhara Prabhu, what advantage you will get by opening their office there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, all of the communications can be done with the liaison officer. He'll have a telex, so I won't have to wait for two weeks to get a letter back. I'll just speak with him, and he can telex. And we can save the money we're spending now on telex. And sometimes it's hard, sometimes it's hard for them to understand my English and it's hard for me to understand their English. It takes a little elaboration. So if there's a person there to speak with and he can speak with them in Japanese and with me in English, it's simpler.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, there will be a great many advantages, but they have to expend for that service. They will expect some more business. That will... We think we shall be able to give him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Also they should be able to... There's no reason why they can't find lots of business there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They will probably be able to find lots of other business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span> Oh yes. Therefore they are... Not that they are coming for our business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Right. Because they are businessmen, they have intelligent mind to use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are... This is only starting. Otherwise they'll have enough business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We've introduced them... Mr. Oyage, he's in Los Angeles now. We've introduced him to a big printing agent. So he may make some more business also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They will get. Automatically they will get. Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. (sings hari hari biphale) Is it far?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Hare Hare, Hare Rāma Hare Rāma Rāma Rāma Hare Hare. Some new devotees are joining us in our all centers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Not so many as before, but the ones that are coming are much more fixed up. Before some would... Ten would come and seven would leave. But now they don't come so much, but when they come, they stay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They stay. (sings softly) The students dress like policemen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Yes. They all wear uniform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Right now there are twelve <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> in Los Angeles who are getting ready to go to India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They'll be going on about the 5th of May, the 6th of May. I think also the same number in New York are preparing to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we have got enough place. Yes. Very nice place, Vṛndāvana. And we are expected to get another place at Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's birth place. Oh, that is very nice place also. (end)</div>
