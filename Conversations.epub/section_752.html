<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ....when he has gone to send (indistinct) that you have offered some room here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No, well there was, on the floor space there is facility for a doctor, so he saw that on the plan, so he proposed that "Well, I'm a dentist, so I can give the devotees free service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there will be no medical service in the building. (Hindi to some men) These quarters there is no such building, huh? Our, this pattern?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. Not in Bombay, nowhere in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckling) That's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There will be after this, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> After this there will be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Imitation. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> There should not be any medical service in the building, new building, so what about there should be any other place on the land, or they should not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall do conveniently. It is not very urgent. When there is spare room-then. Medical service is to cure the material disease, not this temporary headache and stomachache. There are so many medical services for these things, but where is the medical service for curing <span class="Italic">bhava-roga,</span> material disease? That is wanted. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! Medical service does not give any guarantee that there will be no more disease. Our service is guarantee, there will be no more birth, death, old age and disease. That is the difference. (pause) Mauritius, I was suffering so much from dental pain, I never went to the dentist; I invented my medicine, and it cured. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Now everyone else is using it here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I taught them all, and they're all using it now. Or they will all be using it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They like it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, yes. The best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? The only defect is that all the ingredients are not very finely powdered. If it is very finely powdered, then it will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You are perfect in all respects. You are your own doctor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not doctor, but I created many doctors. [break] (to Dr. Patel:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi: <span class="Italic">ap lok hamye sa chaye</span>) I have decided not to come today with you. Because I was driven away yesterday morning by your men. I came to look after you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> God only knows. They have behaved so very badly, be three of us. And you were not sleeping even, because I wanted to give you the prescription, so I ran from my house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> No, I was not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, you were not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> No, I was there. You had just taken rest in the bedroom, so I thought it best not to disturb you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, I was taking rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I wrote out the prescription and gave it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I got that. Huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> So you can come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I was resting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I won't come. I want only humble obeisances today. Thank you very much. (leaves)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he wanted to see me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> He brought two of his friends in as well. I thought he was going to create such a commotion, and you had just taken rest, so I said better to let you rest and not disturb you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to passerby) Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">(japa)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanatha:</span> All over the world, the Ratha-yātrā attracts thousands of people, but in Bombay we'll not have Jagannātha Deities, so how could we have Ratha-yātrā and attract people? (indistinct) give some correction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...our temple then.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> A question was raised about Lord Rāma worshiping Śiva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> At one of the programs, somebody raised the question that we cited that Lord Śiva is worshiping Kṛṣṇa, that he is a Vaiṣṇava. So that person replied that Lord Rāma also worshiped Śiva. So he wanted to know the explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You explained yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes Kṛṣṇa is chastised by mother Yaśodā. So how is that? The Supreme Personality of Godhead is being chastised by mother Yaśodā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He likes to be chastised. It's part of the relationship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, He likes to worship His devotee. Sometimes the father takes the child on his shoulder. Does it mean the child is more important than the father? They say the Vālmīki <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> there is no such incidence as Rāmacandra worships Śiva. It is later on, interpretation. But even if He does so, what is the wrong here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That later-on <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> has caused some havoc.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That later-on interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the Śaivaites, they want to make Lord Śiva the exalted Supreme Person. In South India there is good propaganda. That is always going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> When Lord Śiva says in <span class="Italic">Purāṇas</span> that <span class="Italic">mukti-pradapaḥ sarveṣāṁ viṣṇu...</span> (sic)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> <span class="Italic">Purāṇa,</span> the same Lord Śiva says there is no other liberated besides Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...engagement, one devotee commented that the reason that Lord Rāma worshiped Lord Śiva was because He wanted to kill Rāvaṇa and Rāvaṇa was a devotee of Śiva, so Lord Rāma worshiped Śiva in that respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He said that because Lord Śiva was, ah, excuse me, Rāvaṇa was a devotee of Lord Śiva, that in order that Lord Rāmacandra could kill Rāvaṇa, He worshiped Śiva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> He wanted to take permission of him, so they say. Rāma wanted to take permission from Śiva...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Śiva is so rascal that he gave permission? That means they are trying to prove Śiva is a rascal. (devotees laugh) Because he gave permission to kill his devotee. Then what is the use of his, of one becoming Śiva's devotee? If such a rascal that one can take his permission to kill his devotee, so what is the use of becoming a devotee of such a rascal? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He protected Bāṇāsura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that? That means that proving that Śiva is a rascal. He gave permission to kill his devotee. Then what is the use? Then nobody should become Śiva's devotee. That is the conclusion. Because he gives permission to somebody else to kill his devotee. They are trying to prove Lord Śiva is a rascal. What do you think? Huh? If I want your permission, please give me your permission, I shall kill your son, and if you say, "Yes, I give my permission," then are you not a rascal? By this example they are making Lord Śiva a rascal, that he has no common sense even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if this proposition is there, that Lord Śiva gives permission for killing his devotee, then who will become his devotee? Huh? Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No sane man will become his devotee. All the manufactured foolish statements, just see. Any commonsense man will immediately say, "Then Śiva is a rascal; he cannot give protection to his devotee." What do you think? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Of course, Śrīla Prabhupāda, does one have to give protection to their devotee if they break the law? Just like if you have a child, and he murders someone, isn't he supposed to be punished? So if someone goes against the Supreme Personality of Godhead, even if you are a devotee, shouldn't Śiva concur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is another thing. This proposal, that because Lord Rāmacandra approached Lord Śiva to kill Rāvaṇa, and he gave permission, although Rāvaṇa was his great devotee. Then what is the use of becoming devotee of Lord Śiva? He gives permission. Huh? Is that very reasonable proposal? If I ask your permission that I shall kill your son, will you give permission? No. Then? So Lord Śiva gives permission to Lord Rāmacandra, "Yes, You can kill Rāvaṇa," then what is the use of becoming his devotee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think Dr. Patel would say that it's not fair, you have fired the opposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's not fair. You have completely destroyed the opposition. (Prabhupāda laughs) There is no question of fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The actual fact is that Lord Śiva did not give permission, but he did not go to protect Rāvaṇa, because he knew that it was impossible to give him protection. That is summarized in Bengali, <span class="Italic">rākhe kṛṣṇa māre ke, māre kṛṣṇa rākhe ke.</span> If Kṛṣṇa kills somebody, wants to kill somebody, nobody can give him protection. That is the conclusion. And if Kṛṣṇa protects somebody, nobody can kill him. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Huh? He was protected by Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva. Who can kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Why did Lord Śiva try to protect Banasura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Didn't Lord Śiva try to protect Banasura?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You must try, when your son is in danger, you must try. That is natural. That is not uncommon. You can save or not save, that is a different thing. But it is you duty, if somebody is under your protection, you must try to save him, even at the risk of your life. That is real protector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Do you have plans, Śrīla Prabhupāda, to comment on <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> in future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? First of all finish my <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> then we shall talk of other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Lord Brahmā took away the cows and the cowherd boys that Kṛṣṇa was playing with. At that time Kṛṣṇa expanded Himself just to (indistinct) about a year or so that these cows are all Kṛṣṇa expansions, but the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> were so much (indistinct) to (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa's (indistinct). Now he started, he doubted that <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are (indistinct) with Kṛṣṇa because these cowherds and ah, they are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa only, so he was not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That is called, they were playing the role of human being. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...would be nearing the portion where that (indistinct) is there. I told Girirāja prabhu, when you were sick, that fever is there, you were having fever, so I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I had no fever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> When you went to Vṛndāvana? Some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So I was telling my wife, she said that you read that <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> where that Bāṇ(āsura) is there, that Śiva means having, producing <span class="Italic">jvārā,</span> fever, so Viṣṇujvārā is cold only, so that Viṣṇujvārā will bring down the fever. So you were just reading more <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> only, when you are sick. Anybody who is suffering from fever means you read such and such a portion, so it should come down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Viṣṇu should not be utilized for curing your fever. (laughter) That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> That is business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So you are always reaching for <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> point. That is too high for mundane people to reach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> high, highest. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you have real <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> then you can understand Vaiṣṇava. To know Viṣṇu-<span class="Italic">avan manasā-gocara:</span> it is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Verse">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahareṣu<br class="calibre2"/>kaścit yatati siddhaye<br class="calibre2"/>yatatām api siddhānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kaścid māṁ vetti tattvataḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 7.3]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">To understand Viṣṇu-very, very difficult. And.... If, but you can understand Viṣṇu by <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is so easy thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> How about if a disciple wants to use the help of Viṣṇu for the spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> A disciple wants to take the aid of Viṣṇu for serving the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah. That is nice. That is for curing Viṣṇu's representative. When we were in danger, there was so much obstruction for constructing the temple, and we prayed to Kṛṣṇa that it should stopped. We prayed to Kṛṣṇa, "Please give your protection." That is for Viṣṇu's purpose. [break] ...<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, arto 'rthārthī jijñāsur:</span> when one is in distress, he comes to Kṛṣṇa. So that is not pure <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Pure <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means, "I shall not take a farthing from Kṛṣṇa; I shall give everything to Kṛṣṇa." That is pure. "I shall not take any return from Kṛṣṇa." Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "I am not a merchant, that for my service I take some return for it." No. But sometimes when, since we are not pure devotees, we have no other alternative than to beg Kṛṣṇa for some material benefit. That is also good. They have said, <span class="Italic">catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ, sukṛtinaḥ,</span> that pious. Although they are not pure devotee, but they are pious. But the <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ,</span> they do not approach Him. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Verse">catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janāḥ sukṛtino'rjuna<br class="calibre2"/>arto 'rthārthī jijñāsur<br class="calibre2"/>jñānī ca bharatarṣabhā<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 7.16]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">They are also good, pious. And one who does not go to Viṣṇu for any reason, they are most sinful. Here, although he goes to Viṣṇu for some material benefit, he is pious. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are impious, sinful, they do not go. (comes to a part of beach covered by waves) So I will have to jump like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, we made the wrong turn.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> [break] ...window glass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> (everyone laughs) The light is here, but it appears light is there. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> The real world is the spiritual world, and here it is simply a reflection, but we are taking this is real world, and spiritual, there is no spiritual. <span class="Italic">Yathā bhāsaḥ tathā tamo.</span> So Śaṅkarācārya said that this world is false, <span class="Italic">jagan mithya.</span> So, but <span class="Italic">brahma satyam,</span> he gave the same information. But we are taking this <span class="Italic">jagat satyam,</span> and there is no spiritual world. This is the defect. Just like.... (aside:) That's all right. ...the mirage, the foolish animal goes after the water in the desert, but there is no water. He is bewildered. But that does not means there is no water anywhere else. There is water, but this mirage water is false. Similarly, this material world is false, but that does not mean there is no spiritual world. The water is somewhere else. That you do not know. But you are after this mirage, water in the desert. (Hindi conversation with man, about water) (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa! <span class="Italic">Yatra tri-sargo'mṛṣā. Tejo vāri-mṛdāṁ vinimayo yatra tri-sargo'mṛṣā dhāmnā svena sadā nirasta-kuhakaṁ satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi [SB </span>1.1.1<span class="Italic">].</span> Vyāsadeva offers his respect to the real truth, <span class="Italic">satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi,</span> where there is no mirage, there is no false world; real world. And Kṛṣṇa gives the same information: <span class="Italic">yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramaṁ mama [Bg. 15.6].</span> "That is My real abode, where if you go you don't come back. And so long you are in this material world, <span class="Italic">bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> you accept one body, suffer or enjoy, there is no enjoyment, suffering, and again accept another body; <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara praptir.</span>" This is going on. Therefore they do not understand when you speak of the other world. But if you speak of this world, that "I'll make you happy in this world," thousands and millions will follow you. And as soon as you say that "I shall make you happy in the next world," "These are all nonsense, crazy fellow!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They think it's too imaginary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Post-dated check!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And.. Not post-dated! That is real check, but he does not know. He refuses real check. That is not post-dated; it is real check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they might say that we're always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They might say, that is another thing. (Hindi conversation with man about blind leading the blind)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> [break] ...body is finished, everything is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> When body is finished, everything is finished, so why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. You were a child; that body is finished. So you have got a different body. But this simple truth they do not understand; that is their folly. If the body is finished, then why you were a child, you have become a young man? Body is finished, but not everything is finished, everything is there. Only the body is finished. <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is explained. So when the body is finished, that does not mean that you are finished. You have to accept another body. That is real truth, and it is spoken by Kṛṣṇa, not any so-called scientist. The Supreme Person says, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre.</span> What do they say about this statement of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre,</span> that when your body is finished you are not finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Well they won't accept Kṛṣṇa either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, how rascal they are!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct) you know there is soul.</div>

It has got a birth, it has got a death that only are superfluous, say only for consolation. But actually it does not die. Body dies, or body destroyed, and that is (indistinct) or suffering. But, when I do something good or bad in this life, see, I am doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are doing, and therefore you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But that is not <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> Why <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (spluttering) ...naturally, but listen what I say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, the <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, antavanta ime dehā nityasyoktāḥ śarīriṇaḥ [Bg. </span>2.18]<span class="Italic">. Nityasyoktāḥ, nityasyoktāḥ, śarīriṇaḥ. Śarīriṇaḥ</span> means the soul who possesses this body, he is <span class="Italic">nitya.</span> So, you have to enjoy or suffer the reaction of your activities. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have got a type of body on account of your activities.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are doing sin, you have to control.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So if I am doing sins, you mean to say, that <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is doing because that is his responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If manager does..., if the worker does something wrong, the manager is indirectly responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Why do you say manager? You are doing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, but suppose...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No "I suppose." That is not suppose. You are doing sinful activities or pious activities. It is you, <span class="Italic">ātmā, jīvātmā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So that means <span class="Italic">jīvātmā,</span> he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Responsible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> ...responsible for any good or bad deeds for my life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because he's controller of the body. So he's responsible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bodies only means, suppose you are motorcar, you are driving this way or that way, the motorcar is not driving you. You are driving the motorcar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Huh huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> What does it mean in the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> Prabhupāda, when Kṛṣṇa says only the modes of material nature are acting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Material nature means because you are in diseased condition in this material world, therefore according to the infection. Just like you have got body, and he has got body. You are suffering from typhoid; he is suffering from smallpox. So you have contaminated the typhoid germs, and he has contaminated smallpox. So the, this body is after all material body, so there is infection of material nature, <span class="Italic">tri-guṇātmaka.</span> Therefore you have to transcend this position of <span class="Italic">tri-guṇātmaka.</span> Then you are cured.</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicārena<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>braham-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">If you transcend the infection of the three modes of material nature, then you are safe. So long you do not transcend, just like so long we infect some disease, then you must suffer. But if you don't infect, you'll not suffer. That is up to you. There is disease, cholera disease; why shall I go there? Why shall I infect my body in that way? That is up to you. If you don't take precaution, then you will suffer. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> The soul is pure, part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but he is covered by the material body. The material body is infected by the modes of material nature. Therefore, although he is pure, he is subjected. Just like when there is motor accident, you are separate from the motor, but you have to suffer. Everyone knows that I am separate from the motorcar, but why I am suffering? Because you have got bad car, you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> That may be because I'm an imperfect driver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are imperfect; therefore this movement is to make you perfect. If you are not imperfect, then why the movement is there? To make you perfect. <span class="Italic">Saṁsiddhiṁ paramaṁ gataḥ. Mām upetya kaunteya duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So long you are imperfect, you must suffer in this material world. And as soon as you become perfect, you go back to home, back to.... Because you are imperfect, therefore this movement is necessary. Medicine is there for the patient, not for the person in perfect health. <span class="Italic">Mūdho' yaṁ nābhijānāti mām eva param avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> These rascals they do not know Kṛṣṇa; therefore the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is necessary. <span class="Italic">Para upakāra.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says <span class="Italic">para upa, para upakāra.</span> You know yourself what is Kṛṣṇa, and distribute this knowledge. That is wanted. That is entrusted to the Indians.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">This is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> So the soul is the doer and the nondoer of the activities, sinful activities, or, as the soul is pure, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like when you are condemned to death by the judgment of the high-court, so who is the doer, the high-court judge, or you? Huh? Is the high-court judge your enemy, that he has condemned you to death? He has given the judgment; you cannot say he is the doer. You are the doer. So <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> and <span class="Italic">Paramātmā.</span> You do, and <span class="Italic">Paramātmā</span> gives judgment. <span class="Italic">Daiva-netreṇa.</span> By the superior judgment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But it is said all the actions are carried out by the three modes of material nature, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> ...the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is just the non-doer. <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> doesn't do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. He has put himself to the shelter of material nature. As soon as you come to India or you come to some other country, you must be under the laws of that country. So why do you come here? <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa bhuliyā jīva bhagavān sa kari.</span> You have come to the material world to enjoy, so you must suffer also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> We've seen the example used, Prabhupāda, that just like a man, if he goes to sleep at night and he dreams that he has committed some murder or some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why does he dream?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> ...he enjoys or suffers the activities, but actually he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but why he dreams like that? One is dreaming like that, another is dreaming a different way. That is due to his practice. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrīdhara:</span> People say then that the soul must be impure. If the soul can, not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impure in this sense: that he has come in touch with the impure. And if he becomes untouched with the impure, then he is no more impure. That is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicāreṇa<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatityaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Immediately he becomes pure. Kṛṣṇa says,</div>
<div class="Verse">sarva-dharmān parityajya<br class="calibre2"/>mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo<br class="calibre2"/>mokṣayīṣyāmi...<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 18.66]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"I shall make you immediately pure." Why don't you do that? You want to remain impure, so you must suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> Therefore everything is situated on desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. We are desiring to enjoy the sense enjoyment of this material world, then you remain impure. So long you shall desire sense enjoy.... Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> make zero all your desires, material desires. Desire cannot be zero. Purīfy your desires. Desire how to serve Kṛṣṇa. Then it is pure. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> "No other desires."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Āra nā.... guru mukha padma vakhya cittete koriya aikyā āra nā korioa mane āśā.</span> That is purification. A guru says something, and you do something else, then you are desiring something, then you are not pure. Therefore daily you are saying, <span class="Italic">āra nā koriho mane āśā.</span> Don't desire anything. Then you remain pure. As soon as you decide that "I shall serve only Kṛṣṇa," you become pure, immediately. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayīṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are delivered from all sinful reactions, then how you are impure? You keep that position, pure position, then your life is successful. <span class="Italic">Āra nā koriho...</span> And if you plan something (chuckles) "I am very expert in planning; I shall do this, I shall do that, not serve Kṛṣṇa," then you remain impure.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the disturbed mind. Those who are settled up, they can see always, open or closed. <span class="Italic">Premāñjanacchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu viloka.</span> One who has attained that stage, love of God, he can see every, every moment. When you love somebody, a small child, don't you see always, huh? Don't you see? Huh? When you see the child's little sock, immediately you see the child. The shoes, immediately you see the child. Why? Because you are in love with the child. So that stage you have to come, in love with God, then you will see always, twenty-four hours, <span class="Italic">sadaiva. Sadaiva</span> means twenty-four hours. You see, and you always remain in <span class="Italic">nirguṇa</span> stage, and always see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> But in that case, sir, material duties, they are forgotten.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Then how can you avoid that, because conflict takes place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it will be, there will be no more material duty. When you wash the shoes of your son, that is love, that is not a shoe washer; you don't remain a shoe washer. You remain in love with your child. Hm? A mother takes care of the child, washes, when he passes stool, that does not mean she becomes <span class="Italic">maṭharāṇī</span> (sweeper woman). <span class="Italic">Maṭharāṇī</span> is material. But when the mother out of love washes the child, she is not <span class="Italic">maṭharāṇī,</span> she is Rādhārāṇī. (everyone laughs) And if you conclude, "Ah, she is washing the stool of the son. She is <span class="Italic">maṭharānī,</span>" that is your mistake. She remains Rādhārāṇī. Just like mother Yaśodā is binding Kṛṣṇa, that does not mean that His supremacy is lost. The mother Yaśodā is binding; He still remains the supreme. Therefore mother Yaśodā became exhausted to try to bind Him. (laughs) And when Kṛṣṇa saw that "My mother is perspiring now, she is exhausted," "All right, let Me agree to be bound up by her." (pause) That's not a fact, otherwise how Kṛṣṇa says, "Anyone who is engaged in My devotional service, <span class="Italic">sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span>" So this is a mistake to say that devotional service is <span class="Italic">saguṇa.</span> (indistinct) Huh?
