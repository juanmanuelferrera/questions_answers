<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> There is one rented motel for you Prabhupāda. There's a section of a small motel. He has rented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Who has rented?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Checks. These are checks, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. When you bring checks, I am very glad. (chuckles) So how much you have deposited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In which account?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, Tamāla Kṛṣṇa was writing that he wanted that... I have saved up for Māyāpura thirty thousand. But he said to send it there. So I have been waiting. He wrote a letter and said to send the money there. So I wrote him and told him he has to have him and Jayapatākā sign a requisition, I think. I instructed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Lugdu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. What is this? Some picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten thousand was transferred from my account. So that has been replaced or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I have it. I didn't put it in the account because I thought you wanted me to send it to Māyāpura. But I haven't sent it yet. I still have it in another account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You just informed Tamāla that from now on we would send only books, that we would prefer to send books from this side and let them sell them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The thing is that you were collecting something for Māyāpura account?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how much it has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Thirty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thirty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Separate from books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> That's separate from books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this ten thousand was given from my account. So this has to be replaced. And then, whatever you have got for Māyāpura account, that is to be transferred. That was a trial business. So we took from bank ten thousand worth. So that is done. Now you transfer the ten thousand to my account, and balance you keep ready for transferring. That also I will advise you how to do. Besides that, out of the 33,000, you deposited eighteen thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No. 18,600.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I still owe fifteen thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That money is not yet done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> By June.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. By June. All right. We shall talk further. What is this? So Los Angeles is... Everything is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes Prabhupāda. Those are all... All the different envelopes are from the different departments, Spiritual Sky, Mail Order, Iskcon Media.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you keep it in this envelope. Then I shall see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They have purchased $8,000 worth of equipment for recording your voice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That will be very nice. So I can give lectures daily? No. What is the arrangement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. As soon as you come, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we're going to shoot the first TV show.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> You have a video tape machine here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, if I explain some of... Just like I explain one verse. In this way, if I do explain one verse, do you think it will be all right? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Each day explain one verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each day or as you like. Or what is your program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, as far as this recording, we have a studio right there in the temple. You could record...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You distribute that <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> little, everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> This <span class="Italic">lugdu?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I will also take little. Distribute. What is your program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, we thought we could do both because we have a recording studio for sound. So you can come into the recording studio and record as much as you wanted, all day long. The shooting for the TV show... We worked out a program of shooting each week forty minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you take more. Why little, little? Give more. Give me also little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. It is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda distributes mercy to the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has made it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Dhruvānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He is good cook?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. He has made nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Shall I save one for later for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No saving. (laughter) Give me immediately. (laughter) Give them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Prabhupāda? Your Divine Grace? I have a question. I was always under impression or understanding from your teachings, that one never eats in front of the Deities. Can you please explain that? Cause I understand you are pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He says that he always understood that one should not eat in front of the Deity. What is the difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Difference is generally we should not eat before the Deity. But there is another injunction, <span class="Italic">prasādaḥ prāptir mātreṇa bhoktavyaḥ.</span> As soon as we get <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> you should immediately eat (laughter. Sound of Prabhupāda eating <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span>) Take this. So we shall have to go there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yes. We can go now. Here is some water. You can wash out the window. It's dirt below.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone got? Everyone? No, I shall go there. (end)</div>
