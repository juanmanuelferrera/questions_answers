<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not <span class="Italic">kīrtana. Kīrtana, ārati, bhoga,</span> lecture, so many ways. I have explained this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...big hotel, ISKCON Vegetarian Hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Five star.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One of the big points is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...five star hotel. It must be very gorgeous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately submit plan and... Where is Surabhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Surabhi? He's here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you get plan for hotel in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Inside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Full front of the land, whole front land. No temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Only hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. With a hall, hall on the ground floor. Covering the whole land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not for the whole ground floor. First floor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the first floor, one big, big hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Only hotel? One plan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have got the site plan of the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Surabhi:</span> Yes, I have all the plans for Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Then you can make a sketch. [break] ...plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One thing you should know, Prabhupāda. The hotels in that area are being sold. ["Hotel" in India may mean merely a restaurant. <span class="Italic">Publisher's note.</span>]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them be sold. Our hotel does not depend on them. We are always independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Why are they being sold? For lack of people coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Whatever the people may be doing, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two hotels?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two. King's Hotel, and Horizons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Are for sale, or they have been sold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are selling. The owners are selling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say... I spoke with one hotel man, and he says the price of petrol is now three rupees, twenty-five paise per liter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Petrol now costs three rupees twenty-five per liter. That means about three or four times what it was previously. So people are not so much inclined; since they have their business in the city, if they stay in Juhu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is one of the reasons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...they have to go all the way from Juhu into the city. It costs twenty-five rupees by taxi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> This is happening all over the world to the hotel business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> All over the world. All over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hotel business declining?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> All over. Because of the petrol shortage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it's not permanent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> They'll have to do something, because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not permanent. The thing is that our life, if we put up a hotel, Prabhupāda, all of our life members, at least, I know, in fact, will use the hotel. Plus many foreigners will still use. Because we are not, we are not... Our hotel will not simply be for the business foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is for spiritual culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Spiritual culture. Right. So for that purpose it makes no difference the center of the city or elsewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...dependent any condition. We are independent. And you are criticizing. Permit has not been obtained. And if you think that there is no possibility of temple being sanctioned, then we start hotel. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, that is already there. But if the sanction is not there, what we will do? Keep the land vacant? [break] That I am trying to get sanction, "Is it all right." If you don't, then hotel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise build a hotel in the front and a temple in the rear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And then it satisfies both. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The same view. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One man's walking, Letchmore Heath.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is like this. Atmosphere is little different. It was cold out. The sky is not so clear. Otherwise, land view is the same. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Remembering that Kṛṣṇa's here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's always the memory that Kṛṣṇa's here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Kṛṣṇa is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> When Prabhupāda was walking in Letchmore Health, he said, "This looks like Govardhana Hill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bicyclist:</span> (ringing bell) Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa! Hare Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's like you said last night. They begin to chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Do the rickshaw drivers in Letchmore Heath chant Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they were sleeping. (laughter) That is western. Here you will find even the old man rises early in the morning. Yes, take bath. Without any reference to Hare Kṛṣṇa. They chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. In the village, they take bath early in the morning. That is very healthy. [break] ...I have generally... (indistinct) (heavy wind noise)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Mixed with moisture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know. The scientists say that it is a blazing fire, sun planet. Fire is generally red color with little yellow. Why it is white? We have no experience of fire, white. So how do they say it is fire? That is my question. [break] ...tell me what blue I have seen. Red I have seen. Where is white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> (indistinct) the sun is a reflection of the <span class="Italic">brahmajyoti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another. First of all, you answer whether it is fire or something else. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...dew.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is the moisture? It is clear shine. Where is the moisture? [break] (laughter) It is not fire. It is a brilliant body. It is not fire. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...body of Vivasvān?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whole planet, I mean the population, they're so bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sometimes in your lectures you explain the living entities can live there because they have bodies of fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fiery. Not fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Fiery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there is heat and brightness, therefore they can say fire. Just like, what is called, diamond. Diamond looks like, bright, like this beautiful. But that is not fire. Diamond, real diamond, you keep in dark room; it will be light. But that is not fire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Effulgent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Bright. Brightness. (heavy wind noise) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That stars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stars? They are planets like this planet. Like moon planet, the moon planet. <span class="Italic">Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī.</span> The stars, they are so many moons, not suns. They say "sun." And we say, "No, it is moon." Sun is only one. In each universe there is one sun, but there are many planets like moons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Reflections.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reflection. We get it from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Nakṣatrāṇām ahaṁ śaśī.</span> (heavy wind noise) [break] ...due to the sun, reflect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Why does the moon reflect? They say the moon is sandy, but this sand here is not reflecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... They are not going to the moon planet. They are going to some other planet, Rahu planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru dāsa:</span> Rahu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many planets invisible. So there is a Rahu planet which comes in front of the moon planet, and that is called eclipse. So there is a planet rotating. I think they are going to that Rahu planet, not to the moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> How can they make such a mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> How is it that they made such a big mistake?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their whole life is mistake. (laughter) They cannot do anything but mistake. Why you are so much confident about that? Their whole life is simply mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, they see a little fire, and they see that it has heat and light, and so they see a huge thing having heat and light, and so they conclude that that's also a fire. So if that's their deductive method, then if they see that whenever there's intelligence, there must be a person, then why don't they conclude that behind the universe, there's so many wonderful things, that there must also be a person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we say there are persons, combination of fiery persons. Therefore it looks so bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Is the brightness of a diamond because of the presence of a <span class="Italic">jīva?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> The brightness...? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose you get a diamond body. Just like glowworm. Glowworm, it has a glowing body. That's all. But the glowing substance is different from the soul. Owner of the body is different. What he's doing? [break] ...came other day, morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...have purchase this land for him for preaching Christian Bible. So he, maybe he was getting some salary on this land in this way. He gave up Gauḍīya Maṭha association and he became Christian. So I know that this land belonged to him. His wife was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe at Allahabad. He's the proprietor. He was Mr. Cakravarti. (end)</div>
