<div class="Purp-para">(Hindi-Dr. Patel and another man)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The country is already murdered. What are you talking of murder now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> I don't want to talk of these things. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They have gone mad now, sir. Actually they have ransacked the morality of this land, and they are going to ransack the social conditions. (Hindi) I have got one rifle, one revolver and one pistol. I am keeping always with me now. (Hindi) These people, sir, have really ruined this, this batch of rulers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sadar Patel by (indistinct). He was a man of practice. He could have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who will live? Everyone will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Everyone will die, that's right. These people, they behave as if they are living permanently. Then they are doing a bad thing, they think that they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to tolerate. There is no other way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.</span> They come and go. You have to do your business, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. These people will come and go. Place everything at the mercy of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Patel and friend talk in Hindi aside) I don't drink. I hardly, I hardly go out one evening now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? So what about this land we have given? Where is Saurabha? He is not coming? What about this land we have given for road?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> That is effasigh(?). We are using as effasigh(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So effasigh(?) we are going to have for these evenings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> We have about 60,000 sq. ft. of area we can build.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are going to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> For the other building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. You were speaking about constructing another building on the back of the land. We can have one big building of about one hundred and eighty rooms easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One hundred eighty rooms? One hundred eighty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very fine. After the building of this completely as per plan...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. And then we still have area for <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> also. Another hundred rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Most people (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday... Last night, I explained at the Birla house that you have to change only your care of. Now we are care of under material energy, and you have to transfer your under care of spiritual energy. They appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are under the care of great <span class="Italic">māyā, mah-māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...is sitting in the building, of all the Birlas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Birlas, everyone. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (also laughing) I don't know, sir. But I... I am a rebellion against them. In 1958, sir, I told you, the Congress, when I was a member of Congress, that I can't be the member of such an institution which just simply lies, telling white lies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You may say about congressman, and this one, Communist man; everyone is under...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our verdict. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> We understand from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> sir. <span class="Italic">Mudhatamaḥ!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">vimūḍha.</span> Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says not only <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> but <span class="Italic">vimūḍha</span>; <span class="Italic">viśeṣa-mūḍha</span> especifical. Prahlādah Mahārāja says the same thing: <span class="Italic">tato vimūkha-cetasā. Vimūkha cetasā</span> means one who does not accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha-cetasa soce,</span> and simply thinking of desires. Who are this? Those who are nondevotees, one who does not surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tato vimukha-cetasa.</span> So why you are searching? <span class="Italic">Māy-sukhāya:</span> simply for so-called sense gratification for a few days, <span class="Italic">bhāram udvahato vimūḍhān,</span> making big, big plans. I am thinking of these rascals. What for they are making big, big plans? They will stay here for a few days, and forgetting Kṛṣṇa consciousness they are busy in making plans. This is Prahlāda Mahārāja. And Kṛṣṇa says they are <span class="Italic">mūḍha, vimūḍha.</span> As soon as you find one, not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's immediately <span class="Italic">mūḍha, vimūḍha. Na mā duṣkṛtino mūḍh prapdyante narādhamāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That knowledge is, I mean, perished by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will help you. If you want to forget Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> will help you, how you can more and more forget.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> would help us even for finding out Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. <span class="Italic">māyā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...because the body is the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the mind is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> and the very mind will help us, sir, that doesn't it help us to go towards Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is not <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> help. When you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not bother with your business. That means you get relief from <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You are no more under the jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You..., now you are under the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will trouble you so long you do not go in the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. <span class="Italic">Ye mā prapadyante māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And as soon as you go under the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān paritiyaja mām ekam,</span> then there is no jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like as soon as the sun rises there is no more darkness, automatically. You do not require to dissipate the darkness. As soon as there is sun, everything is light. (aside to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya! Mam eva ye prapadyante māyām etā taranti te.</span> This is the process. It is simple method. To become under the jurisdiction of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> it requires great labor. But to become under the jurisdiction of Kṛṣṇa, it takes a minute. But these rascals will not do that. Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa Himself has made your eyes, all these <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> outgoing, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Indriya,</span> He has made your eyes to see Kṛṣṇa, not a prostitute. That is your fault. Kṛṣṇa has given you eyes to see Him, but you are utilizing to see a prostitute. That is not Kṛṣṇa's fault; that is your fault. Eyes are not bad. Kṛṣṇa has given you eyes to see: Kṛṣṇa. But we are utilizing for other purpose. That is our fault. We are presenting this Kṛṣṇa's Deity in the temple, but who is coming to utilize his eyes? Nobody is coming. They will go to see cinema, beautiful actress; so they are ultilizing the eyes for this purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have seen the last cinema in '58. "Gone with the Wind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not your eyes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It was "Gone with the Wind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are misusing everything. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means stop this misuse. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">,</span> that is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Whatever you have got, utilize it properly. Don't misuse it. That is all the instruction. <span class="Italic">Kuruṣva mad-arpanam.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Whatever you are doing with your senses..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...<span class="Italic">kaunteya mukta-saṅga samācara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is wanted. The <span class="Italic">māyāvādī</span> philosophers, they are taking because the senses are creating so much trouble, material existence, finish this-<span class="Italic">śūnyavādi.</span> But that will not solve the problem. Problem will be solved that you keep your eyes. You don't require to finish it, but cure it. Just like you medical man. If one is blind out of cataract, you don't say that you pluck it, the eye, and throw it. No. "Please cure it and you'll be able to see." This is the difference between <span class="Italic">māyāvādī</span> philosopher and Vaiṣṇava philosopher. They want to pluck it out, make it zero, <span class="Italic">śūnyavāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūnyavāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is the philosophy. <span class="Italic">Śūnyavādī</span> means they want to make it zero. Your are troubling, you have got so much trouble with your eyes: don't bother, pluck it out! This is their philosophy. And our philosophy is, "No, there is no need of plucking out. Just cure it and you'll see." That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what the <span class="Italic">Kaṭhopaniṣad</span> teaches us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every Vedic scripture will advise you. You take this <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span> or that <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad</span>; the ultimate is <span class="Italic">Gitopaniṣad.</span> The final, <span class="Italic">Gitopaniṣad.</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, yes. That is always mentioned after each of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">Gitopanisad.</span> So <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is the substance and summary of all <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> and <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> means <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> That is the Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> But if you negate "I," there's no question of seeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> If you negate the "I..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same principle, that "You are seeing. Now kill yourself: you don't see." That's all. The same philosophy. You are seeing and feeling disturbance-better kill yourself; you'll not see, then all problems solved. This is their advise. Kill yourself. So who will agree to that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, philosophically kill yourself, and get yourself transferred to a different life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean not physically, I mean as a philosophical point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Kill" means you finish yourself, no more seeing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Finish your present ego...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your interpretation. Killing means finish everything. Killing does not mean that you will again see. There is not killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> But you'll just go in another body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is curing. Killing and curing. If you kill yourself, then whole thing is finished. But if you cure yourself, then you see rightly. So we advise cure, not kill. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You mean cure the ego. Cure the ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Cure the disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...ego is the disease. First disease man is overtaken by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> False ego, you can say false ego. "I exist"; this is pure ego. I exist, that's a fact, and when we say "I exist for this life, I can finish it, there is no next life," that is not pure ego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That should be the ego of God or the ego of you. (Sanskrit) Whether God's ego or your ego, there cannot be two egos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sama hi, sama hi.</span> You are already <span class="Italic">sama hi. Sarvam kalv idam brahma.</span> You are already in Brahman. There is no question of <span class="Italic">samai.</span> The rascal cannot see. They say <span class="Italic">samai.</span> Why <span class="Italic">samai</span>? You are already there. You do not know. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, brahma-bhūta prasannātmā.</span> I am already here, <span class="Italic">prasannātmā.</span> If you have the false impression that "I am out of <span class="Italic">brahman,</span>" that is, there is question of <span class="Italic">samai.</span> But if you know that you are already in <span class="Italic">brahman,</span> then where is the question of <span class="Italic">samai</span>? <span class="Italic">Prasannātmā.</span> This is real explanation. <span class="Italic">Brahm-bhuta prasannātmā.</span> Now we understand that I am <span class="Italic">aha brahmāsmi.</span> That is real knowledge. I am not this body, I am not American, I am not Indian. <span class="Italic">Aha brahmāsmi...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "I am not this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that is real knowledge. But they are under the impression of this false knowledge. Therefore it is <span class="Italic">samai.</span> Why <span class="Italic">samai</span>? You are already there. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁso jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the sun is there, the sunshine is also there. Always. So you are sunshine and Kṛṣṇa is sun, so we are already together. But the cloud is there. We are thinking "I am not sunshine; I am cloud." That is misconception. But when we understand that the cloud is no more there, then <span class="Italic">aha brahmāsmi. Brahm-bhūta prasannātmā.</span> That is wanted. Under the fool's guidance you are becoming fool. And if we take the real guidance, then we come into the real knowledge. We have created a fool's paradise. Everyone is a fool, and he is promising paradise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is called living under (indistinct)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. Otherwise why there are so many rascals? (indistinct) The fools make it a fool's paradise. Take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Everything's all right. There is no question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is <span class="Italic">duratyayā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then, <span class="Italic">mām eva...</span> Why don't you surrender? <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will not disturb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi aside to someone) Sir, then, <span class="Italic">sama sarveṣu bhūteṣu mad-bhakti labhate parām.</span> In your, I mean... That is the highest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that you can say when you are yourself <span class="Italic">brahma bhūta [SB 4.30.20].</span> But if you are not <span class="Italic">brahma bhuta,</span> that is not possible. They are trying to unite everyone in the United Nations, all cats and dogs. They are simply barking. There is no possibility of unity. That is not possible. They'll simply go on barking. And it is an association of dogs barking. That's all. So if you keep them dogs, there is no question of unity. If you bring them to <span class="Italic">brahman</span> consciousness, <span class="Italic">aha brahmāsmi,</span> then there will be unity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is that <span class="Italic">sama sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And then when you are in that stage, then you can become qualified to serve God. <span class="Italic">Mad-bhakti labhate parām.</span> So <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is not so easy. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇā sahareṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is more difficult than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not difficult, but because they are rascals, they made it difficult. Kṛṣṇa says, "Immediately." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām eka śaraṇa vraja aha tvā sarva-pāpebhyo</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I'll give you protection-immediately, within a second." But they'll not do that. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says that it is so easy that you can become immediately <span class="Italic">brahma bhuta.</span> Why you should waste time, many, many lives, to come to this conclusion that <span class="Italic">vāsudeva sarvam iti sa mahātm sudurlabhaḥ</span>? Why you should waste your time, many lives? Do it immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, we must have wasted our many lives in past, and we have come to this stage, who knows how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, we have come to this stage, we are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You do it, now. Why you are delaying? If after many, many births I have come to this conclusion, surrender to Kṛṣṇa, why don't you do it now? That is intelligence. (Hindi about rupees) How rascal he is! (Hindi joke) (laughter) Kṛṣṇa says, "You give up all your duties and just come to Me. Immediately." (Hindi) These boys, they did it! That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We are grateful, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! Yes... (Hindi) No, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the nicest movement. Only intelligent man can take it. It is a fact. It is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Maybe (Hindi).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fools, there are all fools; otherwise why the movement is there? The movement is there for correcting the fools. Otherwise there is no need of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So many fools are corrected... (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa! (Hindi conversation with passerby)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One of the renowned poet of Gujarat. His house is right next to the main temple in Dvārakā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was one devotee, he, some Queen or somebody, she was approached by somebody, that two poets are come... Ah, Kalidāsa, yes. "Kalidāsa poet has come to see you." So she immediately said, "I know only two poets, Vyāsadeva and Valmikī, and all other poets I kick out!"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I know only two poets." So she refused to see Kalidāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> One Gosvāmi refused to see Mīrābai, and then she said that "There are only be men at the <span class="Italic">bhajana,</span> not that... Kṛṣṇa is the only man..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thing is, we don't find any authoritative scripture that Mīrābai ever met Rūpa Gosvāmī, but they say like that in Vṛndāvana. But from the life of Rūpa Gosvāmī, we understand that the Gosvāmīs were so popular in Vṛndāvana that if there was any family quarrel, husband and wife, they used to come to Rūpa Gosvāmi to settle up, and automatically he would give the decision, and they would settle up. So how it is possible that he did not see any woman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He did not, ah, Rūpa Gosvāmi or Jīva Gosvāmī, some other Gosvāmī, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> It was Jīva Gosvāmī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jīva Gosvāmī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why Jīva Gosvāmi should not see woman? That is also doubtful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He, he did see Mīrābai.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu also never refused to see woman. But womans were offering respect from a distance, that's all. Not very near. But we don't see that He refused to see woman. Why the Goswamis will do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the story going round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then <span class="Italic">paṇḍitā sama-darśinaḥ.</span> How it is possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> There's that story of the one woman who was on His shoulder, on that (sic:) Nṛsiṁha column looking at Lord Jagannātha, and Govinda tried to take her down and Lord Caitanya said no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One woman, out of her eagerness to see Jagannātha, there was big crowd, she jumped up over the shoulder of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and the devotees said, (in an urgent whisper:) "Come on, come on down. What you are doing?" Caitanya: "No, she is so eager to see Jagannātha. Don't disturb. Don't disturb. Let her stand on My shoulder." So there is no question of hating woman. We want simply devotee. That's all. But unless we are very advanced, we take precaution. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Man is very (indistinct) <span class="Italic">grahi</span>. Mind... I mean Arjuna was told by Bhagavān in sixth <span class="Italic">ajya,</span> "Mind is so difficult to control..." (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He says that "My mind is disturbed even by seeing a wooden doll of a woman." So that is also there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean the Vaiṣṇavas, sir, <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> they are not expected to look at the pictures of women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not... Then how Caitanya Mahāprabhu allowed the woman to stand on His shoulder?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He is, was a <span class="Italic">mahaprabhu.</span> Not for us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is the criterion, that if one is perfect devotee, then it is all right. And so long he is not or she is not perfect devotee, then there is restriction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> stage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...it is the <span class="Italic">sādhana,</span> completely <span class="Italic">sādhana</span> (Hindi), then he is, everything is... <span class="Italic">Sama sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarve sameṣu bhūteṣu.</span> We are not <span class="Italic">sarve sama</span> as yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it depends on the condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is said that they are not only look at the female dolls, or even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is moral instruction. That is moral instruction. Even if you are not a devotee, you should not think of these things. That is the moral instruction. The <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> if he thinks of woman, that is also retricted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But in eight ways he must observe <span class="Italic">brahmācārya.</span> Eight ways. All the five senses and the three..., mind (Sanskrit).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> 7.10 a.m.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall return. (short discussion of actual time)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is 7.20 a.m. You are airport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Airport time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Airport time is wrong. Every clock is very different time there. Each one has its own standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some time back when I was a young boy, I went to see a football match in Calcutta. So after finishing, I came walking through the Bentink Street. So I saw one time in the beginning, and I came to my house, some watch, and clock is giving the same time. (pause) We are giving very simple formula: just become Kṛṣṇa conscious and all problems will be solved. All problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Very easy formula for all the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Like us. (laughs raucously)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Doctor is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Before you came here... You can say anything...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is intelligence. This is not <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span>; this is intelligence. <span class="Italic">Guru mora mūrkha dekhi' koril śāsana.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that "My <span class="Italic">Guru Mahārāja</span> saw Me a fool number one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So you see me also that way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That means He is intelligent. Caitanya Mahāprabhu was not a fool, that's a fact, but He presented Himself like that. He is most learned, but He presented before guru, "I am useless, worthless." <span class="Italic">Tṛṇād api sunīcena...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I myself, sir, we are all (indistinct) not like you, we are worthless, we people. Unless you understand your worth... We are really worthless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very good. /<span class="Italic">Tṛṇad api sunīcena/ taror api sahiṣṇunā/ amānin mānadena/ kīrtanīya sad hariḥ</span>. That is the qualification for chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Humbler than the grass, tolerant than the tree, giving all respect to others, expecting no respect for oneself. These are the qualifications to become perfectly Kṛṣṇa conscious. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam ahiṁs kṣāntir ārjavam. Amanitva.</span> Although he is very qualified, he says "No, no, no. I have no qualification." <span class="Italic">Amanitvam.</span> This is <span class="Italic">amānitvam.</span> (aside to passerby:) Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> This is the beginning of knowledge. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam ahims kṣāntir ārjavam.</span> The materialistic, everyone, they're not <span class="Italic">amānitvam,</span> our, "I'm so respectful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not "I have done this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I don't say. This is the philosophy. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam.</span> Where is that thing? That is taught from the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī. Brahmacārī,</span> a small boy, he is taught that you become <span class="Italic">amānitvam adambhitvam,</span> and he accepts it. Because he is small, the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> he may becoming from a king's family, but if he's ordered, "My dear boy, take my shoes and brush it," he'll do it, because he's innocent boy. He learns. Therefore <span class="Italic">brahmacār gurukule vasan dānta.</span> The mode of life should be trained from the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This British public school, sir, they are doing that. The school of Harrow and the Eaton. The first-standard boys have to brush the shoes of the fifth-standard boys, and the fifth to the sixth, and the sixth to the seventh, and first to the second...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And the first boy, his shoes goes to the teacher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some idea...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is great idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is also imperfect. Anyway, it is something. <span class="Italic">Amānitvam adambhitvam:</span> they from the very beginning of their life, they address other's wife as "mother," you see? <span class="Italic">Matrvat paridaresu.</span> This is culture, to see every woman except his own wife as mother. Where is that culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> Mahātm Gandhi also changed his life after <span class="Italic">brahmacārī...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> Mahātm Gandhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are talking of real <span class="Italic">mahātmās,</span> not politicians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> No, no. He was changing after <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> his life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He took a big vow. He took a big vow at the age of forty-three years. That <span class="Italic">mahan, mah-vrata,</span> what they call it? For not indulging in sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is one of the qualification...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is one of them. But by controlling their sex, people derive much (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because I think woman is the personification of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You can say that way. The whole thing is revolving round that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you become strong, Kṛṣṇa conscious, it may go away. <span class="Italic">māyām etam taranti te:</span> there is no more <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We must be conscious like Mīrābai or <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> or big, I mean, like (indistinct). When his wife died he said (Hindi), "I will be able to worship God a better way," when he lost his wife. These are the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that means he became Kṛṣṇa conscious after his wife was dead. (laughing) Not before!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, that is a saying, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should I expect the death of my wife?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, his wife died, and he accepted that way. He was not expecting. We are all dead so far as we are Kṛṣṇa conscious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhīra</span> means in spite of presence of agitation, if one is not agitated, that is <span class="Italic">dhira.</span> And if I pray that "Here is the cause of agitation. Let her die," that is not very good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, after she died. You have misunderstood me, sir. You are, you are... Even a great <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span>, a great Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> and I mean I, I don't think he would... He would say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should I pray for somebody's death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He never prayed for her to die. (everyone laughing) He prayed that because now he will have less hindrance in the worship of God. That is what he meant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is God conscious. Vaiṣṇava, <span class="Italic">vāñch-kalpa-tarubhya ca krp-sindhubhya eva ca.</span> Vaiṣṇava is an ocean of mercy. Why he should, we should expect another death...? No, no, I'm saying... Nobody, no Vaiṣṇava aspires or thinks that "He may be hampered or he may be harmed for my benefit." No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What he says, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I am not argument about him. I mean to say, Vaiṣṇava means <span class="Italic">para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span> Vaiṣṇava should be always <span class="Italic">duḥkhī</span> for others. Vaiṣṇava personally, he has no <span class="Italic">duḥkha.</span> That is Prahlāda Mahārāja says, <span class="Italic">naivodhvije para duratyay vaitaranyas tvad-viya-gayana-mahamrta-magna-cittaḥ, soce tato vimukh-cetasa.</span> They are simply anxious for the persons who are godless. That is their... Even they are godless, even they are enemy of the devotee, still Vaiṣṇava thinks, "How I can correct him?" Not that "He's my enemy. Let him die." "How I shall correct him?" That is Vaiṣṇava, <span class="Italic">para-duḥkha-duḥkhī.</span> He is under ignorance, he is talking nonsense-"How shall I correct him?" That is missionary spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Ten minutes. 7.10.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can go. It is very nice movement... (noise) They have paid already some <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Ashoka</span> gave three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> previously for Vṛndāvana. He said he wants to give more to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...he's devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He said he enjoyed the program very much also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Ashoka</span> did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Accha?</span> <span class="Italic">Ashoka</span>'s mother said also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, he also, when we were taking dinner, he came up and he said he enjoyed it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they did not put any questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes. It is very difficult to put question to you. (Prabhupāda laughs) You mow the opposition down very badly. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is all Kṛṣṇa's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am a shameless man to give questions... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How long did I speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikesa:</span> Hm, about forty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my standard. (Hindi exchange)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> In that Birla house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Birla house? Huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The program was in the garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> I was there, in that Birla house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You were in Bombay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> Yes, in that last room, on that other side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...once. Kīrtanānanda Swami has come, he reported that sometimes these European and Americans, they do not like our version, and sometimes they purchase and tear the books, hm? And still they purchase! (laughs) That is the beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Europeans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. In America. Kīrtanānanda was saying. They tear these pages, and again still they purchase. This example is given. Just like hot sugarcane juice. Because it is hot, it cannot be taken. But one cannot avoid tasting it. (laughter) Sugarcane juice hot. Because we speak everything against their so-called knowledge, and still they want to taste it. Hot sugarcane juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Your this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> commentary is really wonderful. I am critically studying now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Second reading of mine. On the first reading I just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they read our books for the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But you have collected from, I mean, two, three, four or five...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dimmock said that "Here is the commentation who has practiced devotion in his life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I mean, those who are research scholars, they can write down better about their work if... If I write down about the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He cannot write the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...write down that way. Because you have done it, you can do it better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our mission. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācār prabhu jīver śikhāmu.</span> First of all you behave yourself, then teach. Without being accomplished in your life, don't teach. Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement was that. <span class="Italic">Āpani ācār prabhu jīver śikhāmu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You teach by your action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...<span class="Italic">alpa citte bahu kori mane.</span> This is the warning of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The Vaiṣṇavas, I mean teaching is that the Vaiṣṇavas should not see any faults in the <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> or the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> Just look at the good side, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That, you may do that. But that is not a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Sannyāsī</span> is smoking cigarette, drinking tea,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then they are not <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. (Hindi about Pāgala Bāb in Vṛndāvana) Hm, who goes there? No gentleman goes there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So many people say (Hindi) about these American boys smoking their hashish, their LSD. They are smoking all sorts of things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have learned from India. The American hippies, they have learned from these so-called rascals. Yes. Ginsberg, he introduced this. He came to India, went to Haridwar, he saw so many rascals, <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> smoking <span class="Italic">gañjā.</span> He thought, "This is the way..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Acchā. Celo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, (Hindi). Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Same thing-our boys have started smoking LSD in the colleges here. Yes, yes. In Grand(?) Medical College boys have started smoking. They know very well that it is a bad thing, medical students. Never bother the arts and science schools. (Hindi) Because their ideal starts from American precedent. The last precedent (president?) was so idealistic, so... (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> A few days back in the newspapers there was..., smoking causes damage to the brain...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It causes damage everywhere, because it damages your blood vessel which carries the vital fluid to all the organs. The blood vessels are spoiled and narrowed down so not sufficient amount of blood will get to your brain, to your heart, to your lungs, your everything practically. Follow? This is not one of (indistinct). They smoke this <span class="Italic">ganja,</span> sir, because artificially they go into a sort of a trance. That is what the psychedelic drugs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That man also says like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Psychedelic drugs. I mean I read about these psychedelic drugs, and then, you see, this artificial trance, no doubt, that is much different from the <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> that you get. But they, that is why they are tempted to do it. Same with the LSD. That means they find some sort of a pleasure in it. <span class="Italic">Sādhus</span> get pleasure in <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> they get this artificial <span class="Italic">samādhi</span> by drugs. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sādhu,</span> they take pleasure in real happiness. <span class="Italic">Satyanandi. Rāmante yoginam ante satyananda.</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">satya,</span> so how they will take pleasure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They are <span class="Italic">ātmārāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Para satya dhīmahi.</span> They do not know what is <span class="Italic">para satyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Temporarily they get this <span class="Italic">param satyam</span>... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yogi</span> means <span class="Italic">satyānanda...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi about temporary pleasure) They go down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The whole, I mean, Japan was practically done, I mean, done to practical death by this opium smoking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In China also. The Britishers, they were taking opium from India and selling there and making money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And now Chinese leaders were rejoicing that American boys smoking LSD. (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Saurabha, you have brought these logs from Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they are lying idle?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They are not ours, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why it was brought here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> They will be used for the temple. They will be used for the scaffolding. For those high things. Because otherwise we have to cut them, and it's very waste of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> If we cut them...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not cutting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. These poles, they all set in size about nine feet. You notice they're about fifteen to eighteen feet. So we use them only for the scaffolding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) ...anyhow, they have done it very quickly. Our engineers could not have done it so quickly as that. You are quite fast. And the structure is very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughter) I say they are quite slow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, but it takes its own time for curing and all these things. How can an engineer accelerate that natural process? And that structure is really extremely strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We want to see the temple also. (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span>) (end)</div>
