<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...modern buildings. And they're very frustrated here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They're becoming very violent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education means producing rogues. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> "...houses. Our houses are too expensive." It's a big problem everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do they not go outside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> The problem is in the cities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Rascals, they want to live in city and drink wine and eat meat. So there must be problems. This civilization is simply to create problems, <span class="Italic">anartha. Anartha. Anartha</span> means unnecessarily problems. So these rascals, they do not know how to solve it. But the solution is this <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>lokasyājānato vidvāṁś<br class="calibre2"/>cakre sātvata-saṁhitām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.7.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">These <span class="Italic">anarthas,</span> problems, they have created under the influence of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So if you want to solve it, you take to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> <span class="Italic">Anarthopaśamam.</span> Directly it will be solved, directly. <span class="Italic">Anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam, lokasya ajānataḥ.</span> The rascals, they do not know. Therefore <span class="Italic">vidvān,</span> Vyāsadeva, the most learned, <span class="Italic">vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām,</span> he has done this <span class="Italic">sātvata,</span> Vaiṣṇava literature, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> That is the only solution. These rascals, they have created problems. Therefore we have started this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for their benefit. Let them cooperate, and we shall make solution of all problems-political, social, everything. Let them come and cooperate. (pause) They are not agreeable to close the slaughterhouse? Yesterday, you were not present when that mayor came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> I was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I requested that "You are one of the important men. Why don't you agree? Close the slaughterhouse. If you want to eat meat, take it when the cow is dead. We shall supply you?" What is their objection? What is the possible objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Objection is that the people have become so impatient for sense gratification, they have no patience anymore. They can't wait... There was some story. In the United States, there has been this trouble with petrol, and... All over the world, there's been this trouble with petrol, gasoline. So there was rationing. That means people could only get a little gas. So the cars would line up for a great distance in the gas station, and they'd wait for a long time. And sometimes the gas station would run out of gas. And the people would get so angry that they killed the gas station attendant. [break] ...does not teach anyone to be austere or patient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But human life is meant for austere and patience. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Austerity, penance, that is human life. Otherwise, it is animal life. Simply animal civilization. It is not human civilization. Hare Kṛṣṇa... (car is in gas station, conversation in car about how much gas to get, etc.) [break] ...progressing, they stand their own position, as they are made by nature. Therefore there is no criminality. They are under full control of nature. We are also under full control of nature, but we have been given little concession: to cultivate spiritual knowledge. So that intelligence, extra intelligence, what we have got, instead of cultivating spiritual knowledge, we are using in the same process of sense gratification like the animals. And this, this business, this, means animalistic business in a polished way, is going on as civilization. Actually, it is animalistic. But it is little decorated or polished, and they have accepted, "This is civilization." In other words, they do not know what is human civilization. They do not know. They're animals. They do not know. Hare Kṛṣṇa... (about getting gas:) For this service, they do charge anything? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> No. (more conversation with gas station attendant, etc.) [break] It is very known that the family is very strong, the family attachment is very strong. In America, people separate from the family very early. And in France, the family attachment is so strong. And many people, many families have come and asked us if we will be able to open school here for their children too. The interest is there. Everyone is afraid of this present system of schooling. Because they send their children there, and they come back so crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rogues. Rogues. After education, they are rogues only (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> ...take breakfast a little earlier. Is that O.K? And then this other gentleman can come with us and we can go faster that way. Because their truck is slow. [break] ...human being, those who have system of religion? Is that what makes them civilized? So the society today, even though it seems to be technologically advanced, can that society be called civilized? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long technological advancement is meant for bodily comforts, so, so long one remains in the bodily concept of life, he's animal. (pause) (end)</div>
