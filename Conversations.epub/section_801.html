<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdāyānanda:</span> ...puffed up with knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their knowledge, nonsense? He has know...? Have they knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> They're trying to prove that sense gratification is bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> ...and the explanation of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And where is sense gratification? As soon as nature kicks you out, where is your sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdāyānanda:</span> It's a relative thing. Actually, compared to the ordinary man, he's much more intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is intelligence?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdāyānanda:</span> He's thinking that "I know so many things, and these other people, they don't know these things. Therefore I'm better than them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the birds and beasts, they know better than you many things. There are many birds and beasts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "They can't... They can't explain it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "They can't explain it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You also cannot explain. What is explaining? All nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "Well, I can explain."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Perhaps." "Might be." "It was like this and that..." What is that explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Well, the common man doesn't challenge that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mean common men are fool. But why we should accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> If they could really explain it, so many things would not be going wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> If they could actually explain it, so many things would not be going wrong. The thing is, their explanation causes more problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But they say that..., When we say that everything is done by Kṛṣṇa, they say that's also "perhaps, maybe." They don't see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we have got evidence. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have got evidence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> As we don't accept theirs, they don't accept ours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't accept... You don't... Why shall I accept you? You don't accept me, I don't accept you. Why you become authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then they say "Finished. Get out."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, my question is that "Why they become atheists, a little knowledge, so-called scientists?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They have to become atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They have to become atheist. If they don't become atheists, then they can't play their games anymore. The idea of their research finishes as soon as you admit that there is God. But if you say, "There's no God," then they can research. It was explained that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can continue to befool you, that, and take money. And as soon as you don't give them money, there is no research. Then they starve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We've seen, though, from examples in the Vedic literatures like Viśvakarma and Āyur Vedic medicine, that it's possible to engage in architecture, medicine, such activities, without being atheistic. So it must not simply be that they're scientists, but that they're actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> The actual motive is to fill the belly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Moghāśā mogha-karmanaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Actually they're envious, because they say that "There is no Supreme Person controlling," but then, on the other hand, they want to become the supreme person controlling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> So it's just a matter of envy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who was that demon? He got some benediction from Lord Śiva. [break] Anyone he touched, his head would fall off, but he wanted to use it against Lord Śiva. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When one is jealous of God, then gradually jealous of everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jealousy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jealousy, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpananda:</span> So then, if I'm jealous of others, it's really just a reflection of my jealousy of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Siddha-svarūpananda:</span> And if I am angry at others, it's because I'm angry at Kṛṣṇa also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything begins from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ sarvam pravartate.</span> Where is your other friend? Oh, here he is!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śiva-jvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. [break] "<span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda. <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span>" (laughs) They'll not touch unless I give, and they are satisfied, even one grain. That is... They don't want more, that "Give me more." No. But constantly. [break] Make folded hand. Yes. Sometimes he'll press like that, eh, to show me that I am dying. They make quick friends with old men. [break] ...a few <span class="Italic">katias</span>(?), that is very easy. You assort the <span class="Italic">katias.</span> You go and place, daytime. And nightime, take a <span class="Italic">katia</span> and spread anywhere, and you can see. Indian system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Cots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cot. Mass of cot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> With rope.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With rope. That's all. Small. You can keep fifty, sixty. So keep it in one place. And at night take one, and anywhere you can sleep. Very easy. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Children:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...ṣata-doltena malenatvaṁ na muñcyati.</span>(?) If you take a coal and wash it, one who has... Still black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> And he does not allow himself to be washed. He never comes to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If he... A coal, however you go on with soap and other things, go on washing, it will never become clean. <span class="Italic">Aṅgarasya śata-doltena malenatvaṁ na muyati.</span>(?) What is the defect? Why the...? The window is becoming black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> The lids are... We purchased some new lids yesterday. The lids have been damaged. Therefore the smoke is leaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why damage cannot be repaired?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> No, we purchased yesterday. They're going to install today. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> ...has painted for your books. So he must be fairly good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he has painted for my books, then he should be first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> He says he'll finish the one painting in five days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't matter they take five days or ten days. It must be done very nicely. [break] (children yelling, etc.) Hm. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> [break] ...attached to his hair. He will give it up if you tell him. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has to voluntarily do it. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
