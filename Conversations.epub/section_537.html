<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...names of Kṛṣṇa as the spiritual master or the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have chanted them, but sometimes I'll hear that our devotees will be chanting Kṛṣṇa's name in different ways that I haven't heard, in <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow what you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Just like sometimes we'll hear our men. They'll be chanting... Like yesterday I heard that someone was chanting, "Nitāi-Gaura, Nitāi-Gaura, Nitāi-Nitāi-Gaura." Like that, I'll hear different <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> Someone is chanting: "Rādhe, Rādhe, Rādhe, Rādhe," like that, at <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is not done by the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> But there is no harm chanting "Rādhe." But sometimes it is degraded to make something new, invention. Therefore better to stick to "Hare Kṛṣṇa" and to "Śrī-Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Prabhupāda-Nityānanda." Otherwise... Just like the <span class="Italic">sahajiyās,</span> they have invented: "Nitāi-Gaura Rādhe Śyāma, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Rāma." These things will come gradually. But they are not approved. They are called <span class="Italic">chara kīrtana</span> (?), means "concocted <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span>" But there is no harm chanting "Rādhe, Nitāi-Gaura." So better stick to this Pañca-tattva, and <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Just like "Nitāi Gaura Rādhe Śyāma, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Rāma." There is "Nitāi-Gaura, Rādhe Śyāma," but it is not approved. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to follow the <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> In <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> you'll find "Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-Caitanya Prabhu-Nityānanda, Śrī-Advaita Gadādhara...," never "Nitāi Gaura, Rādhe Śyāma." So why should we do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> The concocter of the "Nitāi Gaura Rādhe Śyāma," previously he was a follower of Bhaktisiddhānta, but then he was rejected, and then he started his own camp.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, yes, he was meeting Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura. So... What is called? Carana dāsa Bābājī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometimes during <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> many bona fide <span class="Italic">bhajanas</span> are sung, but not much Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is that not a good tendency, that maybe just two or three minutes of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and many other <span class="Italic">bhajanas?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We should stick to Hare Kṛṣṇa. Śrī-Kṛṣṇa-Caitanya Prabhu-Nityānanda, <span class="Italic">jīva jāgo jīva jāgo...,</span> these are authorized. But Hare Kṛṣṇa is the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> What is sung by <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura, Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, that can be sung. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> ...you say is back to Godhead. But when one is situated in pure, transcendental love of Kṛṣṇa, then that's, then wherever he may be, that's back to Godhead. Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> So then we should desire not to go back to Vaikuṇṭha but to go back to..., to be situated in our pure service to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Pure devotee does not aspire anything, simply to be engaged in loving service of the Lord, wherever it may be. It doesn't matter. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...they know everything and they're perfect in everything. But sometimes, from our material viewpoint, we see some discrepancies. Just like we think that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because material viewpoint. The viewpoint is wrong; therefore you find discrepancies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> So we should think that we have the defect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is explained, <span class="Italic">bhakti-saṁsanaḥ:</span> "One who's preaching the cult of devotional service, he's <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span>" Then why should you find any discrepancy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Because we see... For instance, sometimes the <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> may seem to forget something or not to know something, so from our point of view, if someone has forgotten, that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. Then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...an imperfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not the... Then you do not understand. <span class="Italic">Ācārya</span> is not God, omniscient. He is servant of God. His business is to preach <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult. That is <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> And that is the perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the perfection. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> So we have a misunderstanding about what perfection is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Perfection is here, how he is preaching <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> cult. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there's also a question of reciprocation. You have so many disciples, thousands, and one devotee was asking me yesterday, "How does... I want to please Śrīla Prabhupāda. How does he know my progress and my service because I'm..., when I'm so far away from him and if I don't write him?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So his representatives are there, the president, the GBC. They will see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mādhavānanda:</span> The representatives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> The representative may be there, but what is my personal relationship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? To obey your spiritual master. Whatever he has said, you follow strictly. Follow the regulative principles. Chant sixteen rounds. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda, when Śrīla Vyāsadeva was lamenting after compiling so many Vedic literatures before compiling <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam,</span> he said to his spiritual master, Nārada Muni, that "You please enter within me and find out my deficiency. You are as good as the all-pervading Supersoul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is always the position of spiritual master, to find out the deficiency in the character of his disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He said that "You are as good as the all-pervading Supersoul."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He... He pointed out the deficiency, that "You have not described so elaborately about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You have touched only the social, religious, political point of views." That was his deficiency. So a disciple is always in deficiency before his spiritual master. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">guru more murkha dekhi karila śāśana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc.</i> <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 7.71]<span class="Italic">.</span> "My spiritual master saw Me a fool number one. Therefore he has chastised Me." So disciple should be always ready to be chastised. He should not think that he has become perfect. That is perfection. So long he thinks that he is not perfect-he's to be chastised-then he's perfect. And as soon as he thinks that he has become perfect, he's nonsense immediately, nonsense number one. [Break] ...always to be chastised by the spiritual master for perfection. And if he thinks that now he has become perfect, then he's a foolish. Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">guru more murkha dekhi.</span> "My spiritual master saw Me a fool number one." Was He fool number one? He's God Himself. But that is the position. He should remain always a fool number one, ready to be chastised. Then he's perfect. In the moral instruction, Cāṇakya Paṇḍita gives this instruction, that <span class="Italic">lālane bahavo doṣas tadane bahavo guṇaḥ:</span> "If you chastise your son or disciple, he'll improve, and if you say, 'Oh, you are all right,' then he'll degrade." <span class="Italic">Tasmāt putraṁ ca śiṣyaṁ ca tāḍayet na tu lalayet:</span> "Therefore you always chastise your son and disciple. Never flat..." What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Flatter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Prabhupāda, in one purport in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you write that a disciple of a bona fide spiritual master is supposed to know everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if he follows the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But how could he know...? What does that mean, "everything"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything means whatever his guru knows, he should know, that much. Not like God, everything. Within his limit, that's all. If he tries to understand whatever his guru has said, that much is "everything." Otherwise, "everything" does not mean that we know everything, like God, like Kṛṣṇa. That is not possible. If he regularly chants and follow the regulative principles, follows the orders of guru, then he knows everything. That's all. Not very much... Knows everything, then what is the use of reading books when he knows everything? [break] ...everything-except Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Aham... Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> He knows past, present, future, everything. You cannot expect anyone to know like Kṛṣṇa, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that one who knows Him knows everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because if he knows that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then he knows everything. That's all. Not that he should know as Kṛṣṇa. If he... <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam eva vijñātam...</span> If he accepts Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Absolute Truth, then he knows everything. That is finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That knowledge itself is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> That knowledge itself is complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> There may be material things he doesn't know, but they're useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If there's some material information that such a person doesn't know, that's not really knowledge anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I did not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> If he doesn't know how many people live in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Just like Gaura-kiśora could not write. So it appeared that he did not, there was something that he did not know, although he knew Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He knows everything. Otherwise how Bhaktisiddhānta accepted him as guru? He knows Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinī-kānta:</span> Whatever the spiritual master says, that is also perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he says nothing concocted. Whatever he says, he says from <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> and guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, is there any instance when you were chastised by your spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Is there any instance when you were chastised by your spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Can you tell us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I remember the moment was very valuable. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Can you tell us the story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think I have said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> When you were speaking to one man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He became very angry and chastised me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagajīvana:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, was this during a lecture by Śrīla Bhaktisiddhānta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagajīvana:</span> Was this during a lecture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was not... One of my old brother, he, he wanted to speak something. So I leaned my... I immediately became... (laughter) So he chastised him more than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> When Lord Caitanya chastised someone more than Advaita Ācārya, Advaita felt that He had been neglected 'cause he had not received a greater chastisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wanted to be chastised, so Caitanya fulfilled His desire. (end)</div>
