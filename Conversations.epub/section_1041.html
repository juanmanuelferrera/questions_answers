<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "The Baba personifies heaven." (?) (Him?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. He said, "Baba personifies this philosophy, that God in man and man in God is the basis of religion. As he told me, "God is man and man is God. All of us have something of God, the divine spark, within us. All men are divine like myself, with the spirit embodied in human flesh and bone. The only difference is that they are unaware of this Godhood."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unaware. So God, how he's unaware? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They make God so cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is... And then the next part's even worse. "For the doubting or confused minority, to which section I then belonged, Swamiji has this message. "Those who want to secure pearls from the sea have to dive deep to fetch them. It does not help them to dabble among the shallow waves near the shore and say that the sea has no pearls and that all stories about them are false. Likewise, if a person wants to secure the love and grace of the <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> he must also dive deep and get submerged in Sai Baba. Then only will he become one with me and carry me in his innermost heart."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone can say like that. What you have done as God? God is an Indian. Making things very complicated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, and this man goes on to describe the aura. He goes on to describe how spiritual his presence is. They chant <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span> They chant <span class="Italic">oṁkāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, anything about us? He criticized "God is an Indian," that is a criticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, no. This is a glorification. He's a nationalist; so he's saying God is an Indian. 'Cause it's supposed to be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How God can be Indian? Then how he's God? God must be for everyone. An Indian God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He says here that he is the image of Kṛṣṇa incarnate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He says, "They say that he's Śiva and Pārvatī combined together. He certainly embodies both masculinity and femininity. Kṛṣṇa, as we read of Him in the scriptures, must have resembled Swamiji. His walk is that of a dancer floating in a graceful movement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. I will take rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want to keep this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. (break-moves to garden)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're all <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs.</span> He was just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> I was just underlining that thing and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you write. I've already told you. I cannot speak now. You write. I have given you already hints.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Avyaktaṁ vyaktim āpannam.</span> He says, "I come from the formless." But Kṛṣṇa says anyone who says that is <span class="Italic">abuddhayaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Besides that, He says in another place that as they pass through our existence... [break] ...in future we shall continue, then when he becomes <span class="Italic">avyakta?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes. Past existence he was, future existence he will be when he becomes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Past, present, future, there are three times. So if every time he is person, when he becomes imperson?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And this thing about God is an Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And God is an Indian, that is also rascaldom. He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ yāḥ, ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> So how He's Indian? Throughout the whole universe, as many forms of body are there, He is the father. So how he is Indian? If the father is Indian, then the son is also Indian. So father is not Indian, so how the God can be Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tanum āśritam.</span> This concept of Indian, European is there because you are a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Just directly charge him. Directly. That "You are a <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> you are a rascal," immediately. Let him speak. And send it to the newspaper that this letter we have sent challenging this rascal, let him reply. If he does not reply, silent, that means he's accepts he's a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, because Blitz has taken up to advertise that he's God, so now they should accept challenge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He said self-realization is God-realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are not self-realized. You are madman, rascal. How you can be self-realized? A madman cannot be self-realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. And if he was Kṛṣṇa before, how is it he's disagreeing with what the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā </span>says?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not Kṛṣṇa. Because if you were Kṛṣṇa, then how you can be a rascal? Kṛṣṇa is not a rascal. (end)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> ...in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So first of all finish your construction. Then you go to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> (indistinct), they carving the wood and everything, the shape of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, we shall bring priests from Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Aha. That is the technical thing. But I was speaking regarding the construction because I want to know whether you want to have the bathing ceremony only taking place on the opening day, or also later on the facility can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Only that day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only that day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Then is it necessary to make this special arrangement that this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. The small deities, <span class="Italic">śālagrāma,</span> they are worshiped. And big Deity, they are decorated nicely. No need of worshiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> So only the opening ceremony.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Nitāi had them bathe the big Deities here, Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa, on Janmāṣṭamī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And on Balarāma's appearance day, the big Deities were bathed. Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Terrible speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Actually <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī</span> celebrations were very bad and it's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the color has faded? He is a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I remember that when these Deities... They're never to be washed. Never water was to touch. Supposed to put a plastic bag over the Deity. That was... If you have to use the big Deities, you're supposed to cover them with plastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why did you allow? Just see, this is the disease. Rascals they do not know. And although I was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, but everyone was listening to him. He was posing himself as the most learned in Deity worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he's fond of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He was introducing <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But it doesn't say in <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</span> that you bathe in water marble Deities. It says you're supposed to have a smaller set for bathing. That's in <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> His idea was that we would become the most famous temple for bathing big Deities in Vṛndāvana. This was his idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That bathing is not done on the <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana.</span> The Deity is taken out. Then it is done. But that is very risky. You cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And besides that, the bathing was done by devotees who are not experienced in Deity worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't allow him. This botheration he has gone. He is simply posing himself very learned Sanskrit scholar, above everything. That is his ambition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> And on the opening day the Deities will be on the altar or they will be in front when they're bathed? When the bathing is taking place in Bombay for the opening...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That the priest will arrange who will come from...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes. But they will be on the altar or they will be in front?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. In the front they are left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> So not on the altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But if it is risky, you should not do. Big Deity, we have got big Deity, huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, very heavy. They are very heavy, Rādhā-Rāsabihārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they do in Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Hyderabad the Deity was already installed. There was no need for bathing so they didn't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other Deities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Here, just like here for the opening on <span class="Italic">pratiṣṭhā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, they bathed the small Rādhā and Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, we should not take risk at any rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Rādhā-Rāsabihārī, also, when They came from Akash-Ganga there was a disturbance with Them also. Rādhā has a tendency to crack on the arm. Her left arm cracks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Slightly. There was a very weak, it was very weak. Very weak. I remember 'cause they had to move three times. I was there all the times when They were moved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Bombay. And every time they were very upset because of this left arm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This risk should not be taken at any gain. Never mind <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,</span> this-<span class="Italic">vilāsa</span>-no risk. You must always know. No risk. That is the first point. Then we consult <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa.</span> Nobody can give reference to <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa</span> at risk. No. Not at all. Do? Anything more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Can I ask one question? You were mentioning that you wanted to start local industries, casting Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we can purchase... We can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Purchase raw materials?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, everything is all right now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So I was wondering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you come, there... [break] There are, what is called, Deity makers here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well, most of the Deities, they are cast in Aligarh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aligarh? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes. Then they're brought here and there is, craftsmen, they finish. They polish then they add...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is from Aligarh? You go to we have got a best friend in Aligarh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Surendra Kumar. Surendra Kumar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. He'll get you all those things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He should know everything about that because he's making lots.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And another... Aligarh is the best place. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's the gentleman who was with you last night Śrīla Prabhupāda, Prem Yogi. He has come with his luggage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prem Yogi. So give him that place vacated by the old man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Next to Akṣayānanda's room. Seventeen. Take him up there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually you can just bring him to Bhakti Pradhāna and tell him. Bhakti Pradhāna is the manager of the guest house, so he should take care of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this old man has gone. So give him that place. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I believe there are two men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two men that's all right. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, you just officially receive them. He's got M.A. Ph.D. Good man. This is etiquette.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So, what I wanted to know was that ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Develop that business and give engagement. The women can live here for sewing. They must be comfortably situated. If they are feeling, women, they cannot feel very bad and stay. We do not want that. So they can live here in a room and work sewing. And our women who have learned, they can teach. Very simple. And men must be engaged there for finishing. And if at Aligarh they are casting, then there is no difference. And there is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So the Deity should be cast in Aligarh and then finished here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Just like we are doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Aligarh is 45 miles away. You can go and bring them, and Surendranath will help you. If there are expert men in Aligarh, that will be very nice. A different size Deity, you get there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Six inches, nine inches, twelve, fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And nice Gaura-Nitāi and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. And they'll prepare nice dress and pack in a box and send to our different centers. There are hundred centers. If you can dispatch at least one dozen pairs, you can make business for twelve hundred pairs. It will be very big business. And if they are displayed, people will like to purchase. It will be very good business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Even here. For people coming to our temple, if we have display they will purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We can have our shop here. We are getting so many shops. So one shop Deity and Deity clothes and <span class="Italic">mukuṭas.</span> Just like they have got...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> In Loi Bazaar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> The same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> One shop sweets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Apply business brain, everything I'll have to tell you. You can... Anyone who has got business brain, he can earn any amount of money. That is the... These are all... Incense, Deity, and then <span class="Italic">mukuṭa,</span> then <span class="Italic">tulasī-mālā,</span> then <span class="Italic">karatālas,</span> (indistinct), some <span class="Italic">pañcapātrā.</span> In this way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? This man brought his friend. That room is not big enough for three. So they will have to take another room for two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Friend?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> One friend has come with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That same person from last night, the one wearing white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So the three men cannot live there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's too small.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not so. First of all, give them, then we shall see later on. Why immediately want facilities? Or he can, the other man can go with the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The younger one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes, somebody may go to the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> Just now make them accommodated there, then we shall see what to do. That "First of all you stay here, then we shall see what is convenient to you then."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Because they're in an awful small room. If I put three in that room, that one man who's already there may become upset.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has already gone there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, I mean I know. I've been there. But that one man who's there now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So four men cannot live in that room?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Three men not possible. Because they've got two beds in there. Two of these big huge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At least you provide them two men there and one man with <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> That's all. Not that we can spare so many rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> If I ask that man who's already there to go to the brahmacārīs, he may become offended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you do that. He can go to the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You can give him one of those <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> rooms in the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Arrange everything. But don't turn this, and very easily give the other guest room. Then it will be awkward like anything. Very cautious. So this is the program I am giving, and if you can give some practical sense, it will be very nice profitable business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes. But it will require some capital in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So capital required we can give. There is no scarcity of capital. But it must be consulted between three-Gopāla, Viśvambhara, and yourself. And then if capital is required, how capital you will repay. Make them assured. I shall give you. There is no difficulty. Capital you will have, provided you can make profit. Not that we give capital and never return. That will not be possible. Take any amount of capital, but we must be paid interest as bank gives loan. I can say bank will give you. If I order the bank, bank will give you. So capital there is no question. The question is how you shall utilize it. How you shall make profit. Capital, by the grace of Kṛṣṇa, you can take <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> That I can arrange. The bank, if I say to the bank they will have to give you, or I shall personally give you. There is no question of capital scarcity. So only thing is how will you utilize this capital and how you will make profit. You make that program. So far capital is concerned, there is no concern. You'll get any amount of capital. And you can develop the business. Now we have got credit in the bank, any bank will give you if I say yes. There will be no scarcity of capital.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Aligarh he has got so many friends. Aligarh we have got many friends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Half of my life was spent in Aligarh. (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aligarh is maternal uncle's house. So many relatives. So Aligarh, if the Deities are manufactured there, so there is no (indistinct) Money I shall bring. (indistinct) We shall bring any amount of money provided I am sure that you will make some profit. There is no scarcity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Prabhupāda, I was sick last night very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So I could not come to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last night you did not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I came to see only to have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> but I was in fever so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So capital you'll get, rest assured. Anyone will give. He will give, or I will give, the bank will give. That is (indistinct). But you must utilize it properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> You understand how to utilize?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no scarcity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Utilize means return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Return means to utilize it properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No return also gradually, not at a time. Because if you take five thousand rupees, pay at the rate of five hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is concerned, that is our home, Aligarh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Aligarh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Money is concerned, you'll get any amount. Now organize and (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Now, another thing I wanted to ask. Many devotees were asking me if we could make a Deity of Your Divine Grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not very, well... That is not immediate. We shall see later on. You can make. That we shall see later on. Not immediately. Immediately you make this arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And for design of Gaura-Nitāi and Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, we should just use the same design or we should make better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make a hand design like that and have your people make like that. Make a nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Make, yes. I mean, better design.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, make a better design. And the hand will be like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Not like this. I like this myself. It's Navadvīpa style.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Navadvīpa style.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, I like this much better. Otherwise the arms are too long and thin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way make a nice design Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. And Rādhārāṇī should be like this. This is Vṛndāvana style. Not this. This is Lakṣmī style. This. Make these arrangements. I am hopeful of this business. Very good business we'll have. I want to introduce in every family. They'll do it. If they do not worship, let them keep as dolls. That will also give them inspiration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Actually so many Indians in their house they're keeping just like dolls. They are not worshiping regularly. They're keeping on the mantlepiece or on the side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way be encouraged and in full capacity do business and get others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There was one boy who just came from Italy and he's expert in wood carving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> So we can take artists for wooden <span class="Italic">siṁhāsanas.</span> <span class="Italic">Siṁhāsanas</span> he said he can make. He even brought his tools. He has a whole box of tools he brought just for carving and he studied in the south of Spain, religious architecture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can make a small <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana</span> for the Deities, collapsible. So that if anyone wants, he can dispatch them. (end)</div>
