<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was living with servant and two sons. So I helped to start... [break] ...took from my friends, I collected some money and... So other important members said, "Why Abhaya Bābu is living separately? He should be the president of the Bombay." I never said, but they said. I was living separately. Then Prabhupāda requested, I mean to say, pleaded in my behalf so many things. He said three words, "It is better that he is living outside your company. He will do, when time will come, he'll do himself everything. You haven't got to recommend him." These very words. [break] ...Kṛṣṇa require any president or any GBC. He's giving chance to everyone, that's all. Otherwise thousands of presidents and thousands of GBC may come and go, His work will go on. Kṛṣṇa is complete Himself. He doesn't require anyone's help. That is Kṛṣṇa. [break] <span class="Italic">...sei hetu pracāra.</span> One who has got life, he can preach. One is dead, what he can do? He used to say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And I'm convinced Prabhupāda, that in this temple, right here, you can make every week at least two, three life members, and you can sell thousands of rupees worth of books. Yesterday I started one man, this boy Ikṣvāku from Germany. I said, "Just go around and greet people and show them around and sell them books." And the first few hours he sold seventy rupees worth of books. And if I have a few people who just walk around and they walk right up to the guests and say, "How do you do? My name is so and so. I come from New York. What is your name? Where do you come from?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last night all visitors came, all respectable gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Last night four people came, they were all big businessmen. One man had been working in a big business in Germany. He spoke German perfectly well. He was an Indian man. He lives in Agra. And so many people. Because Vṛndāvana is the heart of India, every Indian comes once in his lifetime to Vṛndāvana...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...if not more times. And everyone will come to our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Due to Vṛndāvana, our temple is advertised all over India. Everyone says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We haven't even got to go out. We have simply to receive people nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...from Vṛndāvana. I was residing here after retirement. That Rādhā-Dāmodara, they are being paid monthly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You got the receipt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, I don't have it personally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then who keeps it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know. I have to check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know? Who is paying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I'll check with Viśvambhara. I don't know, to be quite honest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> To be perfectly honest, I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know? How is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because I've been away so much, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Still, you should know what is this and what is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I know. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...he was going to cleanse these rooms, so whether this is going on or not, you do not know. Then who knows it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Viśvambhara would know because he took full charge in my absence for all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You want me to take care of it? Your rooms at Rādhā-Dāmodara? You want me to take care that they're cleaned and kept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was being done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I had it being done once a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So nobody knows what is being done or... [break] So one was to control horses. So he became very much anxious, "What kind of whip I shall have to keep?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> First he has to get a horse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Then, first of all, rascal, where is your horse?" (laughs) He became very much anxious, "What kind of whip?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> O.K. I'll get the horses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And anyone who can purchase a horse, he can very easily purchase any whip. Not that we shall be very much anxious for the whip first. First of all, let us have a horse. The difficulty is that no horses coming. That is the difficulty. Attract horse, and you'll find so many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> O.K. (end)</div>
