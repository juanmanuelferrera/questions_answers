<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> What about if it is too warm then? I mean why don't they...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Too warm, too cold, both are bad. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...too warm, but it is not bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) In India it is actually so. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (2):</span> ...land is getting the benefit by your lotus feet, actually pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...propaganda is going on to kill God. <span class="Italic">Pani haya svapisaca khanakila.</span>(?) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that India this year has produced a record crop of wheat, surplus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if they work, they can do that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In West Bengal they have huge quantities of rice surplus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Could that be due to our <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly. <span class="Italic">Bhavanti parjanyaḥ parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ.</span> There was big valley like this in Tokyo. We walked, and there was a creek like this. Not so dirty. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> ...high commissioners, for the passport. They're so demoniac, they're not working at all, they're.... [break] ...politics and they sit there. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is sympathetic with this movement. Everyone wants godlessness. And this movement is preaching about God, so nobody likes us. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They've poisoned the lakes so much in Canada now that they've been making an attempt to turn rivers around in northern Ontario to flush the lakes out like a toilet, so they can flush part of the water down to cities like Chicago. [break] (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To save all these botherations. You live here? How long you'll live in Canada?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Nine years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> How long will you live here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I don't know. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...the leaf movement. That movement is another watering of the leaf and branches instead of the root, to try to improve the lakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...<span class="Italic">nābhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ paramam avyayam.</span> It has been published in the paper that we consider everyone a rascal, miscreant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious. That has been published. (laughter) You have seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Which paper was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Times.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...question? Tell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The reply to..., I don't exactly know the question, the reply was that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The question was what was Prabhupāda's opinion about other gurus, like Guru Maharaj-ji and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Prabhupāda replied that "We are not interested in so-called other gurus. Simply we know this, that Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that persons who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they're either foolish, miscreants, sinful, lowest amongst mankind, or their knowledge is stolen by illusion." Unquote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> General definition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">Los Angeles Times</span> has a circulation of one and a half million daily. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...recently I said all these so-called gurus are either rascals, miscreant, lowest of the mankind, or they have no knowledge. Not directly, indirectly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How's that, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is fact. These rascals come here for women and money, that's all. They do not know what is spiritual life. If I say like that, you think it is right or wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You're right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Good idea. You didn't compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why compromise? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think the nondevotees would like to be classified in one of those four categories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are. They may not, they may like or not like, it doesn't matter, but they are. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...that even persons who come to Kṛṣṇa with material desires, although...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are pious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is it to be understood that a very simple person who has all kinds of material desires, if he approaches God...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he has approached God, therefore he's pious. Even though he has got material desires. <span class="Italic">Akāmaḥ sarva-kāmo vā mokṣa-kāma [SB </span>2.3.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> One day, he'll become devotee. Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He went to search God for some material benefit, but when he became perfect, he became pure devotee. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...are better off than the godless philosophers and <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span>? These people are better off than the mental speculator <span class="Italic">jñānīs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, oh, yes, thousand times. [break] ...gentleman has not come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yesterday? No. <span class="Italic">Bhāgya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">So 'haṁ bhāgya</span> (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> [break] ...initiated devotee, and he follows those four regulative principles and chants sixteen rounds, will he go back to Godhead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. <span class="Italic">Mām evaiśyasi asaṁśaya.</span> Kṛṣṇa says. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru mām evaiśyasi asaṁśaya [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">. Asaṁśaya,</span> without any doubt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> But by taking initiation, will that speed up the process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I inquired yesterday. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...professor who's going to see you tonight, Professor O'Connell, he wrote a book review of Dr. Judah's book about our movement. And he said it was a very sympathetic book, Dr. Judah's, he said, and a little bit too sympathetic on one point. He made his statement. He thinks that our movement, the way we deny the flesh, he said, he called, "denying the flesh," it tends to make us a little cold in our relations to each other, and people in the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement are denying the natural affection that is somehow connected with the flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we want to, what is called, reject that society. We cannot become sympathetic with everyone. That is not our policy. <span class="Italic">Asat-saṅga-tyāga vaiṣṇava ācāra.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, when He was asked what is the general behavior of a Vaiṣṇava, He said that the first thing is that you should give up bad company. So these are bad company. We cannot have any sympathy. We cannot make any compromise with everyone. That is not possible. The modern scientists, they have made quarantine? Quarantine? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Separation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> If someone has a disease, they separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Those who are infected, they should be separated. You cannot make any compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> His point was that even amongst ourselves, even amongst the devotees, he says, there is not enough expression of love, because we don't allow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, then.... Trying to be perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Flesh, skin disease.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect does not mean that they should eat meat and drink wine. That does not mean. What is his objection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I think what it comes down to is that he objects that we are against illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (laughter) That means he is accustomed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> These professors sit around, discuss topics of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, and drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And their discussion is very blasphemous. This Dr. Dimmock, he's made much investigation on the Six Gosvāmīs, and he's read all manuscripts, and he's always going to India and studying Rūpa Gosvāmī and Lord Caitanya, but everything is extremely blasphemous that he writes. So in both ways, in their habits and whatever they write. The Library Party men, they become friendly to these professors, but only to use them more or less, that they'll accept our books, despite themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that we must do. [break] ...policy is when we go to a, what is called, a bad character, we don't go to associate with him, but to give him our association. Therefore we must be strong and very pure, so that your association, they will be benefited. For the preachers, <span class="Italic">īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu,</span> the four behavior. <span class="Italic">Īśvara, tad-adhīneṣu,</span> devotees, <span class="Italic">bāliśeṣu,</span> innocent, and <span class="Italic">dviṣatsu,</span> those who are envious. So a devotee, those who are preachers, they, <span class="Italic">prema,</span> loving God, making friendship with devotee, and those who are innocent, to deliver. And those who are envious, reject. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...professor, Śrīla Prabhupāda, named Motilal, is a Bengali Vaiṣṇava. But now he drinks and eats meat. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...objection of Professor O'Connell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He said that we don't, we deny expression of love through the body. Just like the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> are not allowed, except to have children, to have sex, and <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> not at all. So by denying, these are natural ways to express love, he says, and by denying them, the people in this movement become somewhat cold and don't have the experience of love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Love? This is love or lust?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He says there's a definite connection between the flesh and love, and you can't deny it, he said. I argued with him, but that was his viewpoint, that love is expressed through the flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how he has become a doctor in Vaiṣṇava philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's a sick doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That would mean that the dog is a great lover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> there is explanation, what is the difference between lust and love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I told him if you observe the devotees, you'll see they have very affectionate loving dealings with one another, but it's not based on the flesh. We don't have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is lust. <span class="Italic">Sahajiyā.</span> Lust is going on as love. [break] ...reviewed Dr. Judah's book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. Basically, he said it was a good book and that our movement is an important movement. But he made that one objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then how does he explain how so many devotees can live together peacefully and happily if there's no reciprocation of love? Materialists can't even live together with their wife for very long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] Śrīla Prabhupāda, they're simply interested in human flesh. They're not concerned about all the animal slaughter that's going on. They don't take objection to the animal slaughter, the animal flesh. But when it comes to the human flesh, because they think they can enjoy, then they take some concern.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are taking human flesh also. Gradually they will be accustomed to take human flesh. Carnivore also. [break] ...Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">asat eka strī-saṅgī, strī-saṅgī,</span> those who are attached to woman, he's <span class="Italic">asat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] The question might arise that a <span class="Italic">jñānī</span> is someone who is aware of his spiritual nature, that he's not this body, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> Then the <span class="Italic">karmī</span> is one who is, <span class="Italic">dehātma-buddhi,</span> in the bodily concept of life, and he's desiring so many materialistic things. So how can it be that the <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> who is after some material benefit, if he approaches Kṛṣṇa, he can be better off than the <span class="Italic">jñānī</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he has approached Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even he may be in the bodily concept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That will be rectified. <span class="Italic">Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā.</span> Huh? What is that? <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">. Api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one has come to the fire, some way or other, he'll be warm, gradually. That is the.... He has come to the right path. [break] ...<span class="Italic">kāmād bhayāt, krodhāt.</span> Either.... Anyone who comes to Kṛṣṇa.... Just like <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> they were captivated. They were village girls. They did not know what is God, what is Brahman, nothing. But they were captivated: "Kṛṣṇa is very beautiful boy." That's all. Even they forgot their own husbands. [break] ...or other, we have to develop our intense love of Kṛṣṇa. Then life is perfect. [break] (in car) One who is accepting this body as self, <span class="Italic">sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are making paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From tar, you find paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> Yes. All different types of packaging have (indistinct) as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They keep salt in here for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Salt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When it snows on the highways, trucks come and they pour salt so it keeps the snow melting. More friction on the road for the tires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wine and cigarettes, just like here you can purchase by slot. What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Machine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Machine. Yes. You pay and get cigarette and tin can. There are many boxes like that on the street, public street. And they pass urine on the road. There is no restriction, standing apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like dogs and cats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every few steps, there is a shop, young girls, wine, and a man is sitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Germany is very famous for its beer festivals. Germany. It's very famous for it's beer festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beer. Yes. Sadānanda told me. He was drinking beer in barrels. (laughs) He told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They even have a mug so big that it takes one gallon of beer at a time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they drink.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. It's possible in the summer season, one of the big tourist attraction is to go to these big beer festivals. And you can go, they last about a fortnight, one week or a fortnight, and you can travel down the Rhine Valley and move every week to a new beer festival, like that, all through the summer. It's a big tourist thing. (end)</div>
