<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That knowledge is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And again... (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Modern civilization is the civilization of the <span class="Italic">indriyas.</span> We want a civilization...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, <span class="Italic">indriyas...</span> Material civilization means <span class="Italic">indriyas,</span> but it should be so organized. That is the Vedic principles, that you enjoy your <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> in a systematic way so that you may not fall again, another difficulty. That is the Vedic way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The whole background of that modern civilization is <span class="Italic">indriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñārthe karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9].</span> That civilization is <span class="Italic">yajñārthe karma.</span> You work, but for <span class="Italic">yajña.

<div class="After-Verse">They are captivated by the external energy. They think by material advancement they will make solution of all problems. That is not possible.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">He does not know that he is bound up, hands and legs, by the laws of nature, and he is trying to solve it by his own method of material civilization. That is the mistake. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are all <span class="Italic">vimūḍhas, mūḍhas, duṣkṛtina, mūḍhas.</span> (Hindi) [break] He asked me, "What is the conception of hell?" I said, "It is your London. By artificial way you have kept it as heaven. But otherwise, it is hell." So this was published.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Bombay also is hell. Bombay, nobody inhabited this island till the Britishers came, and they created this spot. The importance of Bombay backward... Otherwise so far hell is concerned they are both place. Best is Bangalore in India. Best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Doctor can manage securing medicine, distributing. That is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Devotee (5):</span> Actually, from his talk I could understand that he actually doesn't want to do much. He said he will not be able to come and examine the patients even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Devotee (5):</span> He says, "You try to find some other doctor." He told me, "You find out names and addresses of the local doctors, and we'll pick one of them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, we cannot divert our attention. It is not possible. Say, "No." You can say that "We consulted Prabhupāda. He said, 'At the present moment, unless our building is there, we cannot accept any other extra business.' " Tell him like that. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> I suggested. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For nothing. No, no, that is not possible. These are for the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> bodily concept of life. If government has got so many hospitals, what is the use of opening a teeny hospital by us? Vivekananda policy-to collect money by school and hospital. So you can tell him that "At the present moment, we are concerned about the sanction of the building and temple. So when the building is there, then we can consider, not at the present moment. We require money. We collect for this purpose. We cannot divert attention for medicine and other things."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Devotee (5):</span> Actually I could gather that he just talked because he also said that we should train up some devotees to do bandage and other things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) No, no, this is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> We do all the work, and he gets advertised as a great charitable doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> That he has opened the clinic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> We are not all these false things. Doctor Ghosh is also after <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa-sevā.</span> [break] We will collect medicine. Our... We shall pay for the expenditure. Our men will be engaged for bandaging. (laughs) Nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> And the preaching stops.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. They cannot understand what is the meaning of this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They are such dull headed men. They have no brain to understand. They are coming down again. Just like the dog's tail. Know, dog's tail. You may, however grease it... (laughs) They are hearing about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The aim is the body, the dog's tail. They are hearing daily about Kṛṣṇa na..., but they cannot understand. It is very difficult. These <span class="Italic">karmīs...</span> Now they say... Because we are reading this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> now gradually they dispersed. Gradually they dispersed. They are not interested. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="After-Verse">The <span class="Italic">go-khara</span> class. You can say plainly that "For the present, we are not interested. We have got many more important business than this hospitalization."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> [break] ...take Caraṇāravindam from the hospital. So before we left, we had <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> And immediately all the patients became happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> The whole attitude was very dull and unhappy and morose, that "Oh, we are in the hospital. My body, my body..." As soon as we had the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> they all got out of the bed and they came and stood around and they watched and some were clapping and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. Immediately life. Oh, just try to understand how much great responsibility you have got.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> They all appreciated that we made this <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even the Russians appreciated. (aside:) Don't push it in my mouth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa (?):</span> Oh, I'm sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. [break] "...bright-faced." [break] They are surprised to see the American boys. "Are you Americans?" Do they not question? Yes. Completely changed. They cannot recognize. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. (Śrīla Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> They are only used to seeing the hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> With beard and the hair, dirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> My parents telephoned last week, and at first they couldn't recognize my voice. They couldn't believe that it was me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness has changed the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your father said that "I could not..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. He said, "Are you sure it's you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Just like a lawyer. (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Mother is also very nice. Unless father and mother is nice... I told your mother also. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...she become beautiful, now there is lusty desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reading) "She frankly proposed to Kṛṣṇa, 'My dear hero, I cannot leave you...' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was a prostitute. She was a prostitute but engaged in Kaṁsa's service. In India the prostitutes are engaged as maidservants in respectable houses still. During daytime they serve in some house, and at night they become prostitute. There are many prostitutes. One prostitute, when we were boys, she was coming to serve my mother as a lady barber. There is lady barber, for serving the ladies. And at night she was standing as prostitute. [break] ...a good relation with the neighborhood. There was no enviousness. "She is doing her own business. That's all."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So then it is looked on as a necessity in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Prostitute is necessity. Otherwise these rascals, they will pollute all the woman. Therefore, for the rascals there must be some provision. Just like opening wine shop. It is not meant for everyone. But there are drunkards. Unless they get drinking, they will create some disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So just like in Dvārakā there was prostitutes, and they were all devotees of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are many devotees, prostitutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> So that was their service, not their service, but that was their work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> But, still they were devotees of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is their profession, livelihood, but they are devotees. In Calcutta, there is a big temple. It is called Kāca-Kāminī's temple. Kāca-Kāminī means she was a prostitute, but she was kept by a very big businessman who was dealing in glass, mirrors and all... So he has made a temple for her with glass and mirrors. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">kāca. Kāca</span> means glass. Kāca-Kāminī. [break] ...have a dispensary. Dr. Ojha. He thinks in this way people can be saved. That is also necessary, but not as necessary as this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Chapter Forty-two. The Killing of the Elephant Kuvala... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are speaking of Kṛṣṇa. No Indians are interested. Just see. (Hindi) Dr. Patel and his company. (Hindi) [break] Hear about the expedition to moon but not about Kṛṣṇa. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It came off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is all right.</div>
