<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Any service for me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> What you are doing there now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Um, I've just been talking with Saurabha about the Māyāpur plans to present at this conference in Vancouver, Exposition. We're making a presentation there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> So we're getting that together. Tomorrow I'm leaving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> For Vancouver?</div>

And I'm also going to Bhuvaneśvara for Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. Then I'm going to Delhi to see that American Ambassador again about putting our name on the food list, Indo-American food list, then Vṛndāvana, then Vancouver.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So (indistinct) Delhi. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> New York. Delhi to New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> I think it is direct. That I can do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1) (Indian man):</b> (Hindi with Prabhupāda) In relation with our business also, I am thinking of going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No business. (laughter) Don't go. Business is this <i class="calibre3">hari kīrtana.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> (Hindi) I just said that I had thought of that in my own different way also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> People carry on business for happiness and enough to eat and enough clothing. That, no separate endeavor is necessary. Kṛṣṇa gives it all, and more happiness. We can attest to that because we did business. All of us were businessmen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi with guest) Oh, I see that are (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No, I am not leaving. Whether Kṛṣṇa gives me fifty rupees or five million rupees, it does not make much difference, because I am in the line, because I am in the line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I may leave any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> No, no that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I may leave any time also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That is our purpose to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Unfortunately some things happened, and some court matters are going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Court matters, some, some law suits, etc. which I have filed which aggregate to the extent of about crore rupees or so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Oh, I mean I'll get that much. That could be as good amount as you (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Where? Where? Your claim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> You have to, you have to pay so much stamping fee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> No. The maximum stamp duty to be paid is fifteen thousand. Even if you've got a claim of fifteen crore, fifteen thousand is the maximum stamp duty you have to pay. You don't have to pay more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Fifteen thousand you have to pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Hindi) ...in this age, Kali<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> (Hindi) ...he owes me money and I couldn't get my money back from him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you have no money, then you cannot get justice, because he's claiming it is right claim, but if he had no fifteen thousand, then he could not claim it. Fifteen thousand is there, then (indistinct), so on , so on. So anyone who has no money, he cannot get justice in Kali-yuga. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> A lot of that fifteen thousand is exempted in some cases, but even then you have to figure out some (indistinct) and remain in the, I mean present yourself in the court in the mood to argue and talk and all that things. So naturally if you don't have even that much, you have to forego (indistinct). What you're saying is hundred percent true. Yes. It's like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> And nowadays bribe also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest:</b> Yeah. This is a must.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> Fourth-class, <i class="calibre3">śūdra</i> (indistinct), bribe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> (indistinct) one of the partners. (indistinct) another partner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (2):</b> (indistinct) The demand it as a bribe also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> (indistinct) your partner like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Because blind leaders, we have allowed bribery to come about. In the passport line you have to stand because they suspect one thief. Every man who is a gentleman also has to stand and be inspected. It's Kali-yuga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> One thing is there, when I am worried about this thing or that thing, this is the place where I get peace of mind. I forget everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> And I don't come here with any expectation, not for liberation or anyone or anything, this or that. I, what I get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> If you're getting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> I am liberated that way already. I don't care about the liberation of tomorrow. Yeah, that's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Yes, I understand. We are in the same boat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Actually you are much advanced, so it will be very difficult for you to.... I am still at the lower level and struggling against those things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Only advanced because I'm putting more time in. Otherwise, not more advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (1):</b> Yeah. Capacity has improved. Our capacity is still limited. We are still embroiled in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guru dāsa:</b> Advanced means such and such a person has spent so many times in the business house, twenty-five years, he gets a gold watch. The only reason I may be more advanced is 'cause I get peace of mind, too, so I stay longer. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (2):</b> We have got an appointment. We have got.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> ...somewhere. Saturday they close at, by 3 or 3:30 so I want to go before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So, you can go before 3:30. There is no difficulty (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> (Sanskrit) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Guest (3):</b> (Sanskrit) <i class="calibre3">bhijāyate.</i></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Prabhupāda:</b> So I have seen this instrument. Destiny is very strong. <i class="calibre3">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa jantur deha upapattaye<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 3.31.1]<i class="calibre3">.</i> Therefore <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says that you try for that thing which was not possible in many other lives. In each life everyone gets father, mother, son, and the father's duty to son, son, that is going on. When you take birth as demigod-Indra, Candra, Varuṇa-or as human being or as animal the care-taking business is there. Even the small ant during rainy season, when there is so much flood, they take the eggs on the head-you have seen the red ant?-and finding out some place. The care-taking is there. Even the birds, a sparrow. So when their, the season for laying down eggs, they bring some straws, and keep like that to make a nest for taking care of the eggs. So this taking care by the father and mother, beginning from the ant up to the Indra, Candra <i class="calibre3">devas</i>, that is there.</div>
<div class="Verse">yas tv indragopam athavendram aho sva-karma-<br class="calibre2"/>bandhānurūpa-phala-bhājanam ātanoti <br class="calibre2"/>karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bs. </span>5.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Indra,</i> there is <i class="calibre3">indragopam,</i> one very small insect. It is also called <i class="calibre3">indra, indragopam,</i> insect. And another Indra is the King of heaven. So <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says from this Indra to that <i class="calibre3">indra,</i> everyone is bound up by his <i class="calibre3">karma</i>. It includes all others, from this <i class="calibre3">indra</i> to that Indra. <i class="calibre3">Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bs. 5.54]. Everyone is bound up by the resultant action of his <i class="calibre3">karma.</i> It cannot be changed. So <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i> says don't try to change your <i class="calibre3">karma-phala.</i> Better utilize that energy for becoming advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Because you cannot change the destiny. That is not possible. Then shall I not endeavor for improvement of my economic, economic position? No. Why? I am, because destiny, whatever you have got your destiny, you'll get it. How shall I get it? Now suppose if you are put into some unwanted circumstances. You do not want it. You are forced to accept it. So similarly, as distressed condition comes upon you without your wanting, similarly, the position of happiness also will come to you, even you don't have to try for it. <i class="calibre3">Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham</i>. Just like distressed condition, unhappiness, nobody wants, but it comes, by force. Similarly, the conditional happiness of life. Because everyone's life is mixed up with some distress or happiness. Nobody can say, "I am simply happy.'' That is not possible. Distress is there, but nobody wants distress. But it comes. So why happiness will not come? So don't waste your time in this way, because you cannot change this. This will come, automatically. You try for Kṛṣṇa consciousness, which you never tried. That is recommended. And there is a Bengali verse, <i class="calibre3">janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya:</i> to take care of oneself by the fathers, that is available in every life. Because the ant is also taking care. That is not human society, but he's still taking care. The tiger also taking care. The small cubs, they're loitering on the, on the body of the lion, and he is feeling very nice. Even monkeys, I have seen. One monkey came in window, and she had one small child, and somehow or other the child came inside my room. She, that outside monkey, became mad after it. So I had to take... (laughs) The affection is there. The ant, they're affectionate, the snake affectionate, tiger affectionate, man is affectionate. That is given; otherwise who will take care? So therefore the Vaiṣṇava<i class="calibre3"> kavi</i> says, <i class="calibre3">janame janame sabe pitā mātā pāya:</i> in every life you'll get father and mother and their protection, <i class="calibre3">kṛṣṇe guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei,</i> but in every life you cannot get Kṛṣṇa and <i class="calibre3">guru</i> take care of. Because unless you get Kṛṣṇa and <i class="calibre3">guru,</i> then you are within the cycle of birth and death. And you get father and mother and their care, that is all right, but <i class="calibre3">kṛṣṇa-guru</i> does not come in that way. That you have to search out. <i class="calibre3">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa brahmite kona bhāgyavān jīva guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti...</i> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151].<i class="calibre3"> </i>Because Kṛṣṇa,<i class="calibre3"> guru</i> will give you the nucleus of devotional life. <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa guru nahi mile bhaja hari ei.</i></div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So actually, that is the fact, and I was going to tell about Śrīdhara Swami. Śrīdhara Swami was a great devotee, so he was thinking of taking <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa.</i> So he was contemplating that "I shall now leave my home and take <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>.'' So in the meantime, his wife became pregnant. Then he thought that "I was thinking like that. Anyway, this has happened, and if I take <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i> now, what people will say, that 'His wife is pregnant and he has taken <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa,</i> he has gone out of home.' " So he waited, the child was born, and the mother died. (laughing) Then he thought, "I do not know what Kṛṣṇa desires. Who will take care of this child, motherless child?'' So that he was thinking very deeply. One lizard dropped before him, one small child lizard. Mother gave birth to a child this morning, and the small lizard was staying, and immediately small ant came before the mouth of that small lizard, and he ate. Then Śrīdhara Swami thought, "The every arrangement is there. Why I am thinking of this or that?'' Immediately went away. Actually, that is the position. The actual care is taken by Kṛṣṇa, <i class="calibre3">eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān, nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām</i> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13). He is taking care of everyone.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So destiny is that we should devote our life for awakening Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This human life is meant for that purpose. By nature's way, <i class="calibre3">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 3.27]<i class="calibre3">,</i> nature is bringing us. As soon as we become sinful, we are dropped down to suffer the sequence of sinful life in different varieties. Again, just like a man, criminal, is put into the jail, but when his time is finished, again he is made free. Similarly, the cycle of birth and death, <i class="calibre3">dehāntara-prāptiḥ, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 2.13<span class="Italic">]</span><i class="calibre3">,</i> one after another, is going on. So the animal life means reaction of sinful life, and upper class of life, demigods, means result of pious life. Two kinds of things are there, sinful and pious, through the cycle of birth is going on. But this human form of life or above human form of life, it is a chance for understanding the real value of life, and therefore for human beings there are guidances, these <i class="calibre3">Vedas, Purāṇas, Vedānta-sūtra.</i> It is meant for the human beings, not for the cats and dogs. <i class="calibre3">Anādi-bahirmukha jīva kṛṣṇa bhuli gela ataeva kṛṣṇa veda-purāṇa kaila</i> [<span class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</span> 20.117]. So it is recommended in the human form of life, first of all training as a <i class="calibre3">brahmacārī,</i> then he may remain as <i class="calibre3">gṛhastha</i> for sometime. The life is divided into four parts, twenty-five years. Suppose I live a hundred years: twenty-five years to become <i class="calibre3">brahmacārī</i>, remain as <i class="calibre3">brahmacārī</i>, and twenty-five years to remain as <i class="calibre3">gṛhastha</i>, family man, and twenty-five years as <i class="calibre3">vānaprastha</i> and twenty-five years as <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>. This is system, Vedic system. <i class="calibre3">Sannyāsa</i> means <i class="calibre3">vānaprastha</i> is the prepāration for <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa,</i> and <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i> means completely dedicated to the service of Kṛṣṇa. This is our system. Just like you are spirit soul. Our business is not here. Our business in the spiritual world. Here, by circumstances you have fallen into the material condition, but if you take "This is all-in-all our duty,'' that is not advised in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra.</i> It is circumstances. We have fallen into, under certain circumstances, so we have to take care of. The real duty is to how to save myself from this material entanglement.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">So our, this institution, that is our ambition, that we are giving, trying to give facilities, at least to some intending person, especially retired person, to take advantage of this institution. As far as possible live, for we have got rooms like that. Live there and take little <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i> and fully devote time how to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is success of life. So it is authorized by the <i class="calibre3">śāstras, pañcāś ordhvaṁ vanaṁ vrajet.</i> Therefore you'll find still. But now the things have changed that every holy places there are so many men retired. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b> (chanting Sanskrit to <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> 1.28) [break]</div>
