<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, whenever there is scarcity of supply or scarcity of food, it is not due to overpopulation. It is due to overcriminality or over-sinful activities, due to over-sinful activities, not overpopulation. It is a bogus theory. That is stated, <span class="Italic">tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are devils, who are demons...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> What was that verse, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tān aham.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Tān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the demons. Demons and godless people must be (indistinct), you cannot make a solution. You cannot surpass the law of nature. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is enough water in the ocean, but still you are suffering for scarcity of water. Why? What is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They are answering rains. (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What their answer, these rascals? Just like in Europe there is scarcity of water, they proposed to import, rascal. But there are so many oceans. So where is the scarcity of water? But why you cannot use it? Unless there is intervention by the nature's law you cannot do it. Therefore you are completely under the laws of nature. Nature will punish you, nature will reward you, according to your acts. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">, ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> You are falsely thinking that you are independent. A slight deviation from the laws of nature will put you into difficulty. Immediately there are... You can close this door. [break] ...population. In any case, one can be punished when the nature's supply is restricted. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Third Chapter.</div>
<div class="Verse">yajña-śiṣṭāśinaḥ santo<br class="calibre2"/>mucyante sarva-kilbiṣaiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhuñjate te tv aghaṁ pāpā<br class="calibre2"/>ye pacanty ātma-kāraṇāt<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 3.13]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in order to release ourself from the sinful reaction of sinful activity, we must perform <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> And in this age the easiest process of <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span> (long pause) So what are the problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Under "problems" are... There are some general problems such as taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Taxes. Taxation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, taxation. So that is... You have created problem. When you transgress the laws of nature, this, there is shortage of supply. And the government, on this plea they will tax to mitigate your miseries. Actually they will not be able to mitigate your miseries, but on the plea of your miseries they will levy taxes and divide amongst themselves. So this is another way of punishment because the government is your government. Because you are rascal, so you elect some, another rascal. And they invent ways of rascaldom to mitigate your miseries. To avoid taxation means you become good man and you select your ruler, good men. Then there will be no taxation. (long pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Other problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Other problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Race relations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Race relations? That is also ignorance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Kṛṣṇa is original father. Where is the question of race? You are all brothers. (long pause) So all problems solved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> As far as I'm concerned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I can't think of any more major problems. I remember...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Problem... As long as you have got this material body you'll have problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One after another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the best solution is to go back home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We have to convince them that they have problems because they think that they're enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. Therefore they require education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They don't know the real standard of enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they can know? There is no understanding. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> (pause) To solve all these problems, therefore, there must be a class of men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Not a class, a section of people must become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> And all other sections should consult them and live as <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas, vaiśyas, śūdras.</span> Then? It is finished now? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well, we've solved all the problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We've solved all the problems. Now we want to convince this Vinoda Bhave to support us?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So can you see what is the position, my quarters?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, Mūrti said your side is fit for moving into. But if they have... See, Bhogilal Patel is not here yet, so I thought if we wait at least till tomorrow, if you want, then that will give them the chance to get a few more doors on, and then, if Bhogilal comes tomorrow, then we can move in the morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> See, they have all the wood now for the doors, and they need one more day and then all the doors will be fitted in the whole house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do that tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And that will be a lot safer too. Security reasons, it will be a lot better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tomorrow morning we can go. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">śuddhyed sattva,</span> purify your existence. (end)</div>
