<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> There are three or four men coming at ten o'clock. One Mr. Nera(?) from the... They're all from one place where they deal with alcoholics and drug addicts. And they work for the government. And Mr. Nera(?) is a social worker, and for fifteen years he's worked in mental hospitals also. And there's a psychologist from Burma, and a psychiatric nurse and maybe one other, at ten o'clock. And I talked to some people who do radio conversations yesterday. And they want me to check back today. But they may come tonight or possibly tomorrow morning. Is it all right for tomorrow morning also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When we are starting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> We are starting not... The plane flies at two o'clock. So in the morning there would be time, I think. But if they come they will broadcast it on radio, the conversation. And perhaps that man, the geographer, will come again. He told me to check back today because he has to see if he can make it in the schedule.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when he will be given time, five?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well, I can give him time tonight if he can come. Otherwise I can tell the radio people to come tonight. I have to telephone them and arrange it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...if people do not like, that is another thing. What is the wrong if I say, "Please chant Hare Kṛṣṇa."? If you don't chant, that is your choice. There is no difficulty. If you agree that "Swamiji asking me. We'll chant," you can chant. But if you don't do it, that is your business. The task it not difficult. Task is very easy. Even a child can do it. But if you are stubborn, "No, no, I will not do it," then what can be done? (?) <span class="Italic">Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro...</span> You know this song, huh? Caitanya Mahāprabhu says... You have got this cassette? <span class="Italic">Jīv jāgo, jīv jāgo, gauracānda bole.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I may have it in my briefcase. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He is canvassing, "Now get up. How you are remaining in ignorance still? You have got this human form of body; still, you remain as cats and dogs. Why is that? This is spell of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> You get up." "No, I am very much... I cannot break out of this. Too much I am afflicted." Then he says, "I have got medicine." <span class="Italic">Enechi auṣadhi.</span> "I have got the medicine. You take it." <span class="Italic">Enechi auṣadhi māyā nāśibāro lāgi', hari-nāma mahā-mantra lao tumi māgi'.</span> "You take it from Me, <span class="Italic">hari-nāma mahā-mantra.</span>" So this is our mission. We have got the medicine to awake the people from this ignorance. He doesn't know anything. He is busy only with his fifty years. Nowadays less still, we live, such rascaldom we are. "We have got the medicine. Now you take it." This is our canvassing, Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> If you don't agree, that is your business. That is your misfortune. The disease is there, and the remedy is also there. So we offer you the remedy free of charges, and if you don't take it, then it should be understood that you are so misfortunate, unfortunate.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">What is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He is thinking of the <span class="Italic">vox populi,</span> but he forgets about himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> He is saying "I don't know if it's practical because they won't take," but he doesn't realize that he should take even if they don't take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> I must go and make the flower garlands. (end)</div>
