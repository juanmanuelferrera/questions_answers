<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...made of grass?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They make plastic grass.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They make it out of plastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even plastic, they can cover big land like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Almost this big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They cover football fields. They can cover big areas, but it's artificial. [break] ...flowers also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You take. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> ...shopping centers, they also make plastic trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> In the big shopping centers they have plastic trees growing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They don't need any water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't grow. [break] ...say, though, that "We don't want to enter into a religious, philosophical discussion. Simply we are trying to improve the standard of life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What improvement you have done? What improvement you have done? I do not wish to die. Can you help me? Then what improvement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What improvement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we can make it more comfortable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My father died, his father died, his father died, so I'll die, my son will die. What improvement you have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can make it more comfortable to die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Peaceful death. This will be accepted by rascals. That's all. If I am going to die, where is comfort? Death is comfortable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> My mother is a nurse, and she told me that she's seen many people die, and she said, "It is very nice. It is very peaceful..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your mother is also peaceful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> She's dead. (laughter) I went to see her when she was dying, and I told her that "Now you should chant Hare Kṛṣṇa because you're going to die." She said, "No, I am not ready. I'm going to fight it." But she lost the fight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (to passerby) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Another girl went to see her mother when her mother was dying, and she told her mother, "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa," and her mother said, "Shut up," and then died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] Because we don't accept their scientific achievements as being worthy, for example, in medicine, and things like this, they will say that our argument is one-sided. Just like that Dr. Wolfe. He was thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is one-sided?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we simply say that the scientists have done nothing good to further human cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we don't say that. We say that you take credit as far as you have been successful. Why do you say there is no God? We protest against that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...there's a God, then they won't be making so many materialistic arrangements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't require it. [break] ...so many materialistic improvements, we require open field like this. We require trees. That is nature's gift. Although we have got this car, we come here to take advantage of nature's gift. Why you have come here? The city was there. I don't like. So actually you enjoy nature's gift. Important persons, they work whole week in the city, and as soon as there is weekend they go to the village. Why? The enjoyment is in the village. They do not like to stay in the factory. It is disgusting. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just like sleep. And just like when we're sleeping it's very comfortable, then why should we be afraid of dying? It's very comfortable. Death is just like sleep. When we're sleeping we feel.... So why, then, we should be afraid of death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are actually afraid. Why? You say.... You are a great philosopher: "Why should we be afraid?" But if I kill you, immediately you cry. Why? Don't cry. Let peacefully die. I kill you? Why do you protest, "This man is killing me, killing me! Save me! Save me! Save me! Police! Police! Police!" Why? Die peacefully. I am helping you to die peaceful. Why you make me criminal? [break] ...says, "Thou shall not kill." If killing is peaceful, dying is peaceful, why He has prohibited?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Even though you may kill me, we still don't mind that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am not so fool I am going to kill you. That is an..., the business. But you die peacefully. Let him throw in the sea. Die peacefully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, they are theorizing that "Death is a very peaceful state of sleeping. Why are we protesting so much"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not sleeping. After sleeping you have to awake, and you have to bark like dog, "Give me food. <span class="Italic">Gow! Gow! Gow!</span>" You are not going to sleep after death. You are awakening like a dog, and bark and disturb others. That is your mistake, that you are sleeping forever. No sleeping. You have to wake up again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...told me that he was.... He said that spirit and matter are the same. So I grabbed him and threatened to punch him in the nose. He said, "No, no, that is different."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] So if we have to wake again, then there's no really.... Why should we have to stop birth and death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have no experience? Do you sleep perpetually, whole day and night? Why do you wake up? Is it not your experience that you sleep at night and wake up at daytime?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. But if I'm going to wake again, then why should I want to stop it? I go to sleep; I wake up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but your waking.... You are going to wake up like a dog. That is the privilege. You sleep perpetually..., not perpetually, for seven months, and then you wake up as a dog. The body is changed. And go on barking. That you do not know. That is ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's amazing. You go to sleep in a human body, and you wake up in a dog body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that's it. What is this conglomeration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> [break] ...wakes up the next morning. I am not afraid to go to sleep because I know that I will wake up. So if I'm going to die and I know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Die means you sleep as a man and wake up as a dog. That is dying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But it is okay to be a dog. It is okay to be a dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But if you are so foolish that it is okay to be dog, then it is very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if we live forever, then where's the harm in changing bodies a few times? We can enjoy in all different kinds of bodies and have a good time whilst we're here. And if we're eternal, then what is the big rush to get out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on. For the foolish person, it is going on. [break] ...land there is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...farms all over the world, even in India, they have to irrigate the land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have to irrigate the land artificially like this. Either they dig a ditch and they pour water into the ditch by some method, or sprinkling like this. So in a society where everyone is God conscious, Kṛṣṇa says how He supplies the rain. Was there any need even for such irrigation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Irrigation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Irrigation means digging a hole beside where the vegetables or grains are growing. Or will the rain just fall from the sky naturally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to work. Otherwise.... This is material world. Without working, you cannot get anything. [break] ...between material world and spiritual world. In the material world you have to work to get your necessities. In the spiritual world there is no need of working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...talking about the spiritual world is pie in the sky. They say that we should just talk about how to take care of things here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot take care. There are so many problems. You cannot take. You are simply crying, "The problems are there. Problems are there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Then they will say, "Well, how will talking about the spiritual world help solve the problems here in the material world?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...concerned with the material world, you remain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...put out by the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> and it is a book on how to become peaceful and happy, and it shows pictures of dogs and cats sleeping, and it says, "This is how you do it. You should lie down like this and everything will be all right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The dog is lying peacefully because he has got sense that "I have got a good master." Therefore he is sleeping. They do not sleep peacefully without master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, is that the scientists have been proven guilty. Now we have to decide what their punishment should be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature will punish them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...kind of programs should we develop to defeat the scientists? Just like we distribute books in the street. A lot of times the scientists may not get some of these books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Defeat is that "You are scientist. I don't want death. Please stop it." Ask him. "I don't want disease. Please stop it. Then you are scientist. Otherwise I kick on your face."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Should we go to the colleges and universities and make program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...these rascals are being controlled at every step; still, they are thinking independent. That is the difficulty. They are being kicked in every moment, and still they are thinking, "I am free."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone is following the scientists, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everyone is following the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not everyone. We don't follow. You may follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> One professor was telling me that he didn't think you should write about all these things about the universe in your books, because none of the scientists will believe it. So I told him that all the scientists were hogs, dogs, camels and asses, and he became enraged, and he left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But it's not so unbelievable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is, the scientists will not believe? We say, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ: [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> "As the child is becoming boy, boy is becoming, similarly you have to change body." What scientist has to challenge this? But they are obstinate dog. <span class="Italic">Dehāntara-prāptiḥ</span> you have to accept. Can the scientist say, "No, no, no, the child is not going to be a young man or boy"? Can he say like that? Then why they challenge unnecessarily? They are changing the body. Can the scientists stop it? But if they are unreasonable dogs, then what can be done? What argument will reach them? A dog cannot understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Just stick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, they will not understand even with stick. You see? They are less than dog. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> days, <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">],</span> very simple argument, that "As the child is becoming boy, boy is becoming young man, young man is becoming middle-aged man, and middle-aged is becoming old man, similarly, you are changing body." So where is the difficulty to understand? But they are so obstinate rascal, they will not believe. As soon as the child is dead, does he become boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? What is the scientists' reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say he's dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They say the brain and the heart stopped working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you replace it, rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> We're working on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are such.... Obstinate dogs. [break]...difficulty. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> They are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> and they will continue to remain <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Then how you can make him enlightened? They cannot answer properly. Why a dead child born does not grow, does not change body? The body is a lump of matter. Analyze the body. Where is life? These are all very reasonable. But they will not. Dog's obstinacy. How you can convince them? Simply waste of time, talk with them. Therefore they should be neglected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They did one experiment where they took a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They did an experiment where they took an embryo of a child, and they put it in a test tube, large bottle, and they were growing it by feeding it, and it just turned into a shapeless blob.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why did you take embryo from the child? You make embryo. You cannot make even an egg which can be..., give a chicken. So to waste time with these rascals is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Such programs are minimized in the temple. Should there be a college program in each temple? Or should everyone just work along with the BBT Library Party? Should there be a college program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is useless to talk with them. If you can peacefully sell some books, that's all. Don't enter into very long arguments, because they are all rascals. They cannot understand. Better peacefully, as far as possible, sell some books. <span class="Italic">Dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya kāku-śataṁ kṛtvā ca...</span> This is the process. They cannot understand that because there is soul within the child, therefore child is becoming boy. As soon as there is no soul, the child does not become a boy. This simple philosophy they cannot understand, so what is their position? Now, this car is standing because there is no driver. Anyone can understand. Stand still. It will remain there for thousands of years unless a driver comes. Simple reason. But they are so rascal, they will not understand. So what is the use of talking with them? Simply waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> These people cannot be converted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. The dog cannot be converted. But we have to do it with stick. [break] ...that a dead child can be brought scientifically into life and he will grow, and still, they'll argue. So what is the use of argument with these rascals? When they are caught up, that "Do this," "Yes, we shall do in the future," and "What about the present?" there is no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everywhere we see millions and millions of different types of bodies are all growing, there's living force there, but still, they haven't been able to find it, and it's there all the..., everywhere, surrounding them, so what kind of scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...provement. Have you improved this, that a dead body can be brought into life by scientific arrangement? And still, they'll say "improvement." What improvement? Simply dry talks, that is science? [break] First subject matter for scientific advancement, that there is soul within the body. On account of the presence of the soul, the body is changing. So the soul is different from the body. So this is the first education of scientist. And they have avoided this major.... They simply bluffing people, "We have discovered this..." What you have discovered? Discover this: What is the principle within the body? Real discovery, they are not interested. They are bluffing. They are fools, making others fools and going on as scientific advancement. First of all answer this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rādhāvallabha Prabhu<span class="Italic">...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Can you challenge? "Do this first. What is your science? This is rascal science. You give up the major problem; you are making research how many atoms are working. What you will do by understanding atoms are going?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it's very difficult to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Difficult? Then you are not scientist. You cannot touch the difficult problem. Childish thing, you are bluffing children, that's all. You have no power to tackle the difficulties. You cannot give life to the dead body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] But if we don't make the research, then how will we ever solve these problems?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are.... As soon as you say "making research," then you are not perfect. Don't say that you are scientist. You are student. Don't say that you are scientist. And you are declaring, "There is no authority, nothing." Why do you speak all this nonsense? Because you are not scientist. You are making research. That's all right. When you complete your research-you come to the conclusion-then call yourself as scientist. Why, as a student, neophyte, you are claiming as "scientist"? Why misleading people? You do not know anything, how things are going on, and you are claiming you are scientist. Our point is, "Don't do this, misleading propaganda. You are not scientist. We protest against this false propaganda. Why you are making.... You do not know anything. You cannot solve any problem, major problem, so why you are claiming scientist? Stop this as a gentleman." [break] And there is the soul within the body, and when the soul is gone, transferred to another body, it is dead. <span class="Italic">Dhīras tatra na muhyati</span> [Bg. 2.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is actually scientist, he is not surprised. He knows the soul has transferred to another body. That's all. That is scientist. [break] ...real scientist, not a rascal like you. We don't give.... [break] You cannot act. We accept Kṛṣṇa as scientist because He explains. You cannot explain. How we can accept you as scientist? You are rascal. Up till now, nobody was able to explain-simply vague. How we can accept these vague explanation as scientist? And daily changing, every year new theories. And I have to accept you scientist? Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span> five thousand years ago. It was known very well, and it is going on. That is science. You cannot give any solution, you are changing your ideas and theories every year, and we have to accept you as scientist? [break] ...speaking something, and I have to accept him as scientist? Madman, crazy fellow, saying something today, saying something other next day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In Māyāpura you gave that Bengali proverb, "A madman, what he cannot say? A goat, what he cannot eat?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (chuckles) [break] They are afraid. Stop disease, stop old age, stop birth, stop death. [break] ...the major problems, and you call yourself.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...the most important thing. Why should we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. That proves that you are a rascal number one. These are not important things. Why do you keep memory of so many dead men in statues? It is not important thing. He has died, died. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say that being able to work on all of our practical problems in the material world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this is practical. You make something that nobody will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But a lot of them already admit that there's nothing we can do about death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't call yourself scientist. The problems are there. You cannot solve them. [break] ...intelligent way of defeating so-called scientists. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You are asking us to make solution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my problem. If anyone can solve this problem, I will call him scientist. That is everyone's problem. The artists, they are trying to remain young, especially the ladies. And still, the scientist cannot stop this, that "No more becoming old, old." Then where is your improvement? You have invented some cosmetic. You apply it, and your, what is called, hollow cheek will be swollen up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, in London recently, just like they have plastic grass, they have plastic trees, they have a plastic woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is all right, but the plastic woman will not satisfy me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They have operations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply rascals, that's all. Better not to talk with, that "You are rascal number one. I don't want to waste my time. When you make solution of these problems, then we shall talk. Now go on researching and befool your followers that in future you'll get." That's all.</div>
