<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> ...cannot accept anything artificial but Mr. Vijaya cannot keep up to that standard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vinoba Bhave is also not cent percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, I know. But by chance, on this particular point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written books, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā Pravacana.</span> In his <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> there is no <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti.</span> So what is this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā Pravacana.</span> Why he has avoided <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti?</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gandhi has... He's envious. The same thing. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he is writing essays on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> but the main principle of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">, mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām evaiṣyasi satyaṁ te pratijāne priyo 'si me.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They don't follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their defect. Therefore they are failures. Must be failure. They do not take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. They mix with their false ideas. And therefore spoil, adulterate. And <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti</span> is without adulteration. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Pure. No adulteration. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. Sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ tat-paratvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is not <span class="Italic">nirmalam. Sa mala</span> it is. With <span class="Italic">mala.</span> With <span class="Italic">mala. Mala.</span> It cannot be. Proportionately. So where she has sent this article?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> In some of the newspapers in Vaidore, maybe Nagpur. He's writing for about three or five copies of those original clippings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has written very nicely. Good writer. Picked up the essence of the movement. That was published. (Hindi) So distribute them. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Darśana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next issue. This issue is all finished. Next one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just stop this light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Then it won't be for Kumbhamela<span class="Italic">.</span> Prabhupāda wanted it for Kumbhamela<span class="Italic">.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Well, I don't know. It will be a big program there from part of (indistinct) mission. They've spent four <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They never... I never thought they had so much money even for their own projects.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian men:</span> They collect from the big Sikhs. (indistinct) He is very influenced. For Kumbhamela, all the Marwari want to wash off all the sins they did. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So explain with that purpose. At least, they are sensible. [break] You cannot give up these four things: <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> <span class="Italic">dāna, tapasya.</span> So <span class="Italic">yajña</span> for the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> begin <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> And <span class="Italic">dāna</span> for the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> and <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> for the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs. Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyam,</span> Kṛṣṇa says. Do not give up this. "I have become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> therefore I'll give up my <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> also." <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> means the life of <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> If you give up <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> also then what remains? How you become a <span class="Italic">sannyāsa? Yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat. </span>It must be continued. And again He stresses <span class="Italic">yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām.</span> Even if you think that you have become very great, "Now I'm very exalted personality. I don't require. I have become <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa,</span>" No, no, no, no. This <span class="Italic">yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma,</span> even if you are very exalted, still, it will purify you more, these things. <span class="Italic">Yajño dānaṁ tapaś caiva pāvanāni manīṣiṇām.</span> In any condition of life these things cannot be given up. So those who are in sense, <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> they must give in charity, at least fifty percent of their income. That was shown by Rūpa Gosvāmī. He, fifty percent. <span class="Italic">Dānam</span> means not to the <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa. Dānam</span> means to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, </span>Vaiṣṇava. In our <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> charity is recommended to be given to the high-class men, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and Vaiṣṇavas. They know how to spend money. Therefore <span class="Italic">dātavyam iti yad dānaṁ tad dānaṁ sāttvikam ucyate.</span> Just like this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they are appreciating. So all the charity should come here. Then it is properly utilized. Because we do not use a single paisa for anything of sense gratification. We do not even smoke, we do not take tea, we lie down on the floor. Not a single paisa is spent for our sense gratification. Everything is utilized for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore all charity should come here. Properly spent. But if we misspend, that is our fault. Single paisa we spend for our sense gratification, that is fault of us. And people should give at least fifty percent of their income to this movement. Twenty-five percent to the family and twenty-five percent let him keep for himself in case of emergency. This is the example shown by Rūpa Gosvāmī. So there was emergency. Everything they showed practically. Sanātana Gosvāmī was arrested. Whatever money they kept for themselves, was given as bribe to the jail superintendent and got out of jail. This is example given by Gosvāmī, that fifty percent was given to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and Vaiṣṇavas, fifty percent they deposited with the local... Formerly the <span class="Italic">bāniyās</span> were bankers, village bankers. Whatever one has got, extra money, they should deposit, and the <span class="Italic">bāniyās</span> will give him some interest and utilize the money. He will not usurp the money. People believe, just like bank, everywhere, crores of rupees they are collecting daily because people know, "As soon as I shall want the money, it will be paid." So <span class="Italic">bāniyās</span> were very honest. By others money, they would prosper, and the money is ready. Because they were doing with commodities, even he has no cash money he can immediately sell something and pay. That was the credit. That was the credit. Then people believed them. The village bankers were these grocers, especially the gold merchants. Therefore the gold merchants were bankers and dealers in gold. <span class="Italic">Suvarṇa-vaṇik.</span> They had position. They have got stock of ornaments, gold ornaments, silver utensils. So you can believe in him, that by putting in his custody one hundred, one thousand rupees he can deliver. At any moment. The bankers. And Rūpa Gosvāmī did it practically. Some money for emergency, some money... Relatives they also expect. That is allowed. So they should be given something. Not that cent percent. At least 25% to the relatives and 25% for personal. And 50% for Kṛṣṇa. This is the system. So this is called <span class="Italic">dānam.</span> Kṛṣṇa also says <span class="Italic">kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam.</span> "If you want to give in charity, give it to Me." <span class="Italic">Kuruṣva tad mad-arpaṇam. Dadāsi yat.</span> "If you have got some capacity to give something, give it to Me." He never said to <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> I do not know how they manufactured these things. Kṛṣṇa says, "Give it to Me." He's not <span class="Italic">daridra.</span> He's Nārāyaṇa, but He's not <span class="Italic">daridra.</span> The principle is to give to the richest Nārāyaṇa, not <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span> But these rascals misinterpret that <span class="Italic">daridra</span> has become Nārāyaṇa. How <span class="Italic">daridra</span> can become Nārāyaṇa? This is going on. And therefore there is no effect. There is no effect. See from practical what Vivekananda has done? But they have made propaganda, false propaganda, they have got roads. In a city like Bombay, big road, Vivekananda. But they do not care what Vivekananda has done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Even they got road, in the road so many nonsense going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That every road is there. We have no such thing. (Hindi) But he's not recognized in... Wherefrom he has got the advertisement that in America he has done tremendous work. What they have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> The government may like to popularize him because he preached the cult of "work hard."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What "work hard" he has... (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Other day one man was telling me they bought two of your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams,</span> Ramakrishna Mission. He said that one Ranganath Swami from South India, from Hyderabad was lecturing there but he was... When he was lecturing he had your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> First Canto, Part One in his hand and he was speaking from there. (laughter) I said it is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Give him <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Many <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they imitate you. They read your books and take some of this part and what is useful for them they use on their lecture. How we should stop them? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> At least part of the lecture's going to be all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot utilize my writing in their favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, some of the thing they take for their favor. They glory their own. They read your books and they glorify their own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we should stop them like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Don't stop. They cannot do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It means that Prabhupāda has influenced them to say what Prabhupāda has written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ranganath was speaking from my book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, he was quoting that <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> I remember from First Canto, Part One. That one our life members... They were all the... All the big people, they goes there. So he told me when he came, he took a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> He said that today Ranganath had your book. I said that they had bought two books from me. He opened that like this. Then he saw the cover of our book so he was quoting <span class="Italic">śloka</span> from that and he was reading the purport and giving speech on that, because there is no such edition in English on <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> except yours. So that I was very much pleased actually when I heard that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the beginning also they purchased. When I published three copies in Delhi they purchased because such translation is not there. So, that is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
