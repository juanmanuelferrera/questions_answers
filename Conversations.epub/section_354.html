<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...morning," what is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Well, it's just actually become an expression of greeting. Literally, of course, it means that "I am pleased to see you, happy to meet you. Good morning."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In English when we say, "Goodbye," that means "God be with you." Some God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They say, "Good morning. Good morning to you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Like one pig grunting at another pig.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Good morning" means... Because it is English word... In England every morning is bad morning, because it is cloud. When they see one day that cloud is clear, they say, "Good morning." (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...similarly, a good soul means when there is no <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> then he's good soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Or cloud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Cloud. <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is cloud. So what is that cloud?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Forgetfulness of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cloud is when a soul desires to become the master. That is cloud. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Verse">kṛṣṇa bhūlīya jīva bhoga-vañchā kare<br class="calibre2"/>pasate māyā tare japaṭiya dhare</div>
<div class="After-Verse">As soon as a soul desires to be enjoyer, then he is immediately captured by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...see the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> You can go. I saw it yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> I think it is in the opposite direction of the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...formation of water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Do you know? A scientific explanation of water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> H-2-O. Hydrogen, two molecules of hydrogen, one molecule of oxygen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in anywhere there is water, that formula is applicable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, within the dob there is water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who supplied the chemicals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Within the dob?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The chemist. The supreme chemist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is our theologist's... What is their explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say the water is from the ground. By the roots, it is drawn up to the dob.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I understand that. But the chemical is being supplied from the root?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes. Just like when there is no water they say the tree will die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> When there is no rain, the plant life cannot live. So they say that the water is drawn from the root to nourish the plant. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...water is drawn, then the question will be how the water is drawn?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Well, each tree has a system of, er, system of like tubes through which the water is drawn up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then as soon as there is system, system is done by somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Nature, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Nature, mother nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then mother nature why does not allow you to draw water from the ground? Then mother nature has got sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Why mother nature doesn't let us draw water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we cannot draw water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> But from the well we can draw water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> We can find water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In the mouth we have to drink it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not like the tree. Trees are called <span class="Italic">padapa. Padapa</span> means it draws water from the leg. But why you cannot draw water from the leg, by the leg? Why you draw water by the hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Because it's nature's arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means nature has got sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say that nature has simply the desire to see that the species is propagated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, when you see nature has arranged like that, just try to understand that the tree is made to draw water from the legs, but you cannot do. You have to draw water from the hand. Why different? As there is discrimination, there is sense. You should... It is nature's, I mean to say, order that, or arrangement that "You shall draw water from the hand, and the tree shall draw from the leg." So as there is different arrangement, there is discretion, why I am allowed to draw water by the hand and the tree is allowed to draw water from the leg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> They say that evolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, there is discretion. As soon as you say evolution, then evolution means there is also some arrangement that "You shall act like this, and he shall act like this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> Some people already believe, "Well, we already have so much water." Just like when we sweat, there is already water there. There's no question of drawing it from the... like the trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you draw water? Why you draw water from other source? If you have got water? If you haven't got water, that's all right. Is that sufficient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Their idea of the arrangement is that everything is meant for man, for his exploitation and enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Everything is meant for man's, he's the chief living entity. That's their understanding of the arrangement. The tree may have to do this, but we can drink it another way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Man uses his intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there is some superior supervision that "You must do like that. He must do like that." You call it nature. We accept that. We also say... Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ: [Bg. </span>3.27] "Everything is being done by the direction of <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> nature." So nature is superior than you. You have to accept. Because you are being directed by nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Their hope is that they can become superior to nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. That is rascaldom. There is the foolishness.</div>
<div class="Verse">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br class="calibre2"/>guṇaiḥ sarvaśaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br class="calibre2"/>kartāham iti manyate<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.27]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This rascal, is being dictated by nature, but he's thinking that "I am the Lord."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He wants to be the best.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā. Vimūḍha,</span> rascaldom, <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> by self-conceit. Falsely he's thinking that "I am doing it." Or "I shall be able to do it, without." This is foolishness, this is rascaldom. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passers-by:</span> Good morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The scientists can give evidence that so much control has been gained. Now we can fly all over the world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then so much control, that is another thing. But not control. "So much control" means no control. (<span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...admitted that we are controlled by nature. That you cannot refuse. That is foolishness. Now, next, how nature is working? That is also replied in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram: [Bg. 9.10]</span> "The material nature is working..." Just like we are also taking the advantage of material nature, <span class="Italic">kṣity-ap-tejaḥ.</span> Here is earth, but we can take this earth and make into brick and make a skyscraper building. So it is not that the earth itself is going to become a skyscraper building. I am living entity; I am utilizing. So nature means these five elements, eight elements. So that has been manipulated by another living entity. Just like the aeroplane is a combination of some matter, but it is being worked out by the manufacturer, by the pilot. Therefore that driver of the aeroplane or the manufacturer of the..., he's superior. So superior to the material nature is Kṛṣṇa. This is the conclusion. [break] ...our position is that we are being controlled by the material nature, and, and nature, material nature, is controlled by Kṛṣṇa. So the sense is that one who is at all sensible, that "After all, the controller is Kṛṣṇa. So why not directly under control of Kṛṣṇa?" This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why through the material nature? I have to be controlled. I am being controlled by the material nature; and material nature is being controlled by Kṛṣṇa. So why not being directly controlled? This is good sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Kṛṣṇa is benevolent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Kṛṣṇa is benevolent, and the material nature is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, material nature... Just like you don't care for government. Then you be controlled by the jail superintendent. That's all. You'll be controlled. You cannot be free. But if you deny directly the control of the government then you must be controlled by the criminal department, by force. This is your position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Either to be controlled by love or by force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> One has a choice to either be controlled by love or by force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But love, there is no love when there is force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> No, but by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is love. Just like you are being controlled by me. There is no force. Voluntarily, out of love... I am not paying you. Still, if I say something, immediately you do. Why? There is love. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> One who actually understands the distinction, is it possible that he will still choose to be controlled by the material nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he has already chosen. But he's foolish. He does not know. He thinks that "I am now independent of the Supreme Lord." But because he's foolish, he cannot understand that you are not independent. You are being controlled by another agent of God. And because, although he's being controlled, he's thinking, "I am free," therefore he's in illusion. This is called illusion. Illusion means something which is not fact. That is illusion. So this materialist, the so-called scientist, he's thinking, "There is no God. We are independent." So many things, like rascal they are thinking. Foolish rascal, childish. And that is illusion. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimudhātmā.</span> Therefore this very word is used, <span class="Italic">vimūḍhātmā:</span> "befooled rascal." Actually, he's being controlled by material nature. So how to get out of this material nature? That is explained, <span class="Italic">mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te:</span> "As soon as that rascal surrenders unto Me, immediately he's out of control." Hare Kṛṣṇa. How these rascals, scientists, philosophers, politicians can refute this arrangement? Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Yes, they refuse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They refuse. That is..., means rascaldom. They do not actually understand the fact. How they can refuse? Every moment they are controlled by the material nature. Every step.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> The thing is that they do not realize. They are in illusion. They do not realize...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is... That means... Therefore we say they are rascals. They do not realize the fact. Therefore, rascal. Rascal means who do not understand the real fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say that we are also under the control of nature?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They don't see that we, that the devotee is actually free of the material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say, well, we also, we have to die, we have to grow old. Just because we're Hare Kṛṣṇas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But we admit that. But you don't admit that. Therefore you are foolish. We admit that "Yes, we are under control." That is the difference between you and me. But you don't admit. Therefore you are foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Usually, they admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Usually, they admit that death is certain. But the thing is that they say, what, that you can't do anything about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you are under control. You are not independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> But we say, "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa and you can become free," and they say, "No, I don't see that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore I say that a sensible man is that "I am controlled. I am controlled by some other agent of Kṛṣṇa. So why not be controlled directly by Kṛṣṇa." This is sense. I cannot be independent. Just like the government. If somebody says, "I don't agree to be controlled by you," then government will kick with police, with military. That is our position. We are being kicked by the agent of government, material nature. We are desiring in different way to become controller or enjoyer, and we are being offered different facilities, means different types of body, birth and death. So because they have no sense, they have accepted this process. So by the force of nature... "You wanted to desire. You desired this thing. All right, take this body. You wanted to eat without discrimination. All right, take this body of a pig and eat up to stool." That is nature's gift. So therefore he's changing. <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa brahmite kono bhāgyavān jīva.</span> He's going on changing, this dress that dress, that dress, that dress, that dress. But he's not in sense that "How I can stop this change?" That he doesn't know. Now, as Americans, they have so many nice facilities, but you cannot enjoy them. By nature's force, you'll have to change. What you can do? Today you are living on the twenty-fourth floor of this skyscraper, and tomorrow you may become a rat in that room. How you can change it? It is not in your power. The rat is also in the same room and you are also in the same room. Who has made this arrangement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> So they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The bug is also there. The mosquito is also there. The leader is also there. So, so many bodies, they are in the same room, but the enjoyment is not the same. Leaser's enjoyment is not exactly like the occupier of the room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> So they say that "Because life is temporary, let's live it up."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is foolish, another foolishness. That is... "You are beating me with your shoes. That's all right, it is temporary. That's all right. Let me go on suffering this." So that is foolishness. He does not think that "Why I have been subjected to be beaten by shoes, insult? All right, I do not mind. It is temporary." That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Well, they think that instead of being beaten that they're having fun, that it's pleasurable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless he's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> They think, "Let us have all the pleasure we can."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> illusion. Unless he thinks it is pleasurable, how he can tolerate? Just like the pig, eating stool. Everyone is thinking, "Aoww", but unless he thinks pleasurable, how he can eat? That is another concession of <span class="Italic">māyā. Praksepātmikā, āvaraṇātmikā.</span> He's covered by illusion. He is accepting the most abominable thing, but he's thinking, "I'm enjoying." This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Sometimes we tell them that this life is only full of miseries, and they say, "What do you mean?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is their foolishness. That is their foolishness. They do not know, they do not distinguish what is misery and what is happiness. They have no sense, no brain. That is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> So we can convince them by pointing out...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot convince them because they are so rascal, so foolish, that they have no brain to understand what is the distinction. They have no brain. Just like cats and dogs. That is their fallen condition. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Sudāmā:</span> They believe that this misery is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that I have explained. Unless they believe it is good, how they can be put in to miserable condition? Just like some of the thieves. They go to jail. They think, "It is very nice. We haven't got to earn. We are getting food here, free of charge. Yes, it is very nice place. It is my father-in-law's house." (laughs) So unless they believe, how they can tolerate such tribulations? The worm in the stool, he believes, "This is enjoyment." You take it from the stool, put it here, no, it will go again. It thinks it is pleasurable. That is their position. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhaḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> When they believe it, "Oh, it is not good," that is their good fortune. Then they are fortunate. That is explained by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa brahmite kono bhāgyavān jīva.</span> When they come to that fortunate position, that is first-class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> How does one become <span class="Italic">"bhāgyavān"?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāgyavān,</span> opulent... If you earn money, you become <span class="Italic">bhāgyavān. Bhāgyavān</span> means... The word has come from <span class="Italic">bhagavān,</span> and <span class="Italic">bhaga</span> means opulence, six kinds of opulence: riches... <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samagrasya vīryasya yaśasaḥ śriyaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="calibre3">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> 6.5.47)<span class="Italic">.</span> So one who possess all these things not exactly like Bhagavān, but partially, according to his position, he's called <span class="Italic">bhāgyavān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> But in this verse that you just quoted, <span class="Italic">ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa brahmite kono bhagyavān,</span> how does one come, become to the stage of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are making them <span class="Italic">bhāgyavān.</span> We are giving them service, how to become <span class="Italic">bhāgyavān.</span> We are spending our blood, gallons of blood, to make them <span class="Italic">bhāgyavān.</span> This is the sacrifice of the devotees. Just like you are poor. Somebody, rich man, comes, "All right, take one million dollars from me." You get immediately rich. So it is the devotees' sacrifice that they're becoming... Just like Vāsudeva Datta. He requested Caitanya Mahāprabhu, "My Lord, you have come. Take away all these people, unfortunate people, back to home, back to Godhead. If You think they are so inglorious, they cannot be taken, then give me all their sins to me. I shall suffer. You take them." That is Vaiṣṇava. They are sacrificing everything for these unfortunate rascals. Therefore they are becoming very, very dear to Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are sacrificing everything for giving, making fortunate these rascals, they become immediately very, very dear to Kṛṣṇa. Just like, if a rich man gives his money for public welfare, immediately he's recognized by the government, "Yes." He's given some title. Why? Because he has given his possession for the benefit of the public. Similarly, the devotees, they are distributing their possessions to these unfortunate people. Therefore he's immediately recognized. That is the process. But devotee does not want any recognition, but he knows that "My Lord wants this rascal to go back to home, back to Godhead. So let me try my best." He knows the mind of the master; otherwise, why the master comes and canvasses, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">?</span> He has no business, but He wants that "These rascals are suffering in this material condition. They are My part and parcel, My sons. Let Me try." And devotee understands that "My Lord wants it. So let me do it on His behalf." Therefore devotee is so dear. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... (end)</div>
