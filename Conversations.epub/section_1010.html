<div class="Normal-Level">(much background noise)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Speak loudly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's very noisy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> This is Dr. Ghosh. This is Visukeran(?) Agarwal, one of our very close friends in Hyderabad. He's a very close friend in Hyderabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I have seen you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Oh, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Ghosh. (conversation in Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ghosh:</span> And he knows about Parikana(?). It's a very wonderful place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I shall go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> There are very, very big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Ghosh:</span> (Bengali conversation with Prabhupāda)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think they are ordinary calf?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> To be embraced by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are associates. They are associating with Lord as calf, as cow. <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhis tābhir ya eva nija-rūpatayā kalābhiḥ [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">. Nija-rūpa.</span> (Guest speaks in Bengali, Prabhupāda English) In Vṛndāvana, the trees, the land, the water-everyone, <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-rasa-pratibhāvitābhiḥ.</span> That is expansion of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual energy. <span class="Italic">Cit-śakti.</span> There are three energies: spiritual, material, and marginal. So Vṛndāvana affairs means expansion of Kṛṣṇa's spiritual energy. <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.</span> <span class="Italic">Sac-cid-ānanda. Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa. Rasa,</span> mellow. Everyone is trying to relish some mellow. Here in this material world we get family to taste some mellows. One kind of mellow is wife, one kind of mellow are children, one kind of mellow is the servants, one kind of mellow is the friends, one kind of mellow is the properties. They are all mellows, <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> Unless there is some taste, why one should be hankering after all these things? Why one is hankering after some woman or some man or some friends or for children? One who has got no children, he's hankering after some child. He's expecting, "When I shall get a child?" The <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> There is husband-wife <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> but there is no <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of the child. Therefore they are praying, "When we shall get a child?" So there is another <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> So <span class="Italic">raso vai saḥ.</span> He is the reservoir of <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> So if we derive all the <span class="Italic">rasas</span> from the Supreme, because He is the reservoir of <span class="Italic">rasas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Akhila-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Akhila-rasāmṛta,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Akhila-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span> So you can have all the <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> That is the origin of <span class="Italic">bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu.</span> In <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> that <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> you become in the ocean of <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> You're hankering after <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> There is a Vedic injunction, <span class="Italic">raso vai saḥ labdhvānandi ānandī.(?)</span> One who has got the <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> <span class="Italic">labdhvānandi,</span> then he gets the real <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> That <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-rasa</span> expansion is Kṛṣṇa's calves, cows, <span class="Italic">gopī</span> friends, cowherd boy friends, Nanda, Yaśodāmāyi, so many. So to be Kṛṣṇa conscious means to participate with these <span class="Italic">rasas.</span> It is not dry. It is not dry like, simply <span class="Italic">so 'ham, so'ham. So 'ham,</span> they do not know the meaning. <span class="Italic">So 'ham</span> means I belong to the same <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> I also eligible to enjoy the same <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> But Kṛṣṇa is... [break] ...and the calves, the cows are enjoying the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> as predominated. Just like husband and wife, they are enjoying, both. But one is enjoying as the husband, predominator. The husband is forcefully dragging the wife. She's also... While she is dragged by force, she enjoys. That is another <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> But there is <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> Combined together it becomes <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> Similarly Kṛṣṇa does not enjoy this material. This material <span class="Italic">rasa</span> is the perverted reflection of that <span class="Italic">cinmaya-rasa.</span> So we have to get ourselves nil of all these material <span class="Italic">rasas</span> and we have to be situated in the <span class="Italic">cinmaya.</span> Then our, <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> Then our life is perfect. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Rasa</span> is there. Here perverted reflection. This perverted reflection... My Guru Mahārāja used to say to taste milk in white lime water. White lime water, it looks like milk. But it is not milk. It is different thing. Similarly, we are trying to taste the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> of milk in lime water. Therefore we are baffled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is true. Whole universe is <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> Even in Mars they're trying to find humidity. What is humidity, <span class="Italic">rasa.</span> Everything is moving on the <span class="Italic">rasa</span> only. We are floating on <span class="Italic">rasa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our aim of understanding this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, it is not a sentiment. It is a great science, great science. Otherwise how we are writing so many books? If it was a dry...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Nothing happens in dryness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why people are accepting our books? You'll be surprised we are selling book to the extent of six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees per day. Daily. Daily we are selling six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees' worth all over the world. So people think philosophy, religion is dry subject matter. If it was dry subject matter, how they could purchase so many books? It is <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-rasa.</span> They are getting for the first time. Here is real <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> Therefore they are appreciating. Everyone, learned circle, they are appreciation. In (indistinct) foreign circles. So, there was no such literature. It is the first time. <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-bhāgavatam amalaṁ purāṇaṁ vaiṣṇavānām...</span> So unless, they're really relishing some <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> how they are purchasing? This is the first distribution of <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-rasa</span> throughout the whole world, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So I am very happy that you are also joining. Let us join together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We can consult and fix a date, what suits Prabhupāda best, then I will arrange for the rest at that date.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> When are you leaving Hyderabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I'm leaving just after... You see I was leaving long ago, but he was coming. So I will leave 19th morning plane. That is the day after the <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī</span> tomorrow. Night, whatever festivity I'll be here. I think there will be some <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> also. After that, early morning, I'll catch the plane and go up to Madras and there I shall fly again to Mathila.(?) It is not very far, as you are thinking, but (Bengali) ...to recharge. Because they are recharging the battery of the urban line. But they also will be recharging that battery in a nice cosmic place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-rasa,</span> our <span class="Italic">rasa,</span> it can be tasted by the topmost intellectual man and it can be tasted by the lowest...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No intellect at all. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why? Because this intellect, highest or lowest, that is in relationship with the body. But it is beyond the body. It is not... <span class="Italic">sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is beyond the three <span class="Italic">guṇas.</span> The body is of the material <span class="Italic">guṇas-sattva, rajas, tamas.</span> One man is good man, one man is passionate, one is foolish. <span class="Italic">Guṇa. Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo'sya. Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān</span> [Bg. 13.22]<span class="Italic">? </span>Find out this. <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi.</span> Everything is explained. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is matchless. We are reading and re-reading, and every time we find much more, you see? Terrific. And you have put the simplest method-"as it is" as you say. Why complicate, tinker this... That is why... You know we can be safely called intellectuals. But you know we are tired of it. Tired. We cannot find anything. <span class="Italic">Neti neti vicāra te patra patra...</span> Impossible. Then what do you get out of the life? The joy, <span class="Italic">rasa</span> (Bengali) And that is the main substance. To get it you cannot get <span class="Italic">neti neti</span> (Bengali)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi</span> [Bg. 13.22]<span class="Italic">. Puruṣaḥ.</span> Why you cannot find this verse? What you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaḥ prakṛti, bhuñjante...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tad guṇān. Puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi.</span> You did not find?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> series twenty volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Seventeen volumes. Seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I have only two. Can I, is there any set available? I would like to buy the rest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">puruṣaḥ prakṛti-stho hi<br class="calibre2"/>bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān<br class="calibre2"/>kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya<br class="calibre2"/>sad-asad-yoni-janmasu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 13.22]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣa,</span> the living entity, he is now within the material energy. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti-sthaḥ. Puruṣaḥ prakṛti...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhuṅkte prakṛti-jān guṇān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On account of his being in touch with the material energy, he has to suffer or enjoy the modes of material nature. Modes of material nature. And because, just like in your medical science one is suffering from a certain type of disease on account of his being infected by the similar verus or..., what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Virus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Virus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Virus. (Bengali) Now we know even the inanimate is animate, but by biology only it is changing. All the unanimate subject is slowly being transformed into animate. We are all convinced the whole process is the same. It's a terrific science now, biology. Latest, we have discovered. I am also working on biology quite a bit for all the virus disease and all. And we can eliminate them by only vacuum. My whole cure, they call it miracle and all is nonsense, it is only creating a vacuum which automatically takes away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This biology will be complete...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> When we accept this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...when you accept this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know. (laughs) And I have accepted long ago. Because I felt, as a sincere worker, medicine doesn't interest me. What interests me is the cure. My profession is to cure, not to study the medicines. That is the cure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here it is very clearly stated that <span class="Italic">kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> The biology, infection. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇam,</span> that is the <span class="Italic">kāraṇam. Kāraṇam guṇa-saṅgo 'sya sad-asad-janma-yoniṣu.</span> Why there are varieties of life? One is very intelligent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You know also in (Sanskrit).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Same thing, no? Everything has light. Only it is in transformation by that formula it is inanimate to animate. That is what is happening all around us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if from... Just like medical science... It is also a medical science. <span class="Italic">Bhavauṣadhi.</span> It is... <span class="Italic">auṣadhi</span> means medical science. This is <span class="Italic">bhavauṣadhi.</span> By this treatment one becomes relieved from the material disease. <span class="Italic">Bhavauṣadhi. Bhavauṣadhāc chrotra-mano-'bhirāmāt.</span> But the medicine is so nice that it is pleasing to the ears and to the heart. The medicine pleasing to the ear? What is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Hari-nāma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali) We decide a date, and take... Not too... We have no means for having too many people, but about dozen people, or ten people can come. And they will have all facility. We can arrange a station wagon and everything there. You have to come up to Kore Canal(?) Road Station. And if you like we shall arrange for your departure from Madras. We will come with you. We will accompany you all the way. (Bengali conversation interspersed) When you come there I'll get everything ready. It is settled you are coming at there earliest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When they'll make program, conveniently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I'm leaving on 29th morning. If you can give me a word by tomorrow evening. Not 29th, 19th. Today is 17th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot decide so soon. <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī kare,</span> another program is that we are going that side during (indistinct). So we have to see. You also send this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁśa:</span> Yes, I have to take little time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. Please come in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indians:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda <span class="Italic">ki jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> He's a life member from Bangalore. He was one of our first members in South India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I saw you? Give them <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Last night at the airport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They had <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi or Bengali)</div>
<div class="Verse">bhagavad-bhakti-hīnasya<br class="calibre2"/>jātiḥ śāstraṁ japas tapaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>aprāṇasyeva dehasya<br class="calibre2"/>maṇḍanaṁ loka-rañjanam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Without <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti,</span> this so-called advancement of civilization is simply decorating the dead body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Correct. Cent percent correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the use of decorating the dead body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Correct. Yes. We must decorate real...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And this body is... Either dead or alive, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> condemns, <span class="Italic">gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> So these rascals are interested with this body, and they're proud of their advancement of education. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says <span class="Italic">nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> So they are passing as great scientists, philosophers, politicians, philanthropists, but all <span class="Italic">apaṇḍitāḥ. Nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ.</span> That means <span class="Italic">apaṇḍita.</span> (Bengali) The first thing of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> lesson is that <span class="Italic">aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādān [</span>Bg. 2.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Talking like a learned man, but you are rascal." <span class="Italic">Apaṇḍitaḥ.</span> One who is not educated, he's a rascal. So He's indirectly saying, "This kind of lamentation is not for the <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> It is for the rascal." So whole world is interested with this body, and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā's</span> teaching begins condemning the concept of body. <span class="Italic">Gatāsūn agatāsūṁś ca nānuśocanti paṇḍitāḥ. Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Nobody knows this. And they are very learned scholars in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> All these rascals, they're claiming to be learned scholar of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We are lucky souls that we are surrendered souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Whatever is done it is by single man's effort. If all our actual leaders, they take up, then India will be glorified. They'll feel... Yes, they're expecting. Outside India, people, they expect that there is something better knowledge in India. Therefore as soon as some swamis or yogi goes there, they come. But they cheat. These rascals, I shall say that, they do not know anything, and they go there for teaching yoga. Bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Bogus, bogus. So many bogus people are going.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They do not know what is what. What that is truth. They don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And they get cheap money and women and that's all. That is their business. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> He has a temple. The whole third floor of his house is a temple. He has Sītā-Rāma, Kṛṣṇa, Gopāla. He has big temple. They have <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> every night. Every morning and night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Bengali conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> That Raṅganātha temple is that temple where they do not allow us in. So Sampat Kumar and all of these <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas,</span> they will sign one letter trying to request them. Also with the Purī people. To request them to let us in. While they are all here they will do that. Also Sampat Kumar was thinking that in November and December in South India the weather is nice because the rainy season is finished, and it would be a very good time to go and visit many of the temples. He personally knows many people in all the big temples. Shri Rangam, Kañcipuram, Maha Balipuram, Tirupati. They could arrange for receptions and programs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) South India, Indian culture is still there. Other parts of India, they are not now Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Correct. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got buses. They have got buses, two, three. Any number of. It is very simple method. That we combine together, Indian and foreigners. Go in buses. (Bengali) Now it should be organized. This is simply (Bengali).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You must also come in Bangalore once. Then it will be all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Immediately think over that. These Europeans, Americans are there. Now get up the association of another, at least one dozen, and let us go together, <span class="Italic">grāma</span> to <span class="Italic">grāma,...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> We could go from Madras...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Anywhere. Any village. All the villages...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You start from anywhere and go anywhere and sit down and chant. In India, <span class="Italic">Bhārata-bhūmi</span> (Hindi). Thousands will come. That is India. You won't have to advertise that there is <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana,</span> come. No. As soon as you begin, immediately thousands. As soon as there will be sugar grain, immediately the ants will come. It is like that. This is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Correct, correct. Hundred per cent correct.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) Just get one dozen good, I mean, good or bad. It doesn't matter, who is ready to work for this purpose. And our men are ready. Our buses are ready. So let us go. There is no question of selecting place. Anywhere. Anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Any place, anywhere, all the places.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go and find out some good place for camping and begin <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Get down from the bus and begin <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Then all friends will come immediately.
