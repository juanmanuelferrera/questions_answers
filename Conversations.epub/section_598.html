<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (in car:) ...dark?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> It seems to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cloudy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Very cloudy today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yeah, it's cloudy. [break] ...June in the history of Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes. It was warmer in January, the paper says, than now. During the day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...this warm. But it is cold. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In London, when I came there, the weather was very sunny and bright. It was very pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Here the sun goes down at eleven o'clock and it gets up at four o'clock. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three hours. I was there. Up to eleven o'clock at night there is sun, and then perhaps twelve or half past twelve, there is night. That is also not full dark. And at three o'clock, again sun. So many hours? Eleven to three. [break] ...above Sweden there is no night tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no day?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. [break] ...sociological problems there. Because when it's all night, people become very depressed and there's a high suicide rate. So they have been trying to have these artificially lights to light up the cities and make it appear as if it was daytime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Why not just make one big sun, big scientists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Still they do not accept God. [break] <span class="Italic">...ājñayā bhramati sambhṛta-kāla-cakro.</span> Everything is. [break] ...cribing the whole universal situation, Śukadeva Gosvāmī concluded, "as God has made it." He never mentioned any other demigod. "As God has made it." <span class="Italic">Yathā bhagavān kriyetām</span> [break] ...not to accept the authority of Kṛṣṇa, misfortune. <span class="Italic">Narādhama.</span> [break] (walking:) <span class="Italic">...kara bhai, ara saba mithyā, palaya patha nara yo mache piche</span>(?): "Everyone should take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Remember, behind you there is the Yamarāja, death." [break] ...to avoid this horrible conception that there is death, and they avoid this, that "There is death, but there is no life again." That's all. [break] ...this dog race and what is the rat race? There is a word, rat race?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> That describes the modern culture. Everyone runs around like rats in a maze, looking for food. It's a psychological test. They put rats in a maze and at one end of the maze they put some food. So the rats run all through the maze trying to find the food. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...this side, Hawaii?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. [break] What is the news of Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Vṛndāvana is very nice. Twenty-four hour <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is going on there regularly, and Akṣayānanda Mahārāja is out collecting. He went to Kanpur with a party of men to make life members.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Visitors are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Visitors are beginning to come. Even though there is no advertisement, they are beginning to come, and their general attitude is that they're very pleased with the building. They like it very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many visitors come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Well, daily three families will be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Every evening <span class="Italic">āratika</span> there are almost one hundred visitors at evening <span class="Italic">āratika.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Pradyumna? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> I have heard many people in Vṛndāvana say that our temple is the best in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> There's no more beautiful temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Especially the Deities. They are most impressed by the beautiful Deities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are dressing nicely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes, very nicely. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have decided to finish these seventeen books pending, within two months. So make your program, how to do it. It must be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> You're including the Fifth Canto. Is that right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> You're including the Fifth Canto when you say seventeen books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. Fifth Canto also by the end of August, for <span class="Italic">Vyāsa-pūjā</span> day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhā-vallabha:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...amṛta,</span> that is thirteen more books. <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> is sixteen volumes altogether. So we have already finished four. So that's twelve plus maybe four to five <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> [break] Now that Nitāi and Jagannātha are here, it may be possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...may be, must be. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> The only difficulty we face in editing is that sometimes there are problems that come up which we can't figure out ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I shall remain here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> If you remain here, then we can finish very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. [break] There was some defect in the roof. They are repairing?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How much, how long they do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> They do for about twenty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes. Then afterwards Tulasī worship and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> People stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes. End of the class. The whole evening is taken up by <span class="Italic">ārati,</span> class...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Who gives the class in the evening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> The devotees trade off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> In English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes. And beginning at six o'clock in the evening they have Hindi class.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What Praṇava does?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Sambhunātha Paṇḍita also gives.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Praṇava?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Praṇava doesn't usually give, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He stays there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is there any news of the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No word. Gopāla Kṛṣṇa has not been there in Vṛndāvana. He has been in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was entrusted to Praṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Oh, Praṇava has not said anything, sent any word with me. Viśvambhara is very enthusiastic for starting the Gurukula there. He has said that he can give more than a <span class="Italic">lakh</span> in order to build a building. Previously he promised a <span class="Italic">lakh</span> but he said that there is more money he can continually give for supporting the Gurukula there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I have sent news to Praṇava to complete the negotiation, and he has done nothing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> I don't know whether he has done or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...doctor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> The doctor is staying there. He is... [break] ...for a few days and stays, and then he goes for a few days. Then he comes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Pradyumna is doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Pradyumna has gone to Māyāpur to help train the Sastris.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> To teach the Sastris English, he has gone to Māyāpur. They have all gone to Māyāpur because they were facing criticism from the residents of Vṛndāvana. Many of their old schoolmates were criticizing that they are coming and joining us. These are... [break] ...are very desirous of taking initiation from you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Ananta Ram Sastri and one other, I forget his name. He is very, very good in Sanskrit. He reads it fluently, speaks it fluently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He speaks Sanskrit also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yes. Speaks it. He lectures in Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> While he was in Vṛndāvana, we were taking daily a class with him in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> We would read Viśvanātha Cakravartī's commentary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is our car? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...they would help us acquire land for a Gurukula. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...sent Praṇava, how is that there is no news about the land? (end)</div>
