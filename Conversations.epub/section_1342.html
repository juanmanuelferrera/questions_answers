<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, that legal business?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Girirāja has gone into Mathurā to meet with Mr. Garg to just see that all of the drafts are in order, if everything is in order. Then hopefully tomorrow we can finish it all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it was argument, not that we have rejected. <span class="Italic">Upāyān cintayet prajñāḥ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean the treatment? Yes, I have learned to take everything very philosophically, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean I took it that you were presenting the..., you know, presenting the whole picture to be considered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am now puzzled. Still, I am thinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I thought it was very good what you said in the sense that it... It actually makes everything... It presents a more real picture. We should not be overly optimistic, neither should we be completely fatalistic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And above all, our whole program here is completely transcendental. It's just like Kṛṣṇa dāsa Bābājī said. Your consciousness is so sublime that it's just wonderful at every moment to be with you. I mean, although I wish that you were... We all wish that you were completely healthy, yet at the same time we have never experienced so much nice exchanges with you. I mean we all... Every moment is so relishable to be with you. So I mean, even this puzzlement is very transcendental. None of us see any of this in any kind of a mundane view. It's all due to your consciousness being so Kṛṣṇa conscious, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I mean to me this puzzlement is simply another proof of the existence of Kṛṣṇa, 'cause Kṛṣṇa certainly is not puzzled. It seems like everything is happening according to His plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kīrtana</span> may be stopped now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stop for a while now. For the rest of the night it's good if there's... (<span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> stops) The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>'s assistant came this evening. We hadn't called him. I think he came on his own. He wanted to see how you were. I didn't think there was so much need for him to see you. He's not so senior a man. And the medicine is already prescribed, so what would be the benefit of his coming? We're not going to allow him to change the medicine, so I felt there was no real need. We can... Bhakti-caru Mahārāja spoke with him, gave him report of how you are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is also educated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't really know, Śrīla Prabhupāda, how far he's educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Seems too young also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Young and... We're pretty lucky, as far as I can see, with that Damodar Prasad Shastri. He seems to be in his own category from all the <span class="Italic">kavirājas</span> I've ever seen. He really seems different than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> He's also Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He really is a little Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That... The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> that we brought from Calcutta. He's... The thing I liked about him also is I felt that he was the kind of person who I... Somehow I felt that in your childhood or something, that your family would have engaged some such a Marwari... You always said how the Mulliks' house was located amongst many Marwari community people. I was thinking somehow it seemed suitable that this is... Of course we don't designate like that, but somehow it seems suitable that... You know. Marwaris are... They occupy a high place in the community. Everything they do, they do very first class. Their food is first class. They do first-class business. Most of our members are from the Marwari community. Anyway, it just seemed like it was nice that this man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their food is first class, there is no doubt. Yes... It is certified by Sir P. C. Raya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> By who, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A big chemist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What was his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sir P. C. Raya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> P. C. Raya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> A chemist, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. He's the first chemist who started this Bengal Chemical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said first-class food is Marwari, and last class, Madrasi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Madras.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Last class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Madrasi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> I like this doctor too, Śrīla Prabhupāda, because he was respectful to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Not only to Prabhupāda. They're always respectful to Prabhupāda. But that he was respectful to the devotees. That was the sign that actually he was respectful to Prabhupāda, because many of them, they show respect to Śrīla Prabhupāda, but they don't respect the devotees, which means they don't really respect what Śrīla Prabhupāda has done. He had a very good appreciation. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I had some stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Earlier today. That also, I see by the writing, was good color. Actually that's a good sign, that it's being passed naturally, without any artificial means. You may be feeling relief from that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The stool which I was proposing came out by juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Came out naturally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Did Prabhupāda have barley and milk tonight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, I got it ready. I just came to ask. Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Now you can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I'm always near by. I'm in the house all the time. [break] One thing I feel, that while there hasn't been any great improvement, on the other hand, I do not find that there has been any negative reaction or any regression since the time the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>'s treatment began. Of course, Your Divine Grace says that you feel weaker now than you did a week ago. If that's a fact, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not so very weak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I do find that you have more difficulty sitting up now. I notice that when you sit up you always slump over to one side, either as if you have no sufficient strength or as if you lost your balance. I can't tell which it is. You're always leaning. You're not able to sit up straight. Of course, that was there also even a week ago, but it seems a little more noticeable now. Do you think you are weaker now than you were a week ago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You do? That's not a good sign. I mean I wouldn't expect that you should be that much stronger, but I don't see why you should be weaker now. Do you think it may be psychologically that you're weaker? I mean, how would you know if you were weaker now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I cannot sit down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can't sit up. You mean after being sat up you can't stay sitting up? You were never able to sit yourself up. That you were not doing since many months ago. When you say you're not able to sit down, you mean you cannot keep sitting in a sitting position? 'Cause that you were able to do in the last day or two, sitting up. It might be... I don't know, but it may be more psychological, from laying in bed all the time. Naturally there is a feeling perhaps that one is... Weakness also means one's willpower becomes more weaker. Is that possible that that may be it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What it is, Kṛṣṇa knows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, the signs which the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> told us to look for, which would show that things are going well, are definitely present. The fact is that you have been passing more urine every day, nearly double the amount that you previously were passing. And also you're not exerting yourself as much. Up until a week ago you were speaking a lot, translating or otherwise, and this <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> you were doing was also exerting. So in that respect you're not exerting yourself as much. In other words, all of the things which the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> has asked us to do, we're doing and you're doing. So we should now wait and see. In the meantime, we're here chanting. If you like, we can read. And we're perfectly satisfied to be with you. So I don't see that there's any difficulty in waiting to see the results of the treatment, see if it has actually helped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> I asked him if he would like to take some medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda's supposed to take medicine now? He doesn't want to take? You don't want to take your medicine now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My taking the medicine means I am passing urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, according to every physician that we've consulted, Ayurvedic and allopathic, they say that that's very much required. Is it painful to pass urine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think you should take the medicine as he prescribed. They're not dangerous medicines in any way. Otherwise we won't be able to see the effect of the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span>'s treatment. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali with Bhakti-caru)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda said that when he turns on his side he feels dizzy, and when he sits up also, towards the beginning, he feels very dizzy. I think that's due to weakness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, according to this <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> he said that after fifteen days of this treatment, there should be noticeable sign, increased strength. Didn't he say that? So, it's been about one week now, hasn't it? Or maybe not so long. Five days. So for another week or ten days, Śrīla Prabhupāda, we should carry on, and let us see. We're certainly not going to... I think that this is the last <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> that we should take the help of. If his medicine works, that's very welcome. And if it doesn't, then I don't think that we should try any more <span class="Italic">kavirājas</span> or any doctor. We've tried enough. At least for the next week to ten days now we should carry through. At least we've seen that with other <span class="Italic">kavirājas</span> there were so many negative effects. Remember? Now, with this <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> nothing has even happened badly with the medicine he's prescribed. Rather, exactly as he predicted there would be more urine, more urine is coming. I think the swelling is reducing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. It has. It's a lot... Another thing is that milk...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Milk you were never able to take. Now you're able to take without producing... I mean there definitely are, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last night you gave me milk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Um hm. You started coughing, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Last night</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> About 8:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda was vomiting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Not really. Like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> See, Śrīla Prabhupāda, I explained to Bhakti-caru Mahārāja that when you take something to drink, milk, that when you sit up, at first you should not eat immediately. First of all, you should sit up... [break] I don't think it was due to the milk and barley that you were coughing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> There are few things. First of all that, as you say, sitting up and taking it immediately after sitting up, and when he was feeling dizzy, then drinking the milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's what it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And another thing is that no taste. And Śrīla Prabhupāda wasn't sitting properly. He was very uncomfortable, the way he was sitting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what I'm trying to say. Before you try to drink anything, Śrīla Prabhupāda, first of all you make yourself properly comfortable in sitting. If you're dizzy and you try and drink... Anyone who is dizzy and tries to drink, they're going to start to cough and vomit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Another thing might have been that last night in the milk the barley was little thick, little too much of it, so that density was little thick. So from today onwards I'm going to use much less barley so that it's thin and easy to swallow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think that... I mean the one thing we're hoping for is the strength. I was saying that the swelling, Śrīla Prabhupāda, very much reduced, very reduced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> And another thing, Shastriji was explaining that in Ayurvedic medicine the reaction doesn't take place immediately. He was explaining in allopath, when someone is very weak, they give him glucose, intravenous glucose, and that gives immediate energy. But he says that that doesn't work. When the glucose is exhausted, then again he becomes even more weaker. But the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> like that, the strength will come slowly, slowly, but whatever strength is acquired in the body, that stays there. It's permanent. It's not just temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The swelling is reduced. Isn't it, Śrīla Prabhupāda? I mean, all of the signs, Śrīla Prabhupāda, which the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> wanted, are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> As a matter of fact, he hasn't given any medicine to strengthen him up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Did you hear what Bhakti-caru just said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Right now, Śrīla Prabhupāda, Shastriji didn't give you any medicine to strengthen you up as such. His medicines are simply to cure your kidney and liver. When they are cured, then he's going to give medicines like <span class="Italic">makara-dhvaja</span> which will make you strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda, this is one of the reasons I wanted the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> to be with you was to be able to answer your doubts, because I felt that he could far better than we can. But factually speaking, it seems to me there's every... I mean if he were here now he would feel your pulse and he would be able to understand that your pulse is not weak. Your heart is good. You're starting to pass more urine, you're getting sufficient rest, you're able to take things like milk, which you couldn't take before, and these are positive signs. And the one thing that we're looking for, strength, he already said will not come immediately, and he's not even giving any medicine for increasing strength yet. The thing is, we're a little impatient because we've waited so many months and had so many failures with so many different doctors, but really, this doctor, so far, has the best record, his medicines. So we think that you should be encouraged. We feel hopeful. Even if you feel hopeless, we are hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali with Bhakti-caru)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That's 40 grams, stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I think you should take the medicine now. Can Bhakti-caru bring it to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This same medicine will continue till <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> comes back and gives new medicine. They are all the same medicine, Śrīla Prabhupāda. There are two different types of medicines. One, I'm supposed to give once in the morning, once in the evening. And another one is in the noontime and late in the evening. And there's one medicine, that's sometime in the afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not very painful to take the medicine, is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Does it taste bad, Śrīla Prabhupāda, the medicine? Does it taste very bad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> But then it is very bitter or... Because medicine will be a little bad tasting. Very much bitter, no, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bitter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. So should I mix it with some sweet? Like... I normally give the powder with glucose so that the glucose will give you some sweet taste. But distilled medicine, the water thin, watery medicine, that is tasteless. It tastes like water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Let us follow this medicine until its prescribed time, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give me. (swallows medicine)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> feels quite confident, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He is not a fool. He says there's reason to feel quite hopeful. Naturally you are feeling a little hopeless because you've been laying down for so long in bed. Would you like to hear a little bit of one of the books? We'll read some more of the <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Kapila</span> that we were reading yesterday to you? In this way we can pass the time very nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're moving the light over to this side for reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> This book is wonderful, Prabhupāda, Kapila, <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Kapila.</span> It is a beautiful cover. (Jayādvaita reads from <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Kapila</span>) (end)</div>
