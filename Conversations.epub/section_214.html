<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Māyā-sukhāya</i>, for flickering happiness arranging huge paraphernalia, just like for sporting, restaurants(?), so many things. <i class="calibre3">Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.9.43]. No use. There is no use, but sporting, for frivolous sporting as we saw yesterday. Beginning from the morning working, so many people are engaged, but they do not know the value of arranging <i class="calibre3">maṅgala-ārati</i>. They do not know. (laughter) <i class="calibre3">Māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.9.43]. Making huge arrangement. What for? Only flickering happiness, that's all. <i class="calibre3">Vimūḍhā</i>, rascals. Therefore, Prahlāda Maharaja says, "I don't think for myself; I am simply anxious for these rascals who are engaged in huge affair for some flickering happiness.'' <i class="calibre3">Śoce tato vimukha-cetasa</i>, <i class="calibre3">māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.9.43]. (chants <i class="calibre3">japa</i>) [break] Construct a very nice temple in this open park, people will come in the morning and they will see the <i class="calibre3">maṅgala-ārati</i>, take <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i>. That would have been good for this life and the next life. And what are they doing?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> They're simply miserable, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're going to be cats and dogs and trees. They don't believe that there is life after death, so they think that "Whatever we have got now, let us enjoy sense.'' And the university education is giving them facility, "Yes, take education and gratify your senses from the age of twelve years.'' And at the last stage they think that "I would have liked that one would have shot me down on my head.'' What that old lady was talking?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa(?):</span> Oh, yes. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> She said if someone else didn't shoot her, she would. She'd just do herself in.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hopeless life. <i class="calibre3">Māyā-sukhāya</i>. Because they waste their time simply for flickering happiness, in future everything is zero. <i class="calibre3">Śūnyavādī</i>, <i class="calibre3">nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi</i>. <i class="calibre3">Śūnyavādī</i> means whose ultimate goal is zero. <i class="calibre3">Pāścātya-deśa</i>, Western countries. <i class="calibre3">Nirviśeṣa-śūnyavādi</i>. (chants <i class="calibre3">japa</i>) Every one of you should take this movement very seriously and save your country. Misguided. <i class="calibre3">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānas<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.5.31]. (laughs) Blind men. This Nixon is a rascal number one, and he's the president. Just see. They have no other selection. All the people are rascals, and they must select one rascal to become their guider, another big rascal. (devotees chant <i class="calibre3">japa</i>) [break] ...from Māyāpur?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (Karāndhara?)(3):</span> Yes. The one you've written, from the old Book Trust?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They have sent one account.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Oh, yes, I reviewed that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I reviewed it. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think it is all right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Appears to be in order.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Everything appears to be in order.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Anything irregular, you should immediately ask them to explain. At least there must be some check.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> I sent Bhavānanda a letter yesterday explaining that would be the last of the cash; the rest would come in books.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Books you can take as much you like. There is (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like all the men, they are spending two thousand rupees for maintenance. They must work. And if they go with the books to any gentleman, they'll take. <i class="calibre3">Māyā-sukhāya udvahato vimūḍhān</i>. [break] Americans are giving so much service, knowledge. Arrange everything. They are giving already; simply they should be distributed through us-powdered milk, grains. People will feel so much obliged, "Oh, these American people are giving us knowledge and food.'' Practically they'll see how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious-by our <i class="calibre3">aratika</i>, by our <i class="calibre3">kīrtana</i>, by our behavior, by our character. Not only in India-everywhere. This is real service to the human.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> The government is spending millions of dollars to control the drug problem. In every city there are heroin addicts and all kinds of addicts, and they are very perplexed because there is no way to control.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the only way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> This is the only way, but they are not willing to listen. Recently I was in Washington talking to the officials. Our company is making a project for the government, $7,000,000 to investigate what is the best way. And every way it costs thousands of dollars for each person, and it's not even guaranteed. And they take them out of heroin and they are putting them on methadone or some other chemical drug, and that's their method. They are spending thousands and thousands of dollars and the person goes back to addiction after several years. No success. Our program costs nothing, and the politicians don't want to listen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Their policy is that they want to keep the people in that way-rascals and fools-then they'll vote and they'll enjoy the political power. That is their policy. Actually they do not want to see their countrymen elevated good character. They don't want to see. If the people become... Just like the British government in their time, they wanted to give education. Their education means A-B-C-D-half, mediocre, so that the government may be run on. They require clerks, servants, so much, not high education. As soon as there was question of high education, they stopped. And actually it so happened that as soon as the Indian people became highly educated and they learned the history of the world, they kicked them out. So these people, these rascals, Nixon and company, they want to keep the people in ignorance so that they'll get vote and enjoy. If the people become intelligent <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i>, then immediately he'll be kicked out. What is his value? He has no value. This is policy. They don't want to see that people become elevated in knowledge. That is not their policy. Therefore, they do not agree. Actually they are seeing that "These Hare Kṛṣṇa people, they're so nice character, they're religion, God conscious, so if all people become like this, then where we are?'' Because as soon as people become Kṛṣṇa conscious, they'll noncooperate with the slaughterhouse, liquor industry, gambling, illicit sex. They will noncooperate. Then the whole plan of civilization will be collapsed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> Their biggest industry is the war industry.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> War, killing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, how they can (indistinct)? They do not know and do not actually want to see people enlightened. It is not their policy. It is simply make some show. Show means spend another set-up amount, investigation. Their men, the government men, they'll get money, that's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> <i class="calibre3">Jaya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And finished. Engage some rascal report. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> Exactly, exactly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very dangerous.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> They are all thieves, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Thieves, stealing from each other.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. They don't want to see people very enlightened. "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss.'' But at least how to become wise, that injunction has been given to you. Now you try to save the country, how to do it. These people will not be. You'll have to educate the people, and they'll vote you to the senators, president, and then your country will be nice. Just like by Kurukṣetra, Kṛṣṇa smashed all Duryodhana and company, and He posted Yudhiṣṭhira Mahārāja. That is the Kṛṣṇa's politics. He wanted to smash all these demons and have His own men posted on the royal throne. When Kali could not penetrate into the daily behavior of the people, he planned killing of Parīkṣit Maharaja. So, one Kali <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇa</i> cursed him to death, for no fault practically. Therefore the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i> of this age, they are condemned. The so-called caste <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i>, they're condemned. That is lamented by the father of the boy who cursed Parīkṣit Maharaja. (<i class="calibre3">japa</i>) (end)</div>
