<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That reporter wanted to talk more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes. He spoke with me for another one hour, very interested. And he writes for many different magazines also, not just one magazine. He's called "free-lance writer."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He understands our philosophy, but he is not ready to surrender. He very much appreciated the dioramas that Bharadvāja is working on. We took him over to see them. Every one of the newspapermen was anxious to get a story on the opening of the museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Very prestigious, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Museum."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In everywhere, every center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Museum, library...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then, eventually, Bharadvāja wants to have big museum in the city, not necessarily in our building, because the building may not have enough space. Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think it will be more prestigious if we use the art paintings to be displayed in museums or art galleries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That way, wealthy, upper-class people will get a chance to appreciate. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...said that beef-eating is the cause of cancer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Too much addicted. (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> This cancer problem seems to be increasing. Previously only old.... We would only hear of old people getting it. Now young people are getting it also. It is becoming very common.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Young people also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes, two, one girl here got it. Another girl was suspected of having it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the symptom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Generally, with women, they get some lump...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Pain, the symptom is lump and great pain. Cancer is said to be some bacteria or virus cells that are inside the body, eating the body organs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> The cells increase, the cancer cells increase, and they take the place of the regular bodily cells, but they themselves are worthless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And the only idea they have for curing cancer is to cut out the diseased area from the body, remove that part of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kill it with X-ray.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yeah. They also try to bombard it with radiation, and that has its very bad effects. Their hair falls out. They get burns, sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Miserable condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Many modern sociologists, they are predicting that in twenty or thirty years the population will increase so much on this planet that the cities will be very, very crowded, and there will be many, many new problems: no room for so many cars and not enough food, not enough housing. They predict very, very.... And then the result will be rioting. So many people will not have enough food and good places to live that they will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you go back to home, back to Godhead? (laughs) We are trying to save them. Why you are rotting in this problem? (out of car) That reporter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> "No obstacle."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Death is not a problem."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are predicting so many problems, and still the rascals will say there is no problem. <span class="Italic">Padaṁ yad vipadām.</span> The material world is so made that in every step there is problems. [break] ...<span class="Italic">na teṣām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that as the population increases in the cities, there must be rioting and fighting. There will be so many people without the minimum necessities of life, so much exploitation of the rich upper class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not go to New Vrindaban? That they will not do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is no training how to live in New Vrindaban. They are educated only to live in the cities and work like <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> Even now.... One of the biggest problems that they're predicting is unemployment. They cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In America it has begun, what to speak of other countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Worse in other countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Today there are many articles in the papers that college students graduate and cannot find any jobs, so their degree is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This.... This was the problem in India, and now it is also in America. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> Graduating with Ph.D.'s and then becoming truck drivers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda said years ago that our colleges are producing beggars. They get a degree and then they beg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śūdras</span> and beggar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] ...reporter that he was liberated. Later on, he was asking whether you were joking. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Duryodhana-guru:</span> [break] It says in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam: āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this refers to someone who has attained Brahman realization, that he must fall down because he does not take shelter at Kṛṣṇa's lotus feet. Does this also refer to someone who has attained <span class="Italic">paramātmā</span> realization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless one reaches Vaikuṇṭha planet, nobody is safe. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...to the reporter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> What did he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He said that's all right, because the fish are happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And why did you not say that "I'll eat you"? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We told him it would take him one million years to get human birth again, and he was shocked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> [break] ...say that when the unemployment problem becomes very great, it will cause the government to start wars with other countries just to engage the men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where the government will get money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> They'll print it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagannātha-sūta:</span> ...cutting off the head when you have a headache.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...in the age of <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga,</span> difficulties will increase. That's a fact. Very, very difficult. We have passed only five thousand years, and there is balance of 427,000, hundreds of years, thousands. [break] ...only go back to home, back to Godhead. [break] ...has therefore advised that "Don't be engaged in all this nonsense activities, economic development. Simply become Kṛṣṇa conscious." [break] ...promises that "For such persons who are in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I'll take charge for their maintenance directly." <span class="Italic">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...envious of one another. They see that "These people, they do not do anything, and living so comfortably."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say that in the future, because of the overpopulation problem, there will not be sufficient foodstuffs, so they will have to develop eating simply by taking pills.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientists will do that, but we shall take milk preparations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We will drink milk, and they can drink their urine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> ...scientist, Buckminster Fuller, who doesn't agree with the other scientists. He says that with proper organization the entire population of the planet could live in California.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> ...density that we already have some population like in China and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Los Angeles we find so many houses: "Now Renting." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They told us in school that in India there are so many people, practically you cannot even move. But when we go to India we see there is miles and miles of empty land, simply a few cities where it's crowded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cities are crowded. Village? Very nice. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nalinīkaṇṭha:</span> ...there were so many people just in India that Mahārāja Ugrasena had ten quadrillion bodyguards alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At that time the India was whole planet. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> ...the body moves because of the presence of the soul. The scientists say that the body moves due to electronic impulses from the brain that cause the muscles to contract.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, why don't you produce it? Why you talk nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> I can't produce. It has happened by evolution over many millions of years. I don't have that long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you are dreaming? Do it practically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> We are not saying that we can do it. We are just explaining it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cares for your explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> We have so many followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> One day we will do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There is one famous movie or a book called <span class="Italic">Frankenstein,</span> and in that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> [break] ...correction house, they go and they spend their term, and they come out and they again commit a crime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Again and again chewing the chewed. <span class="Italic">Durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ, andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Prisoners, they spend so much of their life in the prisonhouse that when they are given an opportunity to leave, they refuse. (Prabhupāda laughs) They say, "No, I'm so accustomed to stay here, I'd rather just stay in prison." So they beg the governor to let them stay in prison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he comes out, he faces unemployment. Better to remain here. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...how to prolong life and stop death. So Dr. Frog has a recent theory that (Prabhupāda laughs) if a person fasts on every third day, he can prolong his life, twice as long. They are experimenting with rats on this basis. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And we take our knowledge from Śrīla Vyāsadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> And here also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the ocean, they're surfing, extreme cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> It's so cold that they sit on the water and they just tremble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also another punishment, voluntary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everybody's doing <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> but for their own cause.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes. <span class="Italic">Ugra-karma,</span> ferocious activities. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> ...people also do that. They wake up at two or three in the morning and drive and stand in the water for eight or ten hours, just freezing, waiting to catch a fish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> For sport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Just for fun, not even for eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> There are some fishermen that spend six months out of the year far out at sea just fishing. They sleep only three or four hours a day. They don't see any other people. They just live together on a big boat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> So the only way to beat that cycle is <span class="Italic">ajñāta-sukṛti</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why <span class="Italic">ajñāta</span>? Why not <span class="Italic">jñāta</span>? You rascal, you take Kṛṣṇa conscious. Why <span class="Italic">ajñāta</span>? Be informed. This is the only way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> He can take it directly without having performed some pious activities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll take.... No, if he accepts, that is pious. And Kṛṣṇa comes personally to canvass, "You rascal, take this and be happy." But he'll not do. Although it takes millions of years to come to that understanding, Kṛṣṇa personally comes: "You take it. I assure you, I shall give you all protection," but they'll not take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bharadvāja:</span> To everyone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When He comes here, He comes for everyone. When He teaches <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> is it for Arjuna? Everyone. [break] ...play is not distinct in the record.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kṛṣṇa-kānti:</span> Not distinct enough? I can make it louder.</div>
