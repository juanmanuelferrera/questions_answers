<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa will also increase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> The ability to remember Kṛṣṇa, that will also increase?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, if the brain is clear-it is not filled up with rubbish cow dung-then Kṛṣṇa consciousness easy. Yes. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means there is no more material consciousness. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">. Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [Brs.</span><span class="calibre3"> </span>1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is required. In material existence we have got so many obligations, thoughts (indistinct), and so many things. <span class="Italic">Bṛthā. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">eta saba chāḍi' āra varṇāśrama-dharma<br class="calibre2"/>akiñcana hañā laya kṛṣṇaika-śaraṇa</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Sarva-dharmān: Everything give up. That is India's Vedic civilization. They are not concerned with the material advancement. Simple life. That's all. And our present leaders, they are thinking that "brainwashed." They are not deeply thinking, "Why our great sages and <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> recommended this life, not the skyscraper life? Why? They were not less intelligent." They are not thinking in that way. They are thinking that "Because we neglected the skyscraper thoughts, we are so backward." At least this rascal Nehru was thinking like that. "So finish this." The Russia is... What is called? Opiate, brainwashed. These things are accepted like that. "It has no value, simply some prejudice and superstition, and they are thinking like that and they are spoiling their material side of life." This is their idea. "What is this? No meat-eating?" (knock on the door devotee enters with <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> ) That little <span class="Italic">dāl, daliya,(?) bas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Nothing else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pālikā:</span> Nothing else?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. If I take anything else it becomes overburdened. Better take little less, just to satisfy that I am not starving. (laughter) Better to starve. That is better. But we are habituated, so better give some consolance, "No, no, you are not starving." Otherwise starving is better. <span class="Italic">Nidrāhāra-vihārakādi-vijitau</span><i class="calibre3"> <span class="Italic"></span></i>**. (pause) So they were glad that I am coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh, yes. He was happy. And she was also happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Gosāi Mā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. No, she was very kind upon me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, they are very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How long is it since you've been to the Rādhā-Dāmodara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When did you last go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last? Maybe 1972.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> About four years. What about that Keśī-ghāṭa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I didn't have time to find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Whereabouts, exactly, is that place at Keśī-ghāṭa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. (chuckles) We can go some day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I think I met somebody from there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, his daughter came there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Daughter or granddaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Something like that, yes. He was talking about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I first came in Vṛndāvana I stayed in the Keśī-ghāṭa. That is very palatial building. My room was as big as this. Yes, as big. Plus one side room, plus one entrance room. I was paying fifteen rupees. And I could see whole Vṛndāvana, Yamunā, from the top my house. It is very nice, very palatial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's in the big building on the, right on the side of the <span class="Italic">ghāṭa</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which gate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's in the big building right on the side of Keśī-ghāṭa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is a big building, Bharat Maharaja, yes, Bharatpur, just by the side of that house. It is in the corner. The door is in the corner. The road is going this way in the corner. It is stone. Face is stone. Good building, but... [break] ...in thought of Kṛṣṇa, outside cleaning by oil and soap. Soap. <span class="Italic">Bāhyābhyantara-śuciḥ.</span> This is quite comfortable, not very chilly, within this room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, this retains the heat nicely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are so misled. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> We have to change this body. There is no preparation. "As sure as death." Death will take place, and you have to accept another body. Who understands this philosophy? Nobody. They are so dull-headed. This body finished, everything finished. All big, big leaders, scholars, they say. One gentleman, his name is... He was Rabindranath Tagore's brother, artist. So in a meeting he was saying, "We are so fool. Thinking of next life, next life, we are spoiling this life." He said like that long, long ago when we were children, young men, about eighteen years, twenty years. So I remember distinctly, he is saying in the meeting that "Simply thinking of next life, we are spoiling this life." He said. That was his explanation. So at that time we were young boys: "Yes, why we should think of, so much of next life?" Of course, I was not very much convinced, but naturally... I think his name Aurobindo Tagore, like that. Rabindranath Tagore. He is good artist. Artist means latest fashion, like this, like that, like that. He was considered to be latest artist. And his view is that. I talked with Professor Kotofsky. He said, "Swamiji, after finishing this body everything is finished." Communist. This is the cent per cent idea. The so-called scientists, they are thinking, by chemical evolution the body has come in existence. These things are discussed in B<span class="Italic">hagavad-gītā.</span> By accident, if it is a combination of chemicals, that means the bodily existence was not before. It has come in by accident, combination. "So why, Arjuna, you are lamenting for the body which was not in existence? And it will not exist after. Then why you are so much anxious for the middle portion?" Good reasoning. The body was not in existence. That is the general... And as soon as you finish, there is no more existence. So via media, between the manifestation and nonmanifestation, in the middle there is some manifesta... Why you are so much absorbed in that part? Therefore the Europeans, Americans, they bring in the charges, "brainwash." "A brainwash movement. It has no actual value. Simply an artificial way of pushing the idea in the brain. And they have to give up. These children are spoiled. They have given up meat-eating and illicit sex. Their life is spoiled, and so on, so on." So their theory is not without background. There is a background philosophy. And for Western countries, this is a completely new idea. Therefore they are charging, "brainwash." They are not to be blamed because they are, I mean to say, raised in that ideas. Hm? Is it not? Yes. "So this is simply brainwash movement. It has no factual standing." Even our country, what to speak of Western countries. Where the spiritual civilization has a strong background, they are also not believing. Nobody believes Kṛṣṇa is God. Even big, big leaders, what to speak of ordinary men. Especially the so-called educated men. "Bring money anyhow and enjoy life." <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> And for money they are doing everything. Black money, white money, yellow money, this money. (laughs) "Bring money and enjoy. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> This is life. Why this nonsense Kṛṣṇa consciousness? No this, no this, no this. Ninety-nine per cent no and one per cent yes. What is the value of this movement?" Is it not? Our life is ninety-nine per cent no. No air even. (laughter) So what to speak of other thing. It is very difficult. Therefore in the beginning I was hopeless, that "Who will hear this movement? Simply no." And especially in this country, in Europe. So dull brain. (end)</div>
