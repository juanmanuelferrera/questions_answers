<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...American,'' "I am Indian,'' "I am this,'' "I am that.'' Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Did you have some places to see down in, ah, for Prabhupāda to see in the next day or two?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There's this one big church I went to see in Hammersmith, and I thought he could see... (devotees conversing in background)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Himavatī?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2) (Haṁsadūta?):</span> She's... I think she's upstairs in the... (more devotee conversation in background)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There is one very large church to see on Monday.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Monday.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah. Not before.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not before?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well, we can arrange for this week also a church.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where it is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It's in Hammersmith, Hammersmith.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How far?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> From here its about five miles, four or five miles.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It's, ah, towards the airport.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Towards the airport. So not bad.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Not bad. No, it's still downtown.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It's on the motorway. It's very near to the motorway, the motorway coming from the airport into central London.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not see earlier? Have you got any description?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well, we can't see it earlier because it belongs to the Methodist Church, and their committee members are meeting in another city, in Manchester, for a week. They have their..., a big congress meeting there. So they don't come back until the end of this week.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So we can't see it while they're meeting?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well we could see it from the outside. Actually we went there one day, Mr. Allen(?) and (indistinct) and myself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, what is the description?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> It's very nice. It's something like, ah, something like the size of this temple but bigger.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Bigger than Los Angeles?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> And also it has a steeple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bigger, bigger. What is the price?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Oh, more than 250,000 pounds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Quarter of a million pounds. Two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of pounds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> So that's six million dollars?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> No, one million. One million dollars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, it's not a million dollars. It's only 600,000.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well they said between 250,000 and 350,000 pounds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Oh, the money, the money won't be as important as the place. If we get the place, we can get the money, I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But still there is a congregation. It's not available immediately.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> There's a congregation there still.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (Revatīnandana?):</span> You have no idea when it would be available?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Tomorrow I will go out, some of the others will go out, we'll find some places to look at for you. I have some friends, we'll all go see them.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what do you think of this Dr. Sar? As he speaks, it is all right, do you think? Does he speak more than what he is?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is he trustworthy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, he speaks more than what he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (Revatīnandana?):</span> Yes. I, I, I don't like him very much. I, I don't know what his motive is, you know. I don't think his motive is strictly very much..., you know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He approached me and he said... I was talking about life members to him, saying, "Why shouldn't it be one hundred pounds? This is a good price for life members.'' And he said, "Well, fifty-one pounds, this is the value of one hundred(?) rupees.'' He said, "I am prepared to give fifty-one pounds.'' Then he said, "Actually, I have given already more than than fifty-one pounds. I have given Kṛṣṇa's jewelry, so why you don't make me life member?'' And I said, "But you have not asked.'' And he said, "But I have given at least..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Make him life member. He's given all the jewelry.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is he a very influential man?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> What's the definition of influential man?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or he's not very... He talks?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He talks a bit about his community, but he's not produced anything for this community. He's produced some money for the jewelry. This is very nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Personal money. Personal money?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Not just personal money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think he can help us by raising funds?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He can help, but I don't think he can raise thousands and thousands and thousands. See, personally he has no money. He told me he has no money. He's simply at his job he gets so much money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he's working somewhere?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, he's working. He's in Oxford Street, very near.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he says that he's M.A., Ph.D.? You see? So? He says so.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, he's a graduate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He's a doctorate, Ph.D.?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But still not so influential.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither you are. Is he reliable?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Well, he's said so many times, "I can help, I can help.'' But still he's not produced anything positive.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This carpet was donated by him?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yes, this rug.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This? This has been here for years. In the beginning he did, I guess. Mukunda would know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can ask Nanda Kumāra to give me milk in that way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you can ask Himavatī. What is your formula?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (Revatīnandana):</span> Ginger powder and a little bit of saffron and sugar. Heat it up for a while, and then after a little while mix thoroughly and serve like that. It's good for digestion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You give to Nanda Kumāra, because he will give.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (converses in Hindi with Indian about traveling <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> party in Birmingham, Cardiff)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> She was very happy, Sumati Morarji.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> She went away very happy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will be happy when you are Kṛṣṇa's devotee. You see? She's seeing Kṛṣṇa's so many devotees. That is Kṛṣṇa <i class="calibre3">bhakta.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> She said she wanted to see the Deities before leaving.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And she saw?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Two months ago she came here for most of the <i class="calibre3">aratik</i> ceremony. The devotees came out to say goodbye to her, and she said, "Go back and do <i class="calibre3">aratik.</i>"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She can influence the whole Bombay, she's so...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Oh, she knows everyone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We need a president like her for the board of trustees for London also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Has she had any assistance?(?)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. She is doing her best. She is nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> When is Mr. (indistinct) going to come?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He's going to drive Prabhupāda to Kensington tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Or Friday.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He can't come before? He should come...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He comes almost every night actually. (more conversation)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the Joshi is the manager here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> That's her manager here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Oh, then he's the one who should know everything. She said she would carry everything for us practically around the world...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...on her boats. We have many <i class="calibre3">mṛdaṅgas</i>, everything...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. In Calcutta. From Calcutta, there she starts for all over the world. So simply... But Calcutta manager is rascal. Calcutta manager, that is difficult.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Why don't we send... Why don't we send a hundred, two hundred <i class="calibre3">mṛdaṅgas</i> to America and Europe, big shipments sometime? We really use them down through the years.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I know that Calcutta manager is a (Hindi). (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, they won't become... They have many... All the big men in the Calcutta house, they won't become life members. None of them. I know, I approached them. No one will become life members.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta house?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That Calcutta Scindia office. There's several big men. The one I remember is Mr. Trivedi. I don't know if he's the head man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Trivedi.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah. I talked to him, but he will not become a life member. He wouldn't even give that much rupees. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not very highly paid. Within thousand. In Japan also. The high salary is in your country.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unexpected fabulous(?) Just like that boy who came to see me yesterday. He's in India, he's getting 900 dollars, that means our ten thousand rupees. Gopal is also not getting. I asked Gopal to continue his service and give 400 dollars per month.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Hm. Each month. That's great. Very good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So here we shall give you books, cost price only, and you sell books by profit only and spend for building.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Traveling Saṅkīrtana Party is very strong here. There's some very nice boys now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They go out and they simply distribute, and just like I think in San Francisco, Keśava's... He began it here. They just go out with literature and simply to distribute literature, you know, in that way.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Keśava's feeling not well, then he can come here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He wanted to. He wanted to bring his party here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can do that. Let him do that. Write him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But actually he may improve it even more. They are already a good group. They are doing all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very expert. Not only good, very expert.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> They're averaging sixty-seventy pounds a day.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Sixty-seventy pounds a day they're collecting.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not collecting so much?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> What's that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not collecting so much?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Here in the temple?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> We are collecting, on Oxford Street, we're collecting about forty, fifty pounds a day, and on travelling <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i>, sixty, seventy pounds, because they're doing it for more hours. So altogether we're over a hundred pounds a day.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you are GBC here, you have come, now you make it hundred pounds daily. How to do it, he knows.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But, but there is already hundred pounds coming. Two hundred pounds, then.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And his best friend is George. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm going to see him tomorrow.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Is he in town?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can alone make purchase a good temple. George alone can purchase.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He says George is in New York.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (conversation in background)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Oh, he may be with Mr. Ravi Patel. I think we saw him at the airport.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He's a printer, and he came in the van with you from the airport. He's a very nice man. He's doing printing for us. He says he has so many thousands of rupees in Bombay and in Madras from his printing. And he also wants to offer his services. I think he will come tomorrow to see you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can print our books, in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He said he wanted to offer his services here for this temple somehow or other by getting money from advertising purposes. He's the director of some company that's just been started. It's called Golden Products. They make all kinds of consumer goods like shampoos and soap powders, so many things like that, for household use. And he wanted to use his symbol, Golden Products, with this society. This is his idea.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Golden powder?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Golden Products.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our society? No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> I told him...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> He went to the (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was a boy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> His other idea is, he said he was working for Sai Baba, Satya Sai Baba. He said that in India he had raised so many thousands of <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of rupees by making posters. They are impersonal posters, so much nonsense in them, but they sold like lottery tickets. In this way he printed them and made so much money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean he cannot suggest. We cannot accept anyone's suggestion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's proven to be too..., too horrible.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, always.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I saw Mr.... Who was that? What's that man's name who made your first record in New York?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Collin.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Ah, I saw Mr. Collin at the airport when you arrived in New York at that meeting, press meeting.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he was there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He was there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, why did he not see me?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He didn't come. He was a little embarrassed, I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He must be embarrassed. He's a thief. (laughter) Desirous man never becomes happy. He did not pay me anything as royalty for the record.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's still selling it, too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He's still selling that record.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Must be selling and taking advantage of this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's a nice record.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is that <i class="calibre3">Govinda?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> That's a very nice record. Everyone is appreciating.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I heard that rascal always played my record and hear Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> At least he's benefiting somehow. I saw him in Bombay also one day in the market of Madhubal, Madhubhag(?) temple? He was buying beads for his store in New York.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's selling beads, records, on our account. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He was being cheated himself, in Bombay. He was being cheated like anything. He was paying one rupee for one strand of beads, those poor quality beads. (pause)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you can arrange for the car?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. Ātreya Ṛṣi is going to be working on it, too, to raise funds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, at least two first-class car must go to India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Cadillac?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any. They must recognize, "Here the American guru is going."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Have to get Cadillac.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughter) If the American guru has no car, he's walking on the street, that is disgrace for you. Is it not? (laughs) And they criticize, "Oh, what kind of guru you are, you are walking on the street? You are American guru?"</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I was thinking if each devotee in the United States went out...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You write on the car, "The Spiritual Master of USA.'' (laughter) And people will see, "Oh, here is the spiritual...'' (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Should we do that? "Spiritual Master of USA"?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> If each of your devotees collected five dollars one day, that's $5,000, more, more than $5,000.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you... And soon as you issue letter, that will come. It is not my (indistinct) And she will carry. Make arrangement with government so that next time when I go to India, I sit on the car. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And Gurudasa... Actually we better do it soon, because it takes two or three months.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so you can do.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We can talk about the details later.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am immigrant here; I've stayed since 1965. The embassy, everyone, knows. So I can take my cars, that there is a law. So in this way take permission from the government and you get the car and I go and drive it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You'll take this car with you, Prabhupāda, wherever you go?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You will take this car with you wherever you go?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As far as possible. People will see, "The spiritual master of USA is going there."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Supposing you want to go to Bombay. You can fly to Bombay and someone can drive the car there. And then when you're in Bombay, you can drive it in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can go from Calcutta to Agra, nice road. And from Agra to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How many days? Two days?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. One day, two days, yes. Even if it runs fifty mile per hour, so from morning, early morning to noon, say six hours if we run, it's three hundred miles in the morning and three hundred miles in the evening, and stay at night. And then the next day three hundred miles, three hundred..., six hundred miles. Twelve hundred miles anywhere you go from Calcutta to Bombay, Calcutta to Madras, Calcutta to Delhi, within twelve hundred miles. Within two days from anywhere to anywhere you can go. India's length and breadth is not so wide as in your country. You have got... That is also not good roads, in your... But in Calcutta, to Calcutta-Bombay, Madras, Delhi, there are good roads.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good roads. So we can go by road.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we can begin campaigning right away, collecting funds for the vehicle.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you are a good driver. (laughter) Eighty miles. You once at eighty miles, his father's car. His father gave a very nice car for my driving. His father, mother, sister met me in Portland. Very nice gentleman, mother nice, sister very beautiful.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But silent.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I have written to her some letters, but silence.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. They are not very happy that you are in this movement, not in the family, naturally. They think, "Our lost child.'' (laughter) They cannot appreciate that "My child is lost for better purposes.'' That is the case.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Actually, I wanted to ask you about something like that. When I took <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i> in Calcutta, some time afterwards, I used to correspond with my parents. So I sent them a letter explaining what was <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>, and that I had taken <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>, and that I didn't want to hear so much more about nieces, nephews, things like that that I have in that family. I said "If you want to talk, now we have to talk about Kṛṣṇa consciousness.'' So I didn't hear anything from them for about six months. But just the other day I received a letter...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then don't. Now you have taken <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>, you don't.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I shouldn't do it at all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But she's quite intelligent. She's asking...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your mother?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah. ...all about Kṛṣṇa consciousness. She has the <i class="calibre3">Gītā.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your mother, your mother must be intelligent because you are intelligent. Your mother must be intelligent. Without mother being intelligent, no intelligent son comes out. A son inherits the quality of mother, and the daughter inherits the quality of father. This is natural.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The letter is so... She's told me, she says, "Two reasons I want to hear from you: one, I want to know how you are,'' that's the body. She says also, "I'm interested in this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement,'' because she's noticed that the devotees...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is mother's anxiety. You see all this?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So I should not respond?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, you can send news: "Mother, I'm all right.'' That's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's all right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Don't worry. No. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also was sending news to His mother.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Although He never went to mother.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's hard for the family, because my mother's brother is Viṣṇujana Mahārāja's father, right? So they also figure they have lost one son. They don't hear from him at all, and now she doesn't hear from me at all. So the whole family is very miserable. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. But they have lost for the better.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes, but they don't understand that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lost not in vain. They will be benefited. They will be benefited. You are giving the best service to the family. What about your mother, Himavatī?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Himavatī:</span> I never hear from her anymore.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Himavatī:</span> I never hear from her anymore.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She's also not very happy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Himavatī:</span> No. I don't think she's very happy with me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. Anyway, you serve Kṛṣṇa and then your mother will be best served. Kṛṣṇa will favor all the family members of a devotee. You have seen from Prahlāda Maharaja's statement. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that anyone coming to become His devotee, He takes care of the family of the devotee-spiritually, for their emancipation. That is natural. Just like government. If somebody dies on the warfield, the government takes care of the whole family. Similarly, if the government has so much sense, do you mean to say Kṛṣṇa is nonsense? He also takes care of the family of the devotee. <i class="calibre3">Yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 9.22]. Where is Nanda Kumāra, Pradyumna?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pradyumna's been studying all day. Ah... Nanda Kumāra may be..., is he there in the room?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I don't want(?). Maybe sleeping?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He is tired.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very tired. What was it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pradyumna didn't take rest last night, I don't think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pradyumna... Nanda Kumāra was sleeping.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Charlie Chaplin kept us up all night.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Charlie Chaplin kept us up all night. (laughs) Charlie Chaplin show.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That was nice. (laughter) He is really funny man. (laughs) He has got originality. All his comic play has got some originality, that is the beauty. How he invented! (laughs) I think that character, when he was a drunkard, he was a great friend, (laughs) and when he's not drunkard, "Who is this man?'' (laughs) He's grave(?) as rich man. And as drunkard, "You pay. You are my friend, life-long friend. Whatever you want, you take.'' (laughs) So these characters he's painting, it's very good intelligence. And he made him friend when he was going to commit suicide.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yeah, he stopped him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He stopped him. Accidentally he stopped. (laughs) Not willingly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes. He tried to pull him up from the water, he went in himself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very nice, funny man with intelligence. And before him there was another, Mr. Max Linder.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Max Linder.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was also very funny Englishman. In our childhood we used to enjoy their play, Max Linder and Chaplin, or Charlie Chaplin.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They were showing them in India?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uh? Yes. Max Linder, I remember, he was sitting in a park. (laughter) You know that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I don't know anything about it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was sitting in a park, so that English dress, that tail coat? What is called?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Coattails, yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the tail was hanging, so some naughty boys, they fixed up nails, you see? So when he got up, the whole tail gone, you see? But he could not understand. He went to the ball dance. So he's dancing, so everyone's seeing his tail, in this way. So he thought, "Oh, what is the matter?'' He went to the mirror and he saw, "Oh, my tail is lost.'' (laughs) Then he came again in the ball dance and he was pushing everyone, just to show. And everyone was asking, "What is this? What is this?'' "Oh, you do not know? This is latest fashion. This is latest fashion.'' Then all of them cut the tails. I think he had taken the idea, (Sanskrit). This is Sanskrit story, that (Sanskrit), or monkey, he lost his tail, and he began to advertise, "This is the latest fashion.'' So that ball-dancing without tail, that was, I remember, it is very enjoyable. They say that Charlie Chaplin is the student of Max Linder. He learned this funny play from Max Linder. So I knew Charlie Chaplin is an Englishman.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, he is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is Englishman.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He went to America and then he made all these films.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He went to America and he made a lot of money there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> As far as I know, Prabhupāda, he was Jew, but he used to live in east of London, or south of London. There is an autobiography about it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Max Linder, ah, Charlie Chaplin? Yes. He was a London man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But that movie was filmed in Los Angeles, the one we saw last night. In Hollywood. All the palm trees and the (indistinct) behind.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Indian (Ksirodaksayi?):</span> One of the elder sons, he's still living in Hampstead Heath.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, his eldest son. And where he is, Charlie Chaplin?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In America.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's in Switzerland.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> No, no, he lives in Europe somewhere. Switzerland, most... Sometimes coming in Hampstead Heath.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has got a big family?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You said that he's producing a still child?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, he produced last year, or two years ago. It was in <i class="calibre3">Life</i> magazine.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (pause)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's already about 10:30.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> All glories to Śrīla Prabhupāda. (devotees leave)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So ask Pradyumna if he wants to give.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<i class="calibre3">viṣaya chāḍiyā</i>. Oh, yes, then it is (indistinct). <i class="calibre3">Viṣaya chāḍiyā</i>, <i class="calibre3">se rase majiyā mukhe bolo hari hari</i>, <i class="calibre3">parama karuṇa, pahū dui jana</i>. But even if we do speculation business and do it for Kṛṣṇa, that is not good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Not so high a class.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are doing little business because <i class="calibre3">gṛhasthas</i>, they require money. All right, do some incense, this, that. Not very big business. If one is expert like Arjuna or Ambarīṣa Mahārāja, that is different thing. Just like this Advaita, he was given in press. Now he sees that "I can work anywhere I want, so I can get money. Why I should waste my time?'' He neglected. That means <i class="calibre3">viṣaya</i> attracted him. He thought, "I am qualified boy. Why I should waste my time with this press?'' Therefore he went away. He sacrificed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and now he's getting some money he's satisfied. He's thinking that he has become a big man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Ātreya Ṛṣi went to see them in New York the last day, but they wouldn't come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Both, (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are getting money from other <i class="calibre3">karmīs</i>, so why they should come? They are thinking that "As family man we must make money.'' <i class="calibre3">Ato gṛha-kṣetra-sutāpta-vittair </i>, huh? House, land, children, friends, money for increasing their illusion. <i class="calibre3">Janasya moho 'yam ahaṁ mameti<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 5.5.8]. (indistinct) He does not know that he is being finished, and he's thinking that "I am making profit.'' <i class="calibre3">Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāta</i>. This rascal, he's being defeated. He does not know. He got the chance of Kṛṣṇa consciousness; he sacrificed Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And he is attracted by little pounds, dollars. (pause) But his wife is good, Balai dāsī. She is coming.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, she came to <i class="calibre3">maṅgala-ārati.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She comes, and she said, "Then we live separately, Advaita.'' He doesn't like. He's such a rascal. Such a nice, good, beautiful wife, and he's neglecting. (sounds of Prabhupāda taking <i class="calibre3">prasādam</i>) Milk, here they take cold milk, and they (makes sounds of <i class="calibre3">glug-glug-glug</i> drinking). No. Milk should be hot, and it should be taken little.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the way of taking milk. And this <i class="calibre3">masala</i>, it does not taste good. In India, especially in Northern India, Punjab, they will take at night, milk, (indistinct). No other things. They, all business men, the Marwari society, they'll take food before evening and then again they work. Then after ten they will come home and take little milk and go rest. (pause) So foundation committee is being established in Bombay making her the president of the trust. Then Giriraja will have no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They'll contribute. And if she canvasses, she can collect <i class="calibre3">lakhs.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But one thing is, if Giriraja takes advantage and begins preaching in her school daily... She's invited him, open invitation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then it will be pleased.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then when she'll see her students improve, then she'll give us all help.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now we have got land, many people will contribute materials. Materials, we can get materials from many big, big merchants.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, like, ah, Tarachand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cement, iron, they will.. "All right. Give it.'' Goods, anyone will give.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tarachand Gupta, I think his name is.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is also our life member. He is nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Iron merchant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wanted to invite me one day. He met me on the park. Do you remember?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I remember.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's one of the richest men.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. I think when you go back there the next year, or next autumn...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now we have created some impression that we are doing something nice. Even Keating is also impressed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. We're not wandering from village to village anymore. We're settled.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Even we wander from village to village, people are being impressed that we are doing something good. Actually it is so. I tell you it is so. One who cannot understand it, he is a fool. Actually we are doing the best work, God consciousness. And actually it is a fact: simply for want of God consciousness they are suffering, that's all. There is no other reason. The only reason is this. Just like this morning I said, "God is the proprietor. Why you are claiming proprietor? You may be manager, not proprietor.'' Actually that is our position. Just like I am head of this institution, but I am not dealing as proprietor. I am dealing as manager, head. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This is the only society where Kṛṣṇa is the owner of everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And all my assistants, they are also working in that capacity. If I would have been proprietor, then they would not have been interested.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I would have collected the money and used for my sense gratification. Then nobody would help me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think the English milk is better than American milk, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think so. It is from Holland.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh. There's some famous islands between England and Holland called the Jersey Islands. There's special milk that comes from Jersey. Jersey milk is best.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. These Europeans, Americans, if they take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they'll be more happy. That is assured. From all angles of vision-their family life, their political life, their social life, their cultural life, their religious life, their philosophical life, their scientific life-everything will be perfect. Now you have to teach them. I can give you the ideas how they'll be happy. The rascals, they do not know why, what is your specialness, and just to teach you this. My only ambition is that you are... (aside:) Oh, there is no water. You are supposed to be the most intelligent persons. (Prabhupāda drinks) So if you take, others will take. That is going on. So I have no distinction between East and West. They're thinking that East is conquering West by culture. That is their enviousness. (laughter) That is, they are afraid. Because the Britishers, they kept Indian culture suppressed so long because... [break] ...the <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya</i>, kings, in special cases. Not for public. Among the <i class="calibre3">kṣatriyas</i>. And among the <i class="calibre3">vaiśyas</i>, one day in a year, when they were allocated(?), to try one's luck. One day they'll bet. Not amongst the <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i> or the <i class="calibre3">śūdras</i>. <i class="calibre3">Śūdras</i> have no money to gamble, and <i class="calibre3">brāhmaṇas</i> prohibited. The <i class="calibre3">kṣatriyas</i>, they were also allowed in special cases, and the <i class="calibre3">vaiśyas</i> were allowed to engage in gambling one day in a year. That means restricted.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Boy, that system of <i class="calibre3">dharma..</i>. We can start discussing it tomorrow in our philosophy class. It's just so perfect. Everything is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Whole plan is perfect.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But the British systematically broke it down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Lord Macauley(?) gave them in this study, they said that if you keep the Indians in their original culture, then they cannot be broken. Gandhi took that state: noncooperation. Don't cooperate with them. And then kill them. <b class="calibre4">Devotee:</b> This man who wrote this book made an interesting comment. He said that after..., or before the First World War, when the British were entering the First World War, they made a promise to the Indians that "If you help us fight this war, then we will give you freedom afterwards."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They helped, but they didn't give them freedom. So Gandhi or the others, they took that <i class="calibre3">asat</i>. "They have broken their promise, so now we can break ours, noncooperation."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They actually expanded their empire all over the (indistinct) world by Indian cooperation. Therefore these big men like Attlee, when they thought that "India is going out of our hands,'' so don't (indistinct) up our empire. Forget it. They voluntarily (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The whole thing. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now they are not, those Englishmen, as they were in Victorian day. Nobody cares for you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You'll see the last remnants at that Commonwealth Club, I think, engagement. No more, no one cares.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Commonwealth is in name. (pause)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Still, there is something about London. Everyone likes to come here. There's so many... There's not enough hotel rooms even.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's not even enough hotel rooms to accommodate so many tourists who come here to London.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> London is still famous. People outside, they have got very high idea about London.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Civilized. Very civilized city.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why civilized? Do you think it is especially civilized?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, a lot more than America anyway. By comparison it seems civilized, in the sense that there is not so much violence. There's not... People are honest, upright, moral, a little more.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In America general life is becoming wretched.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Wretched. Police don't even carry guns here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Policemen don't even carry guns in Britain, but in America every policeman's got at least one gun.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Englishman... I've studied Englishman. They consider America is still uncivilized. They say like that. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Still uncivilized, yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But here also hippy-ism growing.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They've lost that old aristocracy civilization. Losing it fast.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So write Girirāja immediately a letter, that she agreed to be president of the trust. You make a trust body for fund-raising, and our best life members, like Sumati Morarji, and make her the president of the trust. You remain the secretary, and other also, as treasurer also. One or two of her own men.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Just a small number. Not a big trust.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. In this way you raise funds.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Meanwhile, he should start utilizing her invitation to teach in the schools sometimes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and she'll cooperate. And write letter for permission for carrying our motorcar and incense.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, and inform Gurudāsa...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has already agreed, that, ah, what is called? Punks? The punks sent to Calcutta, and from there then send to Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. I'm wondering why they can't take them directly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Directly not very many ships come to Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, from Hong Kong that way, that direction, they don't come. They come on their way back. I see. Yeah, they take Chinese goods from Hong Kong to India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They take Chinese goods from Hong Kong to India.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's not many from Hong Kong to America.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore she said send to India. Take information.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Transfer to another boat. That will save them a thousand dollars a month.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. That's a thousand dollar contribution.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. And as it grows, it will increase.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And send them a Gujarati paper, our magazine, distribution amongst their workers. That will satisfy (indistinct) sense.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hm. Tell that to Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hundred, two hundred magazines.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not hundred. Say fifty, for distribution amongst his officers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that everyone will be satisfied.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think Ksirodakasayi has the information on that car business. Because he once inquired and got papers. He may have them here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So make arrangement. At least two cars, nice cars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One car and one van?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One car and one van?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Van? What is the use of van?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, they can carry many people, that's the thing, like a <i class="calibre3">saṅkīrtana</i> party.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Saṅkīrtana</i> may be six men. They can go in car.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (laughs) Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And better for carrying our luggage, add to the car some small...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Trailer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...trailer, yes, two wheel. Oh, it will go.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The advantage of the van is that they can sleep in it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The advantage of a van is that it can be used for sleeping purposes also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sleeping purposes in India, tropical country, if you carry camp, if you want to sleep somewhere you just immediately set up a camp and pass night very comfortable. And you go on the field passing stool. Just catch up some watery place. (laughter) You can cook, you can take bath, you can wash your dishes, then put up on the trailer and go on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Mostly we'll be going to big...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'll agree if you can send one van also, two cars and one van.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Mostly we'll be going to bigger cities anyway. The roads between big cities are all right. But if we go places...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Work sincerely and everything will be supplied by Kṛṣṇa. Now take... (end)</div>
