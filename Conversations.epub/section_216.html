<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> ...name of the Lord is identical with the Lord Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that great rascal says that Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the chief of the tribe that lived in Central India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, and he's passing on as a great scholar, such a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He had 10,000 ah, subjects. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Lord Caitanya, all of them become nullified and this rascal comes forward to defy all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> and push some new theory. Just see. This is going on. (Sanskrit) In the <span class="Italic">Varāha Purāṇa</span> it is stated that some of the <span class="Italic">rākṣasas,</span> they will take advantage of Kali-yuga and take birth in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> families, so he is one of them, this <span class="Italic">rākṣasa.</span> And now he is suffering for that. Greatest calamity, you see? And according to Vedic injunction, the king if he levies tax from the subjects who are sinful, then he has to partake of the sinful action and he'll have to suffer. So, this rascal became the president of India, it is the position of king and on the (indistinct) of him he supported the slaughterhouses and levied taxes and he took high salary, enjoyed it. Now he is suffering the effect, sinful effect. Now in his living condition he has lost his brain. He, practically dead but living condition, it is very precarious condition. One is living actually but his brain is not acting, worse than a madman. So, this is the result of the <span class="Italic">rākṣasa</span> statement. Yes, go on. (end)</div>
