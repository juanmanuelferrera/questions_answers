<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...you have seen today, that is worth two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of dollars. In two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of dollars you can have a palace in Iraq(??).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, not palace...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> here... You have to have all two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> completely in your hand before you can step into this house. All there with two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i>, you step into the house, a palace or (indistinct) house.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our Los Angeles temple, what we paid? Dayānanda, you know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> It was 225, I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, 225, hundred thousand.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> $225,000.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Two hundred and twenty-five thousand. That must be a gorgeous place. Beautiful, beautiful, huge.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Name must appear very large.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And what was the down payment for that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I paid 50,000.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Fifty thousand. Here the down payment means the total payment. You have to pay everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> And land is so small. Must be very small. Land is only two hundred and... (everyone talking at once)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But we expect that in one or two years' time the prices of land will come back to normal, or at least there will be some place available out of town at a reasonable price. When that happens, I think...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> I don't think that will happen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (general discussion about land purchasing) But now, you know, people are taking advantage. The one who is selling now, he is going to America. He says, "Let me pack this two <i class="calibre3">lakhs</i> of dollars and go and buy in America.'' Why should (indistinct)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So American immigration?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, he must have taken immigration. Then he is going to America. His son or daughter must be there. All Iranians have daughters and sons in America or Europe. So...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Reason is because from the last fifty years the education was a big problem here, and the government needed people to get educated. So they gave a lot of facilities that people should send their children out to get educated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foreign education.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. So everybody who could have some money or he could afford it, he sends his children to America, London, Paris, Germany. Very huge (indistinct). But they are full in Germany, they are full in London, they are full in America. They are four places where everybody... In London you can walk everywhere on the street and you can hear...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (to other guest) Oh, you are going? Thank you very much. (Bengali) (long pause)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The idea is that if you work hard and try to please Kṛṣṇa, then you'll get a temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda arrived in New York with only... Eight dollars? How many dollars you had when you arrived in New York?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seven dollars. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Seven dollars.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> But I think you got that from selling the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatams.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That extra. We brought from India seven dollars. At that time the exchange was four rupees, eight annas. And you were not allowed to take more than forty rupees. That is same now. So I wanted to sell one set of books to the captain, Mr. Pandia. So he gave me twenty dollars in exchange, three books. I was confident Kṛṣṇa was there, (indistinct) seven dollars. (Hindi)... [break] ...strongly by chance?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do they support? In other words, they cannot give explanation, and like a foolish man says "Chance.'' You cannot give proper explanation how things are happening. Like a foolish rascal: "Chance.''</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Because they see according to their intelligence that things are happening according to chance. According to their understanding, sometimes things happen...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is this understanding? The chance?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> In their experience, or in our experience, we see things are happening...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is the use of the scientists? Things take place by chance. What is the use of them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> By chance there may be an accident, or by chance there may be...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, things will happen by chance, accident. So why they're bothering about things and taking the credit of becoming scientist?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> It's not completely chance. There are certain laws which they try to find, which act whenever these elements...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in other words, that they are not yet conversant with the things, and still they are claiming to be scientist. They do not know thoroughly how things are happening, and still they are taking the credit of becoming scientist.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> They have developed a branch of mathematics that deals with chance, things happening with chance.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that mathematics department is now being closed. You know that? Nobody cares to attend that mathematic meeting. People are becoming disinterested with these chance theories. There is one Dr. Henderson, you know? He became doctor in that field. He's not getting job, now he's manufacturing incense.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Oh, George Henderson?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> George Henderson. He has no job here. All these theoretical doctors are no longer required by (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I was reading the other day that they are doing some experiments on Mars. They have twenty-two different theories about this one idea. Just this one little idea, twenty-two different theories.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Theory means they are not certain.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The misfortunate thing is that people in general have faith in the scientists.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have to create people to have faith in Kṛṣṇa. If people are going by faith, so you have to create this faith that Kṛṣṇa (indistinct). They can create, you can create. And they criticize our destiny theory, believing in the destiny. They criticize it. So why they'll depend on chance theory? What is the difference, destiny and chance?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Destiny means there is controller.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Destiny means there is a controller.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but they cannot explain what is this controller; therefore they disbelieve. Just like yesterday we were discussing that atheist class, that they are by chance there was lusty desires and there was pregnancy and there will be child. So we say, "No. <i class="calibre3">Daiva-netreṇa</i>. These things have been arranged by superior authorities.'' This is destiny, that what is already arranged by superior authority, that is destiny. You cannot change it. A man is ordered to be hanged by court justice, you cannot change. He is to be hanged. And they will say, "By chance he will be hanged."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Sometimes something happens to interfere with that. He gets a reprieve from the governor, or the rope breaks, and they only hang him once.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing, but first thing is that if one is ordered to be hanged, he has to be hanged. Destined. But these people, they do not see who has ordered because they do not accept authority. They will say, "It is by chance.'' They have not seen who has ordered, who is that authority. They cannot explain; therefore they say "Chance."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They have no science of astrology, so they cannot understand the universe and how it's working.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Astrology... I don't think they believe in astrology. There is no question of astrology. We practically we see that one man ordered to be hanged by the justice, he has to be hanged. That is destiny. One has not seen who has ordered, but he sees that "This man is being hanged.'' He cannot explain; he says, "By chance.'' So whose explanation is right? The chance explanation or the destiny explanation-which is right?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Actually, logically, I cannot see how there is any chance, not a single. When I was a child I used to give an argument to my friend, and he used to say, "A chance. Everything is chance. It is like a lottery ticket.'' I said to him, "If you don't buy the lottery ticket and win $50,000, then that is chance. But if you buy the lottery ticket..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is chance?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> There is no chance, because you bought the lottery ticket, so...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your destiny. Then your destiny.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They miss the order and the controller and the organizer...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is whole purpose-how to defy God. That is their whole plan.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes, the mind is attracted to that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there are always two classes of men: <i class="calibre3">devatā</i> and demons. Demon class will always say like that, "There is no God. We are everything.'' <i class="calibre3">Devatā</i> class, they will always believe in. That is the difference, <i class="calibre3">devatā</i> class. This struggle will always be there. (Sanskrit) There are two classes of men throughout the whole universe. One is called <i class="calibre3">daiva</i> and the other is called <i class="calibre3">asura</i>. The <i class="calibre3">Viṣṇu-bhaktaḥ bhaved daivaḥ.</i>(?) Those who are devotees of the Lord, they are <i class="calibre3">daiva</i>. And <i class="calibre3">asura</i> (Sanskrit). And those who are not devotees, they are just the opposite number, they are <i class="calibre3">asura</i>. So <i class="calibre3">asura</i> class will always (coughs) say like that. And there is always fight between the two, even in higher planetary systems. Only Brahmaloka, Satyaloka, there are no more <i class="calibre3">asuras</i>. So <i class="calibre3">asura</i> class will always fight like that, and <i class="calibre3">devatā</i> class will always defy. But for God everyone is equal, because all of them are sons of God. Therefore an attempt is always going on to turn the <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> to become devotees. For this purpose God Himself comes, He sends His representative, how these rascal <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> can be turned into devotees. Otherwise the <i class="calibre3">asura</i> class will always be there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That's the business of the representative.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because God is equal to everyone. He sees that these rascal <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> are misguided, so He sends His representative, He comes Himself, there is <i class="calibre3">śāstras</i>, guidance, and everything. The whole propaganda is how these rascal <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> can be turned into <i class="calibre3">devatā</i>. This is equality in the eyes of God. Very simple thing. Just like government puts a person into prison house. The idea is to correct him. Not that government is enemy of a class of men, they are put into the prison house. Government is equal. But there is department of punishing this... (aside:) (indistinct) Government is equal to everyone, but there is this department of reformation which is called jail department. He's punished so that he may come to his senses that "I have done wrong.'' But unfortunately there are stubborn criminals, they are not corrected. They go and again come, go and again come. One term finished, another term. One term finished... That is transmigration. One term finished, punishment, and another term begins. He creates another term. So that is <i class="calibre3">daiva netreṇa</i>. That is superior arrangement. Now this rascal has finished his human form of life, now again he has committed so many sins, let him become a dog. Again comes to the human form of life, again one chance is given. This not good, but he does not accept, so again he becomes a tree-stand up for ten thousand years. Nothing is a chance. Everything is under supreme control. <i class="calibre3">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 3.27]. But he is a rascal. He simply defies and suffers. One man is being slapped with shoes, so he is shameless, he says, "Oh, you have beaten me with shoes. All right, if you touch my wife, I'll sue you.'' Then the wife is beaten with shoes, then he says, "Oh, you have beaten my wife. All right, touch my son, I will sue you.'' In this way every member is being beaten with shoes, and he is simply challenging that "I'll sue, I'll sue.'' This is going on. He's punished one after another, but still he is so shameless that still he defies the authority. That is called <i class="calibre3">asura</i>. They're not very intelligent. "Next time I will see. Wait millions of years, I shall see...'' So we have to deal with <i class="calibre3">asuras</i>. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's why it's so difficult.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> That's why it's so difficult.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That is a devotee's business.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. That is devotee. Because God wants it that these rascals may be turned into sane man. That is God's plan. Otherwise why does He comes? <i class="calibre3">Yadā yadā hi dharmasya glānir bhavati bhārata<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.7]. Huh? <i class="calibre3">Paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.8]<i class="calibre3">-</i>two class, <i class="calibre3">sādhu</i> and <i class="calibre3">duṣkṛtinaḥ</i>. So to punish these <i class="calibre3">duṣkṛtinaḥ</i> there is reformation. That is not God's enemy, reformation. As the father gives slap to rogue child, that is also kindness. So these two processes are going on, <i class="calibre3">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām</i>. <i class="calibre3">Dharma-saṁsthāpanārthāya</i>. Then what is that <i class="calibre3">dharma</i>? <i class="calibre3">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</i> [Bg. 18.66]. That is <i class="calibre3">dharma</i>. So to deal with the <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> is not so easy job, but we have to do that. You should not be discouraged. So <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> may be reformed or not be reformed, but because you are trying this job on behalf of Kṛṣṇa, He will recognize you. Your service will be recognized. Not that you attempted, therefore you must be successful. You may be unsuccessful. It does not matter. But you have tried your best, and that will be recognized. (pause) And these <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> are trying to become happy by material advancement of knowledge. They're not happy-struggling-but this is called will-o'-the-wisp, phantasmagoria. Actually, they are not happy, they cannot be happy, but they are trying. How they can be happy? Nature is there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are falsely proud of their achievements.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <i class="calibre3">asura</i>. That is, that means <i class="calibre3">asura</i>. They have already tried the moon excursion, failure, again do it. This will be a failure, again do it. <i class="calibre3">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.5.30]. Repeatedly chewing the chewed. That is their business. One excursion-failure. It is already chewed. Whatever possibility finished-again chewing: "Let me see if there is any juice.'' Because they have no other business. <i class="calibre3">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 7.5.30]. <i class="calibre3">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām</i>. <i class="calibre3">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā</i>. There are already discussed.</div>
<div class="Verse">matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā<br class="calibre2"/> mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām<br class="calibre2"/>adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ<br class="calibre2"/>punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>7.5.30]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is their business. Failure, again; failure, again. One war started, all the city bombarded-finished-again start, again reconstruct. And when the reconstruct finished, again war. Again bomb it, again reconstruct.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Sometimes boys come here and they are involved in impersonal meditation. They want liberation...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is their business. Let them do. You try to understand the position. Meditation is also something. <i class="calibre3">Asuras</i>, they do not take to meditation. Meditation is something beginning to the path of <i class="calibre3">devatā</i>. <i class="calibre3">Dhyānāvasthita</i>. If they are actually serious then they can profit. Meditation is not always bad, if they are properly guided. But that is not the business of the <i class="calibre3">asuras</i>. They say, "On whom I shall meditate?'' The <i class="calibre3">asuras</i> do not do that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They have special meditation for <i class="calibre3">asuras.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They have special classes in meditation for <i class="calibre3">asuras</i>. They give them some meaningless word to meditate upon.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the purpose of this meditation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> To make..., to relax the mind.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is another thing. Material. That is, er, Transcendental Meditation. (long pause)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> How can we convince them?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? How can you convince? They are <i class="calibre3">asuras.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> No, those who doing some meditation that are Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they are also <i class="calibre3">asuras</i>. They do not know what is the meaning of meditation. That is psychology. It is not meditation. Or some medical treatment. Meditation is different, real meditation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What is... What is real meditation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Real meditation is to find out the Supersoul within the core of the heart. That is real meditation. God is situated in everyone's heart, so the yogis, they try to find out the Supersoul within the heart. That is real yogi. <i class="calibre3">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginam</i>. This is real yogi, trying to contact the Supersoul. They are searching after the God in His all-pervading feature. But, ah, some of them, they want to become one. That is asuric. One with God, that is asuric. Because they are being defeated by God, so therefore they want to become God to stop this defeat. That is asuric. Therefore they will never be able to be, but they are trying for it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> It is the highest blasphemy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> It is the highest blasphemy, isn't it? If one says, "I am God."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, highest ignorance, highest rascaldom. (laughter) Yes. How one can become God? If one can become God, that means the such-and-such, he was God. Then how he has become dog? That is another rascaldom, ambition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> A devotee is only supposed to want service, and sometimes he very much wants to be liberated to be finished with all this difficulty, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Is it very contaminating?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not contaminating, not in the highest stage. That is not contaminating. If the devotee wants liberation, then they're in the lower stage. Actually, a devotee, he is already liberated. Why he shall aspire after liberation?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Pure devotee's liberated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore when he's purified, he's already liberated. There is no question of his aspiring after liberation. He's already liberated. <i class="calibre3">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 14.26]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> If the devotee's purified, he's convinced that if he becomes purified he will be free.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The whole devotional process is purificatory process. The more he is purified, he becomes high-class devotee. But the process is the path of liberation. Just like mango. The green mango, this green mango will be ripe mango. The same mango. You cannot say that the ripe mango is different from the green mango. It is a process. By the process the same green mango becomes yellow; then it is perfect. (long pause, devotees chant <i class="calibre3">japa</i> in background) What is that point, there are thirty theories or something about this Mars planet?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Twenty-two theories.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You just told?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are trying to understand the geology of the planet and how the surface of the planet was formed, what...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have different... [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They are so foolish that they say these experiments are very wonderful. They are very proud of these experiments...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Because they do not know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, the result is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wonderful. Do not know. Wonderfully do not know. The platform is, "Do not know"; it is still wonderful. Wonderful foolish, like that. The platform remains "Do not know,'' but still it is wonderful.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Their most intelligent philosophers and thinkers always say...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> Their most intelligent philosophers and thinkers, they always say that the more that we know, the more we understand that we don't know. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is wonderful. The more they become convinced that "I do not know,'' that is wonderful. When they'll know?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then they make these statements that "The earth is this old...'' They make statements like "The earth is this many years,'' without any factual basis.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are wonderful rascals. Shameless. Wonderful shameless rascals. They say that the moon planet is desert, vacant, no living entities. And we say that it is the planet for the pious men to live there very opulently for ten thousand... Of these two classes of knowledge, which is better? We have got some evidence from the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>, but they have no evidence. They are simply speculating. Now this moon..., er, Mars, they'll find the same result. Then how long they will go on like this?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> As long as the society is godless...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> As long as the society's godless, then...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how long they'll present the same theory over and over again? They're already putting the same thing. They have concluded in the moon there is rocks and sand, nobody can live. The same thing they are saying in a different way, and in the end they will have to say like that. Because they have no knowledge, it is simply theoretical. And they have no other alternative but to say the same thing again and again. What they will say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They say on Mars there can be life because the conditions are a little bit like earth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose there is life, then what you gain?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say that our knowledge now is not mere theoretical because now we have gone there.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what profit you have gained? You have spent some millions of dollars, that's all.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> More theories.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chants <i class="calibre3">japa</i>)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The government encourages this spending of money while the citizens are unhappy and cannot be safe in their own city.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you must have such government. <i class="calibre3">Dasyu-dharyogi</i> (?). They will snatch your money by force. You cannot say anything. That is punishment. Godless civilization, that is punishment, that your own government will snatch, by force, take away your hard labor accumulation, by taxes. That is written in the <i class="calibre3">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</i>. You cannot fight. You will be harassed in so many ways you will become mad. <i class="calibre3">Ācchinna-dāra-draviṇā yāsyanti giri-kānanam</i>. Hopelessly you will leave hearth and home and go to the forest. This godless civilization will be punished like that. That day is coming like that. Nobody will be peaceful. They will be mad. Just like when a man becomes mad, he commits suicide, he blows off his head. This will be done. There will be no rain-this is one punishment-and scarcity of food and heavy taxation by government. They are all mentioned. What more suffering you want? But still they are advancing, scientists.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One of the most practical things that people give credit to the scientists for is that they have invented these insecticides, these things that kill insects. But now they find that after they spray, after a few generations, the insects become immune to this, and they become stronger.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The antibiotics medicine, at a certain stage it does not work. If too much antibiotic injection is given, then the (indistinct) does not work.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> It is like that with this syphilis disease, this venereal disease. Now they cannot kill certain strains of it. They cannot do anything about it. (indistinct) That is a big disease in United States.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is always, Western disease. It is a Western disease. <i class="calibre3">Vairanga-roga</i> (?). In the <i class="calibre3">Ayur Veda</i> it is called <i class="calibre3">vairanga-roga</i>. <i class="calibre3">Fairanga</i>, <i class="calibre3">ferengi</i>, <i class="calibre3">ferengi</i>, the Westerners are called <i class="calibre3">ferengi</i>, the <i class="calibre3">vairanga-roga</i>. So this syphilis disease was imported in India by these Europeans. Before, it was not there. There is a medicine called (indistinct) injection. Fifty years ago it was one rupee, four annas, price. But during the wartime the same medicine was selling at nineteen (ninety?). On black market.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> That is their nature-they will always try to exploit.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. I have seen it, one rupee, four annas, the price goes nineteen (ninety?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> There is a story about a man who made some perfect cloth that would never get dirty, never get torn. So he made a suit out of it and he was trying to market it. So he went to the capitalists and said, "Now I have made some perfect cloth.'' And they did not like it because they could not sell more cloth after they sold this. No one would want anything else. And the workers, they did not like it either because they would lose their jobs. No one would buy.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> They tried to kill him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's telling a story.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A story.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> The story is about perfect cloth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Perfect?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Perfect cloth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cloth.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Jñānagamya:</span> So everyone was trying to kill him because he had this perfect cloth and it would put everybody out of business, because their business was based on exploitation, on things wearing out, getting old, having to be renewed.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (indistinct) Hare Kṛṣṇa. (devotees offer obeisances) (end)</div>
