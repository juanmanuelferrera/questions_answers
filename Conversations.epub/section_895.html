<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Of course, evolutionary theory is that in the beginning, all the different species weren't there. Only simple forms, and then they..., more complex ones came about.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom they came? Dropped from the sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Some theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) has joined us, about fifty friends, Indians, they have left him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> [break] I plan to go to Detroit tomorrow. [break].... shall we leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Tomorrow. We are leaving also tomorrow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...of the garden, they are not clean. They should be clean. Just like in front of our, this temple, the footpath is very clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> There's stones in the garden, washed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Grass, water it, cleanse. <span class="Italic">Mandira-mārjanādau.</span> That is also <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> [break] Do you think you'll be able to see the temple either today or tomorrow and give me some ideas on how to utilize the building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> I can arrange it with Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa? When you're available?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. After ten. (japa) [break].... lights are working in order, unless there is some supervision above this lightning system. If somebody says, "This is going on automatically," is that very sane? <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> Light is matter, combination of glass and iron, and it is going on with order without any upper supervision? How these rascals say like that? Because immediately they do not see who is pulling on the wire, "There is no (indistinct)." How poor knowledge they have. And they are passing on scientist. Why you are stopping car if there is no supervision? You can pass on, nobody will see. Why one is afraid of not transgressing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They know the authority is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rascal, how you think there is no authority? There is no sinful, and there is no..., everything is all right? Go on. Go to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> I remember, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when I was young I was brought up in the Catholic church, and I learned to fear God, and be afraid of God. But then as I went to high school, due to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> .... association, everything is bad(?). So degraded condition, there is no good association. Therefore I say that we require a first-class man section. A first-class.... All third class, fourth class. Even the so-called priests, they are also fourth-class, fifth-class men. Indulging in homosex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> This priest who joined us, who's now your man, he said that although he was a priest, he smoked three packs of cigarettes a day and drank all kind of wine. He began to drink wine, he said, because in their mass, in their ceremony, the priest drinks wine. And then then he became addicted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals are priests. And they'll protect religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We used to have a Reverend who was in charge of our local church when I was a child. And when we used to go on outings, sometimes they used to organize outings for children to the seaside and everything, and they would stop at a public house and they would give refreshments. So all the children would get lemonade, like that, and the grown-ups would go and drink some beer or something. So the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their father, mother drinking, and the child is given some soft drinking. And learning how to drink when he'll grow up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This vicar, he used to sit, and he used to sip small glass of clear liquid. So everyone thought he was drinking water, but then once they checked, and it was pure vodka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> While speaking lie "I was drinking water." (japa) (break-converses in Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Prabhupāda, I'm trying to get one radio station you know, so far the, so that we make a Hare Kṛṣṇa program. So the radio is the big media for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee priest (Bhakta Gene):</span> I'm told that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, (laughs) how are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Very fine, very fine. I'm told that you met with Thomas Merton some years ago. Is this correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The French?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> No, the Cistertian monk from Kentucky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> You didn't meet with him? He was supposedly the most prominent mystical writer within the Catholic Church in the past one hundred years. His writings gained tremendous prominence in the past..., oh, the past twenty-five years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Prominence amongst whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Uh, amongst Christians. And non-Christians as well. He made a trip to the East. He had an accident in the East and was electrocuted. Oh, this is some ten years ago now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> He wrote that original introduction for your first <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> published by Macmillan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Well, this raises a question in my mind, Your Grace. Within Christianity there has been a history of mysticism from 100 A.D. to the present. Now there have been some prominent mystics, a few prominent mystics, and a great many not so prominent. Now how do you classify these men, these Christian mystics, Protestant as well as Catholic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is some yogic mysticism. It has nothing to do with spiritual life. They want to see some miracles, generally, ordinary public. So this mystic power, show some miracles and make them astonished. That's all. It has nothing to do with spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Perhaps you misunderstood me. I was referring to truly devotional mystics, such as St. John of the Cross, St. Francis of Assisi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is devotional service, where is the need of mysticism? There is no need. God is my master, I am His servant. Where there is necessity of this nonsense mysticism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> I think that the term mysticism, so many people have been playing with, particularly here in the United States.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many people, we have nothing to do with so many people. If you are actually servant of God, so God is there, you are servant. So your transaction is there. Just to carry out the orders of God. That's all. Why do you want mysticism? Just to show some jugglery to the people? You serve God. That's all. And it is very simple thing, what God orders. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> Where is the question of mysticism? There is no question of mysticism. God says "Just always think of Me. Offer your obeisances and worship Me." That's all. Where is the need of mysticism? It is all jugglery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I tell you, I think there's a wrong conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You think in your way. There is no meaning in your thinking unless you come to the line.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, sir. There's a wrong conception, that mysticism. They say it comes with the spiritual advancement. I think that's what he's getting at.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The problem is that we are suffering in this material world life after life, and our aim is how to again go back to home, back to Godhead. That they do not know. They are showing some mysticism. Stop death. Then I shall see your mysticism. What is this nonsense mysticism? Can you stop death? Is it possible? Then what is the meaning of this mysticism? All bogus. My problem is that I am accepting one body and suffering, because as soon as I get this material body, I have to suffer. Then I am creating another body. I die. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> And again begins another chapter. In this way, from this grass life to the demigods, I am simply changing body and dying and taking birth. This is my problem. So what mysticism will do? But that they do not know, what is the problem. That is clearly stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi-duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> This is your problem. You are repeatedly taking birth and dying, and so long you are living there are so many troubles. <span class="Italic">Jarā-vyādhi.</span> Especially old age and disease. So this is the problem. What mysticism will help you? Will the mysticism stop your birth, death, old age and disease? Then that is mysticism. Otherwise, what is the use of such nonsense things. [break] ...misleading from the real path. They do not know what is the aim of life, what is the problem of life. They create some mysticism, and some rascal people are after them. That's all. "Here is mystic."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> How important is the association with the devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Satāṁ prasaṅgān mama vīrya-saṁvido bhavanti hṛt-karṇa-rasāyanāḥ kathāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga</span> wanted. Association of devotees. That is wanted. Then our life will be successful. Not mysticism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I think Bhakta Gene wants to know if you recognize that there are any great devotees in that Christian tradition. Do we recognize that any of those Christian saints were great devotees? Did they develop love of God? Or what's the comparison?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know, I have not studied Christianity. But if anyone has developed love, that is perfection. So there is not question of my knowing or not knowing. If actually one has developed love for God, he's perfect. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> This is what prompted me to ask my first question, Your Grace. What has brought me here has been my search...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is God's desire that you are sincere, you have come. Now utilize the association and the opportunity, your life will be successful. We have got enough books to convince you about this science. So you read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> I am convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why one should be after mysticism? What is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> It was the mystics that brought me here. This was the thing. It was their love of God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is mystic? We don't show any mystic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> No. The term, we're having trouble with the term. The term "mystic" was applied to transcendentalists within the church to show a difference between them and the traditionalists. The traditionalists were those who paid attention to the script.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by traditionalist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> The traditionalists are strictly the old Roman Catholic traditionalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from Roman or, what do you mean by traditionalist?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Those who abided by tradition rather than the scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, scripture, they have no respect for scripture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> Well, they had respect for scriptures, but they had more respect for tradition. Ritualistic laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the tradition?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The way the church would apply the ritual rather than actually trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is required. That is required. Just like we are worshiping the Deity. This is traditional. From time immemorial. So how you can reject? This is the way. <span class="Italic">Śravaṇaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇoḥ smaraṇaṁ pāda-sevanam [SB </span>7.5.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> But so much of the tradition within the Roman Church has no reference to any scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that has not been properly done. Otherwise, just like here, we have got temple, regulative principle. If it is done properly, the result will be there. If it is improperly done, then there is no result. How these boys, European, American, they never knew what is Kṛṣṇa. But on account of this following the traditionalism, they are becoming devotees. It is practical, you can see. Simply theoretical knowledge will not do. Must be practical. That is traditionalism. <span class="Italic">Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Instruction. Tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.</span> This is traditional. One has to follow the traditional rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">Utsāhān niścayād dhairyāt tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt</span> [<i class="calibre3">Upadeśāmṛta </i>3]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all one must be enthusiastic: "I shall become devotee." Then, <span class="Italic">utsāhān dhairyāt,</span> with patience. Then <span class="Italic">niścayāt,</span> with conviction: "Yes, I am following the rules and it will be successful." And <span class="Italic">tat-tat-karma-pravartanāt.</span> You have to follow the traditional rules and regulations. <span class="Italic">Sato vṛtteḥ,</span> you must be honest. <span class="Italic">Sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">.</span> And these things in the association of devotees. <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.</span> Then your <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> devotional life, will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Some of these Christian mystics would say it's more important to directly contact God within your own heart. These traditions are not as important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is there already. Where is the contact? God is there already. It is no question of contacting. He is already, but you are blind, you cannot see. Therefore if you follow the rules and regulations, then you'll see. You'll see. Otherwise we'll not see. God is there. God is everywhere. God is here. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have no eyes to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakta Gene:</span> These are almost the very words that Francis of Assisi stated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This question was raised in Melbourne. And that is perfectional. He was embracing tree. So I told, "This is perfection." Perfection means he'll see everywhere God and everything in God. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think we should go back now, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam. Mayā.</span> You just explain this verse.</div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">You understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa says that "Everything is resting in Me. I am present all over the universe, impersonally. I can't be seen. Everything is resting on Me. At the same time, I'm outside of everything. I'm independent." He maintains His personality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ.</span> "I'm not there." So this is conception of God. Nothing can exist without God. But that does not mean everything is God. We have to understand this philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> I just want to ask..., Bhaktisiddhānta Prabhu, Bhaktisiddhānta your spiritual master. How you spent the days, your young age, with Bhaktisiddhānta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes. Bhaktisiddhānta, your spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Young age? I was not with him. I was householder. But I used to meet with him. I was following his instructions. [break] ...valley? (indistinct) valley? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Viśvakarmā:</span> That's another section, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That verse, can anyone remember? <span class="Italic">Yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇaḥ?</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yatra yogeśvaraḥ kṛṣṇo<br class="calibre2"/>yatra pārtho dhanur-dharaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtir<br class="calibre2"/>dhruvā nītir matir mama<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.78]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So what is the explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Where Lord Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna are there, there the victory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Then all mystic power is there. That means where there is Kṛṣṇa and His pure devotee, the whole mystic power is there. <span class="Italic">Tatra śrīḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> <span class="Italic">Vijayo bhūtiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Tatra śrīr vijayo bhūtiḥ.</span> Devotee, he hasn't got to try separately for all these things. It will come automatically. That is mysticism. (laughter) (converses in Hindi) (end)</div>
