<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...plan for wasting time. (devotees laugh) So the material world means they have got different devices for wasting time, not for utilizing time. Is it correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> It is considered one of our major problems, leisure time. People are having more time on their hands and they do not know what to do with it. So the government, they're scratching their heads inventing things for people to waste their time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the difficulty. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they are rascal, they do not know how to utilize time, what is the aim of life, where you have to go. These things they don't know. So they must waste time. So it is the... Just like child. He wastes time in so many ways. It is the duty of the parents, guardians, to cr..., synchronize his activities so that he may not waste his time. It is the duty of the guardians. Similarly these rascals, they're wasting time. You have to engage them in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then their time will be utilized. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> ...in Holland wasn't any fuel Sundays, and the people could go outside with the cars, and then the statistics say that the fight between the family increased so, so much the police went... They went to the houses to, just to separate the people because there was fighting so much because they didn't have anywhere to go on Sundays. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. It has become a problem, ah, to remain at home. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...society, Śrīla Prabhupāda, it would train up brahminical qualities. But in the people in general, how can we engage them also in Kṛṣṇa consciousness? How can we provide them a means to use their leisure time to perfect their lives?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Is it very difficult?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> To get them to do it is difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, let's call them in our temple, be practiced. Therefore our society is the most important society. We can teach people how to utilize time properly and be perfect. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...well you utilize your time, Śrīla Prabhupāda, every second is engaged in Kṛṣṇa's service. And our advanced Godbrothers, they've also learned this art. The vast majority of us, we haven't quite got the hang of it yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is practiced. As by practicing you become a first-class drunkard, similarly by practicing you can become a first-class Kṛṣṇa conscious. It is equal. <span class="Italic">Abhyāsa-yoga-yuktena cetasā nānya-gāminā [Bg. </span>8.8]<span class="Italic">. Abhyāsa.</span> Practice. In association the practice is very easily done. Just like you are saying, that you are engaged. So by association you can learn also. The association is very important. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda. You're very, very regulated, almost down to the minute in your activities. This is also a big help in utilizing time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Avyartha kāla tam</span>(?) That explains the... This is... This should be our aim. Not a single moment is wasted. If you try that "How I'm wasting my time," then you'll utilize it. You should always remember. Not a single moment should be wasted. That is advised by Rūpa Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Avyartha kāla tam.</span> <span class="Italic">Vyartha</span> means spoiling. <span class="Italic">Avyartha</span> means not spoiling. <span class="Italic">Avyartha kāla.</span> He should be always conscious that "I am not wasting my time." Then it will be done. Kṛṣṇa... [break] ...on the street. The bums, they also utilize, that they want to see that not a moment is wasted without drinking. (devotees chuckle) Yes, they actually do that. They want to drink only, twenty-four hours. As soon as the bottle is finished, they're finding somebody who will pay one dollar, and purchase another small bottle. They're doing only business this. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...the holy name and devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> You want us to be drunkards on the holy name, and be like those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. There is eight kinds of transcendental transformation... (pause) (devotees chant <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...foolish play tennis, and the lazy foolish they play golf. (Prabhupāda laughs) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...less dangerous than the active foolish. (devotees chant <span class="Italic">japa)</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is indicated by Śrī Kṛṣṇa that when we approach a bona fide spiritual master our relationship is twofold. We render service and then we also make inquiry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Now, you have answered all our inquiries so thoroughly in our books that to make inquiry at this point seems like..., you've already answered all the questions. So how may we... What is the proper relationship at that point to make inquiry?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Read the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Read the books, yes. Why I'm working so hard? Read the books. [break] ...don't find him in the class also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> Who should, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> He got married yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> I heard yesterday he was married.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> He went to officially. I... We tried yesterday to convince him, but he would not listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Officially he's married now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...seen that one who is married, he's lamenting, and who is not married, he's also lamenting. Is it not? Ah? One who is married, he's thinking, "Why did I marry? I would have remained free." He's lamenting. And who is not married, "Oh, I did not accept wife. I would have been happy." (laughs) (Hindi) There's a Hindi... It just like (Hindi). One who has eaten, he's also lamenting, and who has not eaten, he's also lamenting. [break] <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha... </span>That is said in Sanskrit. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛpaṇā,</span> by one's sex life he gets some children and he's... As soon as there is child, there is suffering. The child is suffering and the parents also suffering to take care. So, again he begets another child. Therefore it is said <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> Behind this child-producing there is so much difficulties and trouble. He knows that. But again pro... Doing the same thing. <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> Therefore a sane person, <span class="Italic">kaṇḍūtivan manasijaṁ viṣaheta dhīraḥ.</span> Therefore one who is <span class="Italic">dhīra,</span> one who becomes sober, he tolerates the sensations, itching sensations. It is after all itching sensation. So one who can tolerate the itching sensation, he saves so much trouble. But one who cannot, he's implicated, immediately. Either illicit or legitimate, it is trouble. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi...</span> That is the only happiness in this material world. That is only happiness. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who wants to remain in this material world, his only happiness is sex life. He has no other happiness. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham.</span> And that is very abominable, <span class="Italic">tuccham</span> happiness. What is this happiness? But they cannot understand. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham. </span>Itching, between the two hands. It produces so many bad results, but he's not satisfied. "All right, I've done once, that's all right. One children is all right, one or two." But no, then contraceptive, abortion, so many things. But the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is so strong, it will induce, "Yes, do this." Again implicated. [break] Becoming master of the dog, he has become servant of the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see practically. A man keeps the dog to give him protection when he'll be attacked by somebody. But to wait for that time he has to give twenty-four-hour service to the dog. (dog barking)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think he knows you're talking about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think the dog knows you're talking about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows everything. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Everything looks brand new, looks very different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> This is the first time we've gone this direction, everything looks different, looks like a total different place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) This is material life. We are rounding sometimes this way, sometimes that way, and we are thinking "new." (devotees laugh) <span class="Italic">Ei rūpe brahmāṇḍa bhramite kona</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> In this way you are wandering all over the universe. Find out something new. But there is nothing new. Everything is old. [break] ...a living entity is offered change of the body. You see? When he becomes fatigued of this life, "It's so troublesome"-old men generally think like that. So he has to change another, another new body, child. Since born he is taken care, he thinks "Now, I have got so comfortable life." And again becomes old, disgusted, so he cannot live disgusting, therefore Kṛṣṇa is so kind: "All right, change body again." <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Chewing the chewed. The business is the same, but changing body gives some relief. Just like these men, the business is they're wasting time by changing, wasting time at home, come to the golf club. That's all. The business is the same-wasting time, either here or there. Kṛṣṇa is giving so much facilities. Sometimes, "All right, you become tree." "All right, some, become a serpent," "All right, you become a demigod," "All right, you become a human being," "All right, you become king," "You become a cobbler," "You go to the heavenly planets," "Go to the hellish planets." Varieties is there. Kṛṣṇa is so kind that He's changing varieties, atmosphere of life. But he's packed up in this material world. That freedom... He's asking for freedom, but he does not know the freedom is the shelter of Kṛṣṇa. That he'll not accept. Therefore Kṛṣṇa has arranged so many varieties. In disgust the Māyāvādīs, they want to make the varieties variety-less, <span class="Italic">nirviśeṣa.</span> And the Buddhists they want to make it zero. But that is also not possible. Remain zero for some time. Again he will want varieties. Big, big Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> they preach so much <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,</span> but again they come to the political work, social work. Simply remain as <span class="Italic">brahma,</span> "I am <span class="Italic">brahma,</span>" you cannot remain for many days. Then he has to accept these material varieties. Variety is the mother of enjoyment, so therefore our proposition is "Come to the real variety, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then your life will be successful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The Māyāvādīs, they not only misunderstand the nature of the Absolute, they misunderstand the function of the <span class="Italic">jīva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. When one misunderstands, he misunderstands everything. One who commits mistake, he can commit mistakes in so many ways. They want to merge into the Absolute. They think that there is no variety, to avoid this variety. Ah? Just like sometimes one is suffering from some disease, they commit suicide. He thinks, "I'm suffering. If I commit suicide, then everything will be stopped." But he does not know that by committing suicide he'll increase another set of varieties of miserable conditions of life. He'll become ghost. And becoming ghost, you cannot enjoy anything grossly. The subtle body will create disturbance. Therefore ghost creates disturbance. He hasn't got gross body to enjoy. They're ghostly haunted; therefore a male ghost haunts over woman, woman ghost haunts over man. You know that? It so happens. Ghostly haunted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> In the New York temple they had a ghost upstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> The New York temple in Brooklyn...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> This is, this was the old house which was used by nuns. And in the upstairs floor, on the complete top, there used to be some nuns that were dying there, very old nuns. And when they moved into the temple there was ghosts, still there, still there is there. There's one room, it still comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Yes. The ghost comes sometimes. They chant and put incense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā?</span> But she does not go away? Or does not do any harm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> They don't let anyone sleep in that room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Because everyone is haunted. There's many people have seen the ghost.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Many devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But ghost cannot remain where there is chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] In India, all collections should be utilized for Vṛndāvana temple. I shall personally supervise. So bring all collection to me.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Rāmeśvara said he had the figures, but I have to get them from him. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is human life. Your choice, make your choice, which way. Again death or deathlessness. Stop death from you. This is human life. The <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs,</span> yogis, they're trying for death. There will be death. But for the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> devotees, there is deathlessness. <span class="Italic">Punar janma jayāya.</span> For conquering over next birth. Rascal civilized man does not know what is next life, how death can be stopped. Nothing else. Big, big scholars of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they do not understand. The so-called scholars, they do not understand. These things are there in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. Yad gatvā na nivartante [Bg. 15.6].</span> They do not understand. They say, "What is this?" They do not understand. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...people could not enjoy so much in this life, they worry more about the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> When people realize they cannot enjoy so much in this life, they worry more about what is going to happen to them in the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, how does... They do not know what is next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They make it zero. Therefore, closing the eye. "There is no next life. Finished. There is no next life." In that way they're satisfied. Just like the rabbit. There is danger, enemy, he closes his eyes. He thinks there is no danger. (devotees laugh) So these rascals are like that. Because they cannot accommodate that this life is so troublesome, again, next life... So that they can realize. Next life means again troublesome; that's why they sometimes commit suicide. They think that after suicide it will be zero, so no trouble. These are all ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> In psychology that's called repression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Repression.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Taking something which is a fact, but refusing to believe it, pushing it out of your mind, repressing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> There is a philosophy called Stoicism. They believe they... This life is meant to suffer, so they should just become very sturdy to suffer a great deal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So sturdy or not sturdy, you have to suffer. How you can check? We cannot change by simply... Becoming sturdy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> No, stoic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> It's a philosophy, a school of philosophy, stoic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. What is their conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> That the world is very, is full of suffering...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...so they become very sturdy to bear the suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Emotionless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one who can suffer without any protest, he's first-class man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> (laughs) Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not know how to stop suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The... Here is one class, they're trying to become very strong to tolerate suffering, and other philosophies, they're making everything zero. There is no question of not suffering, but making zero. No suffering, nor neither suffering. Suffering or not..., both of them abolished, dismissed. This philosopher is... "This suffering cannot be dismissed. Therefore you be strong to tolerate it." Other philosophers they say, "There is suffering, so make it zero." But both of them have no information that there is real life where there is no suffering. Still there is life. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is life, but no suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They're like owls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They deny. Just like the Puritans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Deny... You deny or accept, that is the... Suppose there is such life where you can simply dance, eat and live eternally, happy life. Would you not like to accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, of course, anyone would.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But they think no such thing would exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think, may think, but it is theoretical. Supposing there is such life, would you not accept it? You may believe, not believe. That is another chapter. First of all, this is our proposition, that there is a life like this. Would you like? So who would say "no"? Everyone will say, "Yes, I like." It is a question of understanding. There is such life, but because he is disappointed at being cheated, cheated, cheated, he thinks, "Here is also another cheating." Just see. Therefore Kṛṣṇa consciousness preaching means to convince them that there is life like this. That is propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> What would convince them that it is simply not another cheating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is cheating, it is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> But what would convince them of that? What qualities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see example, our. We are chanting, dancing, and eating nicely. What you are doing? You are simply talking nonsense. There is no peace in your life. And see our devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the proof, practical proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Practical proof that they cannot get purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Even though they have big posts...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, either purify or... You come with us and you will be purified. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura says, <span class="Italic">rādhā-kṛṣṇa bolo saṅge calo, ei-mātra bhikhā cāi.</span> We don't want anything from you. You, I shall give you eating. I shall give you everything. You simply come with me and chant. This is our propaganda. We don't say that "You do this, do that." We don't do anything. Simply come with us and chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Just like the Catholic church, in different places around the world they feed the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> But we cannot only... If we not only feed them, but give them chanting and dancing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...they will accept it as superior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Actually we can see that happening very practically. At Spiritual Sky many big, big businessmen they come, and they see how these boys are making money and yet they are singing and dancing all the time. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is practical. It's practical. Therefore in India we are considered as the richest community. They was a question in Parliament, "Wherefrom these Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement they get their money?" And the Parliament would reply, Home Member, that "They get money by distributing literature." This is the reply. This is recorded in the Parliament, Indian Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you simply push on our literature, then our movement is going, you must know. It is really going forward. And there will be no scarcity. You'll get everything. [break] Our neighbors they inquire, is it not? That, "You are living so happily, where do you get money?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The storekeepers, they inquire. They're envious, that "How these people enjoying life without earning, without working hard?" Now whole Bombay is surprised when you purchased this land.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So much fighting was there. Immediately I went and purchase and everything stopped. (devotees laugh) They are surprised. This man, they... You know there are two very stubborn parties who have cheated. Chaganlal, he advanced fifty-one thousand as advance, and when there was question of settlement, so he came, he wanted that "If you give me three <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> then I'll compromise." So I was prepared to pay him three <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> So that Mr. Ganotra, Mayor, I induced him just to make settlement. Then down he came-two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> twenty-five thousand. Then asked Mrs. Nair, "Now you'll pay this..." Where I have got... If he takes all money, then what shall I get? Then I had to settle with her how much he will pay. So she came from one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> to one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> forty thousand. So what is the balance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Sixty. Sixty... Eighty-five thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Eighty-five. So I said, "Yes, I'll pay it. Settle up. The balance I'll pay." Eighty-five thousand. The other man, what is called? Ratna Parik?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Chaganlal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Chaganlal this, I pay him extra eighty-five thousand. That is also black. No more white. So the black money was paid in this way, that the money was counted and it was put in a handbag, and it was locked by him. So the key was with him, and the bag was with me. As soon as court accepted the agreement, then I handed over, "Take this bag." Then again this Ratna Parik, he first of all proposed twenty thousand to sell that house. Then when I went there, he knew that he's settling at any cost, he said, "Now that twenty thousand was cost formerly. Now things have gone very high, I cannot sell." So he knows that we are eager to purchase. Then I said, "Then what do you want to do?" "Now I want thirty thousand." "All right, yes. Take it." I did not argue. In this way I settled up. And our Girirāja's father appreciated that "It is better a bad settlement than to prolong the case." So I took this policy. It is bad settlement, from twenty thousand to thirty thousand. But settled out. "I give you 85,000 black." But one thing I gain-that by cancelling the agreement, their proposal was that increase the price, twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> from fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> That was the arrangement between the attorneys. They cancelled the agreement and take twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> from him, and the balance should be divided by..., amongst us. That was the agreement. So that addition of twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> I satisfied Mrs. Nair by fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Saves 500,000, <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The attorneys were settling at seventeen <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> but by Kṛṣṇa's grace I was able to settle up fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> fifty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> You were able to convince her to settle up for less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> This was white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Yes, fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> fifty thousand white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> She must've been very surprised to receive the money, such a large payment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda;:</span> Yes. [break] ...only ten <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then Karandhara sent... How much you sent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Excuse me, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you sent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Sent twenty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty thousand. That was... Not two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> nowadays. Eight rupees. About one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> sixty thousand. Then we had about three <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> In this way, somehow or other, we paid seven, more than sixteen <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> Black, white, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> For Kṛṣṇa anything can be done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She was to be paid fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> fifty thousand, then stamp duty two <span class="Italic">lakhs</span>... Sixty thousand or six thousand? Then registration fee... Oh, it was very expensive. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...that at the end of this month the United States will be destroyed by the comet, the Kahutek comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Their demonic principles will be destroyed. They'll take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya, haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do they say... After destruction, then what is next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Oh, they all move to Mexico and Canada, so they wouldn't be in the way of the destruction. They don't know what's going to happen after that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So at the time of danger they'll go away. Very good. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Lord Jesus came to save the fallen souls...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> ...they are all running away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are so good Christian that at the time of danger, they're all going away to Canada. Just see-afraid of death, even though they are preaching themselves, priest, they are also the same common man, afraid of death. And if we people keep to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are not afraid of death. For going from one place to another, that's all. Going home, nobody becomes afraid going back to home. He becomes pleased. [break] You avoid death, there is no death. <span class="Italic">Viṣaya.</span>(?) If we simply practice this, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma... No more death. Finished death. This is a fact. [break] ...or do something for Kṛṣṇa. Don't waste time, single moment. Then your... No more death. Because this is deathless condition. And the changing of the body, that is momentary, that is all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So our service is deathless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? Deathless...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...yes, this is deathless position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> But if we stop serving...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You admit or not, theologian? (devotee laughs) Eh? Eh? Or you have got anything to say? This is deathlessness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Because the soul is acting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Looks like it may start raining a bit, Prabhupāda. We may cut over here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> And I can bring the car over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, what is that? We shall not die. (devotees laugh)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> We will melt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The soul cannot be wet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is pleasant. <span class="Italic">Viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate. </span>For a devotee, everything is very happy. There is no unhappiness. Any condition, they are happy. <span class="Italic">Viśvaṁ pūrṇa-sukhāyate. </span>For nondevotees everything is a problem. (devotees laugh) And for devotee everything is happiness. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> (thunder sounds in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is fact. This is not imaginary..., I mean to say... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> The suffering is due to sinful activities. So a devotee is not acting sinfully; he's fully surrendered... (end)</div>
