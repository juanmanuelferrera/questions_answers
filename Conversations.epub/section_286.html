<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The airplane botheration (sound of airplane flying over) was not in Switzerland. They do not come there for fear of rising...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> They fly higher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...peaks. Peaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Mountains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they don't come there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was the only place in the world there was no such sound. Otherwise everywhere. In America we have got so many temples. Even in West Virginia, hilly tract, there is also aeroplane. But less sound. Here it is near London, there must be. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Have you met Mother Theresa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is Mother Theresa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> She's a Christian mystic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> She's a Christian nun, and she has a mission in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Saint Theresa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Mother Theresa. She's living there now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> She's an Albanian nun who works in India and is, and has captivated the whole world just by the fantastic work she's done and is doing amongst the down, the outcastes and the desperately poor in the cities of India, particularly in Calcutta. And she's got disciples, young men, young women, joining her, where most of the other religious orders are desperately short. And the youth is being captivated by her, and they can't cope with the numbers wanting to join. And she was given a big speech in the Guild Hall in London and was the first person presented with an enormous sum of money by the Duke of Edinburgh, voted by the World Council of Churches as the outstanding religious person in the world. And people at her speech who heard, it brought the audience to its feet. And all she said in her speech was nothing more except "Love, love, love, love. Just go on giving and look for nothing back," which made an enormous impact, probably the greatest impact that anybody's making at present, in the world at present. (jet going over) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...satisfied to remain in the village. That is the defect of the modern civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> In India, you mean. You're talking of India now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> What about India? I mean, do they believe, the villagers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India, actually, they do so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The villagers, they have cows and land. That is sufficient for their economic problem. But the industrialists, they are alluring them, "To get more money, come here." So they are going to the cities. And the food production in the village is neglected. And therefore the food grain price is rising. Actually, everyone should be engaged to produce food, but the modern set-up of civilization is that few people are engaged in producing food, and others are eating. They are offering... They are artificially getting money. So they are offering paper, "Here is ten dollars." Although it is a paper, cheating. And they are captivated by cheating. They, they are thinking, "I have got now hundred dollars." What is this hundred dollars? It is paper. So some people are cheating and some people are being cheated. This is the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. But I think one has to be clever enough not to let people cheat you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Clever means that he must stay in his own land. He should not be cheated by the paper and go to the city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But we have to teach our young to be able to define between those who cheat and those who..., be able to tell people who...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The whole civilization is a plan of cheating others. That's all. And they're all sinful. According to our Vedic understanding, there are four things sinful, pillars of sinful life: illicit sex, unnecessary killing of animals, intoxication and gambling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you can lead a very happy life still, eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Our students are trained in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> There are a lot of very good people in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. You can see from your son. They can sit down anywhere. They can lie down. There is no artificial living. They are satisfied with nice foodstuff made from vegetable and milk. And chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa, holy name of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I see he's happy. But, you know, he came from a very happy home. So he should be happy, shouldn't he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Very happy home. Brothers and sisters. And we've all been very happy. And I hope he will remain happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's still happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, I can see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was happy; now he's happier. That is the difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. Oh, I don't think he's happier. (laughter) You are? I didn't think it was possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I didn't think it was possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because your son has come here, you may not be happier. But he happier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, you're saying this. I'm not saying this. I'm very disappointed that he is not continuing with education. I'm not sorry that... I'm happy for his happiness, wherever he is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is the... What is the purpose of education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You are a cultured man. You're educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Did you not learn...? Who gave you the talent to translate your Vedic scriptures?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Who gave you the talent, father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I'm asking that what is the best part of education? So far my school, college education is concerned, that is not being used here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, but you're cultured. You in your old age are getting tremendous comfort from being able to read and understand what the world is doing, the goodness of your books, and you have..., you're able to understand the spiritual way of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> If you couldn't, if you hadn't been educated, father, well, how would you be able to have...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, education is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Now, I, I, I don't... I am so happy that my son is happy, truthfully. But I am very distressed... And little boys, don't laugh because this is serious. Um. I am very distressed that none of these boys continue their education. What is going to happen to them when they are like you, when they're older, they have no talents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But your educational system, in the western countries, the, you have got big, big universities. Why the university students becoming hippies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, well, there're always a certain amount becoming hippies, in America, anywhere. But we must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But we must develop...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think the college students university students, they're all hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, but we must develop the good ones that have talent. We must develop them. You have the power to give these boys...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I mean to say that if the chance of education is there... In India there is no such big, big universities, facilities, but in your western countries you have got nice universities, nice teaching system. Why the result is hippie?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, but you... We're talking of you. You have got the power. But people follow you because they believe in you. So you have the power to educate them. And you're not hippies, are you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is that this simple, this education for eating, sleeping, mating and defending, this sort of education will not satisfy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, you're educated, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am educated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, but how many of these are?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But I am not educated only on this platform, eating, sleeping and sex life and defense. I am educated in a different platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you, aren't you translating your books still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Isn't that a great joy, a great joy to you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's... For translating of books it does not require... Of course, it requires when the purport of the translation is given. Otherwise,... Real thing is culture. That education is culture. Simply money-making education for maintaining this body, that education will not satisfy any more. Just like I told you, that despite all arrangements of education, why the young men are turning to be hippies? That is my question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, but not your followers. Your followers are not being hippies, people who follow you. Therefore you've got the people who you could help to become cultured like you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So my father educated me in a different way. Therefore I have come to this stage. My father never allowed me even to drink tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I'm disappointed in you. I came to see you because I felt that, being so cultured, you would want all your boys to have this culture and to have this, to have the best...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We've got, we've got this culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, but you haven't, you see. You're all, you're all young boys...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, your culture, your culture we don't have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...but you're not mature yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But the culture that he has, he's giving to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, but you're not mature. It takes years to become mature. Hurt, pain, happiness, everything together... You find God? Yes, I've found God. We all... I feel very close to God, and I feel very happy. But I would also still wish to be educated. And fortunately, I was given the chance to have an education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Education means to know God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> And I don't misuse it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is education. Our Vedic culture, the high class man is called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa,</span> you know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> Who knows God, he is called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Therefore culmination of education is to understand God. That is education. Otherwise, to get education how to nicely eat, how nicely sleep, how nicely have sex life, and how to defend, this education is there even in the animals. The animals also, they know how to eat, how to sleep, how to have sex life and how to defend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. It seems to worry you, this sex life. I mean, we, we don't take...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. I'm not worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...any notice if... It fits into its place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also necessary. This is also necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> It fits into the place in my life or our life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. This is also necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. It doesn't worry us at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But these four type of branches of education is not sufficient for human being. A human being, above all this education, must have the knowledge how to love God. And that is perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yeah, well, Michael was taught that when he was very small. The Jesuits saw to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> The Jesuits certainly did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So to understand God or how to love God, there is religious system. In every civilized human society, it doesn't matter whether it is Christianity or Hinduism or Mohammedanism or Buddhism, the aim, religious system is there in human society besides the education of eating, sleeping, mating and defending. That is there in the animal society. So a human being is distinct from the animal when he has education how to understand God and how to love Him. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, you've got a good tape there now, haven't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You've got a good tape there now. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is now wanting. Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not depriving people of their education. You get education how to eat, how to sleep, and that's all right. But side by side, you take education how to know God and how to love Him. That is our proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. I agree with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, I agree with you every time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't say that you stop all this education. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, I don't agree with you there. No, father, no, no. No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, I think they must...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can go on with your industries. You can go on with your university. But side by side, you become competent to know what is God and how to love Him. Then your life is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I could mention a lot of names that (are) still very close to God and brilliant men in science... Where would we be without our scientists, without our doctors, medicine? They all have to go to university and get a degree before they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I say. You get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, but we need them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, well, the some of your boys could be doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But simply to becoming doctor at a medical science will not save me. Unfortunately, they do not believe in the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, yes they do. I go to... I had a doctor who came to church-and Michael knows him-every Sunday, a very good man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mostly. I have spoken with many educated persons. In Moscow I was talking with Professor Kotofsky. He said, "Swamiji, after finishing this body, everything is finished." But he's a big professor. Generally, even they do believe next life, they do not believe it very seriously. If we actually believe there is next life, then we must be prepared: "What kind of next life I am going to have?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, well, father...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because there are eight million, four hundred thousand forms of life. The trees are also life, the cats and dogs, they are also life. And there are higher, intelligent persons in the higher planetary systems. They are also life. The worm in the stool, that is also life. So, calculating all of them, there are 8,400,000 species of life. So if I am going to have next life... <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> We have to change this body to another body. So our concern should be "What kind of body I am going to get next?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I agree for some people to, you especially, to think of this because you are a leader of your Vedic religion. But for everybody to do that, where would we be? We couldn't all sit down and think all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is that education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But we... You can also work and think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I mean to say, where is that education in the university to prepare the student for the next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh, but he must fit it in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> All the Catholic Universities all over the world are doing it. That's our main purpose, is to teach the young man and the young girl the success in this world, but above all,...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the next question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...is the success in the next, which means union with God for eternity. That's top priority. And following Christ's words, "Seek ye first the Kingdom of God," then all the other things are of very minor importance. It's closeness to God and return to be one with the Beatific Vision in heaven. That's the top priority, that's our aim in education, and that's what Michael was taught when he was at Sunnyhurst. And that he does well and gets a degree, yes, very good thing. He could be a doctor or an architect or a leader in commerce, what have you, of which all of which are essential for the well-being of the world. This time last year I was dead. I was picked up as unconscious in the corridor, and the doctors said that I had experienced... I was as near death as makes no difference. Well, if it hadn't been for the skill of the man that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...looked after me, I wouldn't be here this afternoon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So next life, how it will be ascertained? What kind of body I am going to next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I don't think it matters very much. I couldn't care less what's happening after I'm dead. All I know, there's not annihilation. I'm going to be joined with almighty God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it cannot be blind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> We're going to almighty God. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Not that I want another life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> We're going to almighty God when we die. We don't have to worry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> That's in his hands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the qualification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> We know. We...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everybody is going to God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. Everybody who believes in God. Yes. And leads a good life, does their best in this world, and that is truth for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the question comes: What is the good life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Obeying the commandments of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So if the commandment is "Thou shalt not kill," if somebody kills, so that is good life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, no, no. Father, you're being a bit unfair. It isn't... Interpretation, "Thou shalt not kill," thou shalt not unjustly take away life. If a man walks in this afternoon through those bushes with a revolver, I have every right... I'm not saying I'm going to do it, but I have every right to defend myself against that unjust aggressor. And if I kill him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can, you can protect yourself...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...that is justified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...from the aggressor, but when you kill innocent animal, what is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, well then... Yes. Well, again, that's got to be interpreted. We wouldn't be able to... What foo... How would we live on food? How do we live if we don't eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How we are living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How we are living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I don't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't kill animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I don't know what your food is, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, but you have a vegetarian diet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...which is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> A lot of people have that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, but... By, fa..., er, look at it this way. You've just said a few minutes ago there are eight million different kinds of life. Would you agree that the potato, the cabbage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...and what have you also has a life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Because there's vegetative life, there's sensitive life, there's rational life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest: :</span>...there's supernatural life, and there's a life of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> All right. And therefore-I'm not being facetious-when you boil those potatoes, you are taking away the life of that potato.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your philosophy? That you can take any life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> But you said, "Thou shall not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes. "Thou shall not kill." That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> But you kill the potato.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, suppose there is potato and there is your child. So would you like to kill your child in preference of potato?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> You've not answered my question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why this discrimination?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Why you've not answered my question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am answering you, that you are to kill, but you have to discriminate what kind of killing you shall do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I've just said that. I gave the example of the chap who comes to you with a revolver. I can maybe protect myself. You said... You're implying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. When somebody comes with a revolver, you defend. That is another thing. But if somebody's innocent, why you should kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> And I say I shouldn't. God said, "Thou shalt not kill."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you are killing animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, you're doing it when you eat your potatoes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the potato is not animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> It's a vegetable, life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> It starts with a little tiny seed. That's life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> It grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Potato is not animal. It is fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Is that tree alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Is that tree alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Has it got life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Are you doing anything wrong when you cut it down...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...to provide...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...to provide...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> You are doing something wrong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't cut down trees unnecessarily. Unnecessarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, but, but, uh, but, uh, but, uh... I don't kill...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. But the... I have asked this question to so many people, that "Why you are killing although it is prohibited, 'Thou shall not kill.'?" They cannot give me any satisfactory answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I think I've given you one. I'm just thinking in a way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Innocent animal killing and taking a potato from the tree, you are making equalized. It is not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, no, I'm not (indistinct) and saying. All I'm saying is if you're logical and accept different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is logical. Now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...kinds of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have to live. We agree that we have to live by eating another living entity. <span class="Italic">Jivo jīvasya jīvanam.</span> But if I eat this grass, taken some grass, and if I eat some animal, do you think they are equal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equal? Then why don't you kill your child, own child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Because there's a, I mean, a... That's, that's... Logical. I just tried to show you the difference between...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, we don't agree that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...vegetative life, sensitive life and rational life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ... that innocent... That... That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Rational? Animals have got rationality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No they haven't. <span class="Italic">Omnia animalia intelectu carent.</span>(?) (Latin)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Even your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> This is bringing out exactly...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Even your own psychologists will display to you rational life in the monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And so many other animals. Rats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> They make rational decisions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No they don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I mean it's been accepted. ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Your own psychologists will display that to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, all I can say is it's been accepted in the teaching of not many western philosophers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not eastern philosophers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> But all eastern philosophers... <span class="Italic">Omnia animalia intellectu carent.</span>(?) (Latin) And now, as Mrs. Christie just said, if you've done a bit of study...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So because, because some animal is not intelligent, you are right to kill?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, no, no. We're not talking about killing. He, his theme now, that there's no difference between us and the dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> You're more intelligent than a dog-to some degree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> So in other words, if we are, all of us here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even the animal is not intelligent, you cannot kill. Because your child is also not intelligent, so that does not mean you can kill your child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, but nobody, I'd, nobody'd, nobody'd, master, nobody'd for one second would think about killing a child.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That is not a very good reasoning, that because the animal is not intelligent, they may be killed. That is not very good reason.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, no, that isn't the reason. That isn't the reason why we kill it. We kill the animal because we need it for a means of living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> As food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You need it... Just like if you can get nice fruits, grains, milk, why do you need animal? You have to eat. You have to eat and live. Not to kill. Similarly, that if you can get nice foodstuff from food grains, from fruits, from flowers, from vegetables, from milk, why you should kill the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, a lot of people now are going over to health foods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> This is thought of by a lot of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, lot of people may do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I agree with you. Yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But a reasonable man, a religious man, he should have discrimination, that "If I get my foodstuff from here, why shall I kill a big animal?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, it's not... I always think it's not for me to condemn people, whatever they do. All I ask for in life is... I'm not condemning you, but uh...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are thinking in that way. It is all right that we have to eat some living entity, but a difference... If we can get... Besides that, when you get the grains, it is not actually killing. When you get the fruits, I am getting these fruits from the tree. It is not killing. The fruits are there. I take it. It falls down. I take it. The grains also. It is not killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I think... No, well, I don't think we're really worried about whether we kill or you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, if I take milk from the cows, that is also cow's blood, but I don't kill it. So if I can live in such nice way, without killing, I get the fruits and flowers and the milk and the grains, why should I kill the animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> There're a tremendous number of people being vegetarians today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You're not the only people. I mean, a lot of people just have, yes, they do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. That is nice, very nice. They should be vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...but we don't condemn people who do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will make them less sinful. And that will qualify them to go back to home, back to Godhead. If they remain sinful, they cannot go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Would you say that because we-and I talk about myself-because I have meat and bacon and so on, I am a, does that make me sinful? If I didn't eat those, I would be less sinful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> So if I give up eating meat and bacon and sausages and things, I'll suddenly become a different person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you become pure. You become pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> That's very interesting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I just met a gentleman who told me exactly that. Just a few min... He's a businessman here in London. He's about forty years old. And three months ago, he decided, because he learned, heard this from us, he decided to become a vegetarian. And a few weeks later, I talked to him. He said, "You know, it's amazing the difference in my consciousness." He says, "I have become a completely different man." Yeah, he told me that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, yes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And he's a very intelligent man. He's in the Mensa Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the Vedic literature it is said the animal killers cannot understand God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, this is very good, sir, that you find this, and I say, this is not my argument... Yes. Hmmm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not practical also. I have seen the animal killers. They do not understand what is God. That is a fact. Neither they have got brain to understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you don't need brain if you're not going to study or to do anything further. If you just sit and sleep like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are studying. Because we are preaching, we are studying that. The animal eaters, they cannot have any conception of God. The brain is so dull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> What about your children? Where do they? Do they go to school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Are they edu...? Do they go to schools, your children?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have now grown up. My grandsons are going to school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I didn't mean yours in particular. I'm talking now of all of you. I'm not talking of you particularly. I'm talking of all of you. All your children, the married devotees...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, our children, we have got our own school. All these boys, they have got their children. They are <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> householders. So we have got our nice school at Dallas, very big school.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you have got a school, a Kṛṣṇa school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> And now, how...? Do they go through college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are now little children. But we don't wish to send them to college. We have got sufficient books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> So you'll cut off their education like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this nonsense education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Now, do you think that's not cruel to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't care for this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> We cut off your education, and we take education from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and from our spiritual master. We learn how to read, how to write, how to handle numbers sufficiently, and whatever we need practically for our work. And we learn the science of God from our spiritual master. And we find that sufficient for us. We haven't got to spend extra time and many extra years irrelevant subjects that are never going to relate to our practical life or to our God conscious life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> But you're depending on other people, then, to do the other side of your life for you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not depending on anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, what happens when suddenly one of you gets, very ill tomorrow morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> What happens if somebody gets very ill tomorrow morning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we give them medicine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You call the doctor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, you call the doctor, don't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we pay for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I know, but you call him, don't you? You want him to be, you want the doctor in existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So does it mean to say that because we require necessary, we have to take education of medical man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you don't train people to be medical men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all, if we can get it easily...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our training is... First of all, try to understand. We... Just like you have got four divisions in the body for maintaining the body. So the head division, the arm division, the belly division, and the leg division. The leg is doing its own work, walking. The hand is doing its own work. And the belly's doing its own work. And the brain is doing own work. It does not mean that when the brain is work, it does not require the help of the leg. But a brain does not require to learn the business of the leg. This is the idea. The brain requires the help of the leg. But does not mean that brain has to learn how to walk also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I'm a nurse, and so that is why I would like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there must be division of work. So you take from... When there is necessity of brain work, you take help from him. And when there is need of the walking, take leg, help from the leg. It is a cooperation. Not that everyone has to learn everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. Well, as I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It does not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I myself did a training. I became a nurse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are asking us "Why you are not taking medical education?" Why we shall take?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Because if everybody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no necessity. If the... If I can pay, I can get the help of a medical man, why should I waste my time in that way? Let me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You think? Ah, but you should be self-supporting. You should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let me engage my time for understanding God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You should be self-supporting in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Self-supporting. We are self-supporting. Just like... I have given the example. The body, the social body... You can take of this body. There are four divisions: the head division, the arm division, the belly division, and the leg division. So belly is doing the work of the belly, stomach. The leg is walking. The hand is doing, defending, and the head and the brain is giving instruction to everyone. This is cooperation. So that is Vedic system of civilization. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> There must be divisions of work. Not that everyone has to learn everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, I don't mean that. You're misunderstanding me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. Then your question is replied. When I need the help of a medical man, I go to the medical man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, what I'm saying to you is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is the wrong? You find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...you can love God and be near God and train to be a medical man. Why don't you let some of your boys be trained to be medical men? Why do you say no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But again you are putting the same question. We are training them for the brain, and you are asking me that "Why don't you train them for the leg?" That is your question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But they can still love God. They can still work for God at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why you are asking this brain to learn how to walk? Why you are asking this odd question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, my brain works and I also, if there was a war tomorrow, I could go and be a nurse and look after the sick...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...and still be with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have already explained. There are four divisions. So one division can take help of the other division. That is another thing. But you are asking that, "You are simply interested in brain. Why not for the leg?" But we are interested. But not in that way. When we can see that I can pay for the medical man and I can get the help, why shall I waste my time to become a medical man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I think it's so sad to see a lot of very good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Just, just try to understand this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...young men becoming cabbages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're misunderstanding. Yes. When I can get... Just like here is father. He's trained up how to preach. He's not a medical man. But he doesn't require to learn the medical science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, but I didn't ask you to be a doctor. I said some of your boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why... Why you are asking? My boys are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Which ones? Which ones of us should become doctors here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, all, all, all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Supposing they all want to be preachers. Do you go to your seminaries and take one boy from each class to become a doctor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, well, if you had an epidemic of smallpox...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...or typhoid, you... You know what smallpox is like in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Presupposing. There must be division.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Do you go to your seminary and take one boy from each class to become a doctor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> It'd be no good at all being priest if you had smallpox, would it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So therefore you do that. You go to your seminary and take one boy from each class to be a doctor. By force. "Now, you come..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are treating them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> "...and be a doctor." They all want to be preachers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You've got to have balance, balance otherwise. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Balance, this is balance. Let us... You, you take some students and train them as medical man. But I am training to become preachers. Why you interfere with my business? You do your own business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, my son is my business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So your son, your son is not dependent on you. He's independent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, but he was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You want independence. He's already independent of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> He was snatched out of the university by your people going round the universities. He was in university.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But... That's all right. If some of our student goes to the university... There are many students...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Now wait a minute. We didn't snatch Michael.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't object to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Michael came to the temple in London, sat down, and didn't want to go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> He'd been taking LSD, and he was very sick. And somebody took him in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So,... So when he was taking LSD, what did you do for him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Why was he taking LSD? He had wonderful education, happy home, so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, he was experimenting. Now this is it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So LSD is acknowledged a dangerous thing to experiment with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You like that? You like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, he had a false... This was not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When he was taking LSD, did you like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I didn't know, did I?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Until afterwards, and we found him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> And this is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there must be division for upkeep of the soc... That is missing. At the present moment, there is no division.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But he had a false religious experience, due to the LSD.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I am talking generally, not of him, that everything must be, there must be division. Just like naturally we have got division. The whole object is to keep the body fit, but there is division: the head division, the arm division, the stomach division, and the leg division. So similarly, there must be four classes of men in the society: the intelligent class of men, the administrator class of men, the productive class of men, and the laborer class of men. Everything is required. But not that the intelligent class of man has to learn the business of the laborer class of men. That is not required. Just try to understand. The laborer class of men, they are required. But one who is intelligent class, he, he cannot be trained up as laborer, ordinary laborer in the factory. That is mistake. He must work according to his capacity. If he's intelligent, he must be preacher, he must be God conscious. He would educate people that "This eating, sleeping is not all. There is God. You should understand. You have got a relationship with Him. If you want to have better life next, then you must become God conscious, you must be sinless." These things are required in the society. (loud noise of jet going over). What is the use of talking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Father, I understand that you have translated ten books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now again. Again the same question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Is it not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I say that there must be divisions. We are working on certain division.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, tell me about the books you have translated. Are there some more to translate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, one day you will die. Now who will translate them then? Continue the translating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many. There are many. They are being trained up. There are many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Ah, yes. So people are being trained. Ah. This is what I'm asking you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, I explained that to you earlier, that we have our classes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are training every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But then, this is languages. You've got to, you've got to study languages. You can't just be taught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes. So a few of us, so the few of us who have an aptitude for Sanskrit language are studying Sanskrit language.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are teaching Sanskrit, we are teaching English. Especially. Especially we are giving training to our boys to learn simply English and Sanskrit. Then they will be help. By learning Sanskrit, they will be able to read...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Latin? And...? What...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no need of... One language sufficient. English language, practical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Ah, but then that is one-sided then, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Most of us don't even study Sanskrit very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like English book. We are translating in German, translating in France, in Spanish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But there's a lot of Latin that needs translating too. I mean, you must, you must, you must have a full understanding of everything if you're going to translate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It will be better. If you also join, then we'll have full understanding. (mother laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You have a sense of humor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> What language, master, was your books originally written in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Don't you find it extremely difficult to get the literal meaning from the Sanskrit to the English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You may, it may be difficult for you, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> No, no. I'm just thinking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...for one who knows Sanskrit, it is not difficult for him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> When I did my studies, we had to do Greek and Hebrew and Latin and, naturally, reading the scriptures in English. But it helped enormously with a background of a little bit of Hebrew. Not very much. But certainly Greek and Latin. You get a much more comprehensive notion of what's in the scriptures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we are teaching Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are teaching Sanskrit to our students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes, but all I was saying was, isn't it difficult to get across at times what you can see the meaning in the Sanskrit, but you can't put it into acceptable English? You know what I mean. The idiom isn't the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are giving every word, meaning. The book... Have you got any book? Bring it. You can see. Each and every word of Sanskrit we are giving meaning. Our mode of presentation is first of all we put the original Sanskrit language in <span class="Italic">devanāgarī</span> character. Then we give English, Roman transliteration, pronouncing the same word by diacritic mark. Then each word is translated into English. Then we give translation, the whole. And then we give the purport. This is our way. So we are giving meaning of each and every word means we have got considerable knowledge of that word. Otherwise how we can give? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I was just thinking how difficult it is. I read Latin pretty well. And Greek. And I can see the meaning in the original, in the Greek when it was translated from the Aramaic. Now in your translating you can get a phrase, and if you know the language, you know exactly what it conveys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Put it into English and somehow, some of the meaning has come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that exact...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> It's like the French. How do you say in..., how do you translate "au revoir"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> He's asking you how to translate a French word, "au revoir."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> How do you translate into English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I'm not translating. The person who knows French language, he translates from our English.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes. No, well, I'm only trying to... A very simple question. It's not a question of trying to try anybody. I happened to say or give an example of what I mean. How'd you say in English, "au revoir."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just... Just the... You have seen the... Just show him how it is done. Yes, you can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That's all right. Mahādeva, you do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see the original Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahādeva:</span> Here's the text, here's the original Sanskrit. And we have a Roman transliteration, and then individually, the word meanings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, I see. I've got it, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahādeva:</span> And then a full translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Translation. Yes. They're marvelous. Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Actually, most of the Sanskrit, much of that work is done by one of Prabhupāda's disciples now. He handles much of the Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are being trained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> It's a mechanical process, after all. But the translation, that requires not only knowledge of the language, it requires spiritual realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And the spiritual translation is done by Prabhupāda. Not just from knowledge of Sanskrit, but from spiritually realized knowledge. That is the qualification to put the meaning into any language. You have to have realized the message.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Oh, I agree. Certainly our, the great, in the western church, all the translations of the Gospels and the Old and New Testament is done by, for the most part, by men who were saints, and, in other words, it wasn't merely their knowledge of the language, but their incredible closeness to God, in everyone of them, Garems(?) and Augustine and all the great men...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> The most recent translation accepted by the Church of England, in England, was done by Oxford scholars. Saintly men? I know some of them. I don't think they're actually saintly men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, it's the modern... It's accepted by the Church of England and most other Protestant churches in England. It's the new English Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And it's recommended by all these churches for their followers to read. And it's translated by scholars, Oxford scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes. I see. I take your point, that you can have a translation which is purely academic and a translation which is not merely academic, but has a, sort of a spiritual experience behind it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Um-huh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> In fact, I can say, by... I'm a Catholic priest, and by and large, I think our men, who are to, doing the translations are pretty, like, good chaps anyhow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Hmh. So if, if the translators and the knowledge are adequate, then why is it, as Mrs. Christie just pointed out that so many young people are interested instead in false religious experience of LSD?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I wouldn't know. Because, I would say, because there's some kind of inadequacy in their lives. There's something missing, and that, the thing which is missing, is what we in the Catholic Church call the life of grace, the supernatural. Somehow, something's gone wrong somewhere. And so, they, lots of the young people today...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that I was trying to explain, that nobody can understand God and God's conception, being sinful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> There's a vacuum created, and so they'd rather take it up in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> It's very extraordinary, though, that every boy that I have spoken to here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam...</span> [Bg. 7.28].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> ...have all taken LSD or drugs of some kind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> That was one who hasn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Even your president...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I haven't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> I said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> This one, this one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> The ones I have spoken to. I said the ones I have spoken to. Even your president...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And Father Bernard? Father Bernard spent twenty-three years in a Cistercian monastery. He left and came to us right afterwards, and he's never taken LSD.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Who was in a Cistercian monastery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Father Bernard there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Are you a priest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But I say quite a lot of your young people have come to you since they took drugs. I've spoken to... Even your president admitted that he'd taken drugs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no restriction for anyone. God is open for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you said... Michael, I said, "Most of the people that I have spoken to." I didn't say "most of the people here." I said, "most of the people..." One person I'd spoken to hadn't, but I can truthfully say that only one hadn't, out of the ones I've spoken to. They have come here... You are... You seem to be able to help the people that have taken drugs so that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> You've helped them tremendously, and I can see this, but I am so sad that you can't help them to further their education. That's all my, my problem is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahādeva:</span> Prabhupāda was making the point that the purpose of education is to know God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, I know. I know. Yes, he has, and I've seen that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't you think this is education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This translator work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If we are teaching our boys...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But you know what I me...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Sanskrit and English to translate the original Vedic lit..., is it not education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, I agree with you. That is education. But I mean a fuller education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are trying to induce our students to become technologists, medical men. You want that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, because the world must have them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But our point is that if we can get the help of technologist by paying little money...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, you'd laugh if you were ill and there was no doctor, wouldn't you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...why should we waste our time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> If you had acute appendicitis, what would you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, you wouldn't. You'd die. I mean... You laugh when I say that. Somebody's got to be a doctor. You're being very childish. Father agrees. There must be doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, it's good that... In the society we observe there are many, many people becoming doctors. But there are not very many people becoming <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> people who live a sinless life and who learn the science of God and distribute it to the people. There're not very many people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I think that... I think that... (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Not very many, not very many people are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I don't know. I think that that's a gratuitous statement for which you can have no proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I'm just saying not many people are doing it. How many pe... How many people, compared to the number of medical students in England, how many people are students in religious seminaries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, do you know?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, I'm asking you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I do. I do. I do know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So give us a comparison.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes. Well, I... We've no problem at all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, another thing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> ...in finding plenty of young men to go along with the principles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Neither have we. And you're teaching them to preach God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> And Prabhupāda is teaching us to preach God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes. Well, I know... I've never questioned that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So there's no necessity, there's no necessity of canvassing amongst the seminaries or here for medical doctors.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> No, no. You've missed the whole point. Mrs. Christie's original statement was, if the young men here went on, not mer..., keep the knowledge and the search for the knowledge and love of God, by all means, but let them go on to develop their knowledge in the world of science, in the world of learning, and thus become leaders in that particular branch with a spiritual motif behind it, and instead of enclosing yourselves inside a circle like this, being able to spread the love of God amongst the tens of thousands of young people in the world. That's all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No. I, I suspect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> We need it. We need it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> I suspect that for the hundred, hundred or hundred and twenty of us in England, I think, for the number of us, I'll bet we're doing more work per man to spread it among the young people than your mission is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I wouldn't know. You're making this statement. I haven't proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, I know that in almost all of our centers they suddenly happen to be developing a temple like this. We spend every day, from ten o'clock in the morning until nine o'clock at night engaged in preaching work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I think most of us do, too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, in each of our centers we have got minimum fifty heads, maximum two hundred, 250. In Los Angeles, you see... Just we have got recent photograph. Bring the photograph from my room. You can bring. So we are giving them place, we are giving them food, we are giving them education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this way. So we invite anyone, everyone, without any distinction, without any discrimination. He may be Christian, he may be Hindu, he may be Mohammedan. "Come on. Live with us, and learn how to love." That is our mission. We say, according to our Vedic description,</div>
<div class="Verse">sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo<br class="calibre2"/>yato bhaktir adhokṣaje<br class="calibre2"/>ahaituky apratihatā<br class="calibre2"/>yayātmā suprasīdati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.2.6]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">If you actually want peace of your mind, then you must try, you must learn how to love God. So our preaching is... It doesn't matter, whatever religion you are following, it doesn't matter. If you have achieved this aim, how to love God, then your system is first-class. That's all. That is our question. <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmo yato bhaktir adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.2.6]<span class="Italic">. Bhakti,</span> means love of God. How much you have learned to love God, that much we want to know. We don't say that "You are Christian, you become followers of Hindu rituals or Mohammedan rituals." No. You remain in your position, but just try to love God to the best of your capacity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I think we do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> We're all doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Most people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is our mission. Now, if you find it difficulty, you can come and join with us. That's all. Practically, in Europe and America, they are all coming from Christian group, Jewish group. So... Yes. This is a recent photograph of our Los Angeles center. They are regularly living in the temple, as they are living in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you'll also be surprised to know that this, this was a church, that building. It was a big church. So we have purchased it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> In other words, your temple... Do you call it your temple or a church?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We call temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> A temple. And are these married and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there are married, there are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> there are <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> all kinds of people. It is not restricted. You see. So many children. They're having children. We are taking care of them. Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Now, do you have these temples in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Because I myself haven't been to India, but my parents were there. And the Indian contingent from Dunkirk was billeted in my home in 1940, just before my marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. There you see. Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> And we had all the Indians there after Dunkirk waiting for more Indians to come and join them. And we had the Hindus and the Mohammedans and the sweepers, and they all had their own houses. And they recovered from all the war damage, and they went off within about twelve months. They went off in '41, back to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was some bombing in Calcutta, nothing more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Hm. Ah, but these Indians were fighting in France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that is another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Dunkirk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dunkirk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> And then they came, when Dunkirk was evacuated, they came back in all these little boats that they escaped in, and they got together and they billeted them... And I was living with my godmother in Sholden (?) in Devonshire. And we had eight acres. And the Army put up huts for them. And they lived there for about eight months until more Indians were sent to make them back to strength again, the regiments, big enough. And then they went overseas again. Some went to Burma, some to Italy. I don't know where they went, of course, but they were very good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They went to die, after all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> They were very good soldiers. No, they didn't all die. Of course, some did, I expect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some, (laughs) yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> But they were, they were very fine men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, anyhow, thank you very much, father, for letting us talk and for letting us listen to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much for your coming here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Very nice to come here, and congratulations for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our only proposal is that you try to love God. That's all. God is one. God is neither Hindu, nor Muslim, nor Christian. God is God. So let us love God. That's all. That is perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, you can rest assured, we do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes, we do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> I wouldn't have given up my life to Him fifty-two years ago to be a Jesuit priest unless I loved God, would I?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Unless you love God, how you have become priest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> And I'm not only one, but there happen to be thirty-three thousand of us in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you have become a priest, that means you love God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Yes. Fifty-two years ago I made up my mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> How do you know I'm a grandmother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> No, he said <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Oh! I thought you said <span class="Italic">grandmother!</span> I am a <span class="Italic">grandmother.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, that's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Well, I think we'd better be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, thank you very much. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Give it in the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Take little <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Thank you. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Hare Kṛṣṇa. Jaya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Well, I think we understand each other a little better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you. Thank you. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are fortunate that you have got so nice son like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Good-bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Good-bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jesuit Priest:</span> Good-bye, thanks, good-bye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Good-bye, all of you. Bye. [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> ...question that she said, he came to us because he was taking LSD and he had a false religious experience. And the question is now, if they have access to a true religious experience, why was he looking for a false religious experience? Why was Michael looking for a false religious experience from LSD if he had already got true religion? They didn't understand. Their best children are taking LSD because they can't get any satisfaction from their parents' religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> He answered that by saying he didn't have that supernatural grace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yeah, why not? That's pretty clear, actually. "Well, we love God. Yes, we love God." A steak and a glass of wine and God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> I think a storm is coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śrutakīrti:</span> A rainstorm is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rainstorm? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Little, little... It might rain. It's not for a while. But when it gets misty, it sometimes rains.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can understand from the cloud. When it's blackish, then there is rain. [Break] (end)</div>
