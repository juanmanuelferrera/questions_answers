<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa. So how are we to understand the name of the spiritual master. In <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> when we chant the name of the spiritual master, is that as spiritually potent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You have to understand the position of Vaiṣṇava. Vaiṣṇava's position is far far greater than the demigods. Demigods, they shower flowers on the Vaiṣṇavas. So they are very exalted personalities, especially the spiritual master. There's no comparison of the spiritual master with any entities in the universe or <span class="Italic">brahmāṇḍa.</span> As Prabhupāda's purport has said many places: "The spiritual master is the external manifestation of the Supersoul, Paramātmā within your heart." Paramātmā is Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, and He becomes manifest before you in form of a guru or spiritual master. So you cannot compare a spiritual master or guru with any other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, his question is why the demigods... Just like Lord Brahmā, he is the original spiritual master. So why the demigods should not be equal to the spiritual master. That is his question. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They are not equal to the spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That is his question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> As you are explaining in your scriptures that the spiritual master is Paramātmā externally manifested but do not in case of other demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the spiritual master is given so exalted position than the demigods? That should be the answer. Demigods, they are also Vaiṣṇava, mostly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They are not pure devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are also devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> But their devotion is mixed devotion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like Lord Brahmā. We belong to the <span class="Italic">Brahmā-sampradāya.</span> Brahmā is the original spiritual master after Kṛṣṇa. Brahmā, then Nārada, then Vyāsadeva-like that. So all of them are gurus, <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> So why spiritual master is honored as good as the Supreme Lord? <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.</span> Why? That should be his question: Why spiritual master is given the supreme post than all others? <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena</span>-as good as God. Why? Is it not? It is clear, his question. First of all, is this his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Yes, this is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> The spiritual master is very much concerned about our personal welfare. They are the present <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> in the <span class="Italic">paramparā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He gives direct knowledge of Kṛṣṇa; therefore he's as good as Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I was just telling him to fan just when there's flies just to scatter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are tired now? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can climb on the tree? No. Let me see. (children laughing) It is better than that path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not so crowded. That path is very crowded. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> ...five thousand years back, until now, there's only thirty <span class="Italic">ācāryas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chain is broken when there are false spiritual masters. Otherwise it is not broken. Chain is broken if a so-called spiritual master speaks something manufactured. Then the chain is broken. Otherwise chain is not broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you could not. [break] <span class="Italic">Uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ kintu prabhor yaḥ priya eva tasya: **</span> "The spiritual master is as good as God because he's very dear to Kṛṣṇa." He's preaching Kṛṣṇa's mission, and Kṛṣṇa is very, very pleased with him. <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is spiritual master's qualification. He's trying his best to deliver the soul from these clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is a great service. Therefore he is very dear. One who is chanting or executing devotional service for his personal benefit and one who is trying to deliver others for others' benefit, there is difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Caraṇāravindam:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Isn't it the case that for some people then when the disciplic succession is lost, because if you're following a false guru... For example, your teachings now will always be on the planet. There will be other gurus who present some false teaching. So does that mean that for some people the disciplic succession is there and some people it's not there? If they're following a false guru does that mean they've lost the disciplic succession?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, there is a good boy. <span class="Italic">Nāma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kapila:</span> Kapila.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kapila. Oh, Kapiladeva. (end)</div>
