<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. So let us begin from the Eleventh so that word meaning they may understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mad anugrahāya paramaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>guhyam adhyātma-samjñitam<br class="calibre2"/>yat tvayoktaṁ vacas tena<br class="calibre2"/>moho 'yaṁ vigato mama<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 11.1]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now try to understand the word meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is in relation to the previous, this thing, that Tenth that He showed you all the <span class="Italic">vibhūtis</span> in various conditions of the creation, and by understanding the various <span class="Italic">vibhūtis,</span> Arjuna said that "I have practically got disillusioned by this explanation." That is what he said. Is it all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now it is clear. Any question on this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All right. Shall I go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. So what is the translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> "Arjuna said: I have heard Your instruction on confidential spiritual matters, which You have so kindly delivered unto me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There you see here the last, last... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...means, now we have discussed Tenth [break], what is the confidential?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> About Kṛṣṇa Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is the confidential. <span class="Italic">Viṣṭabhyāham idaṁ kṛtsnam ekāṁśena sthito jagat [Bg. 10.42].</span> That is the most confidential. "Only by one of My this thing, the whole <span class="Italic">jagat</span> is being supported. Why do you want to talk about nonsense of so many things? Only one thing is important and that is this."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... Yes. So unless one is convinced that Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of all causes, <span class="Italic">sarva kāraṇa-kāraṇam</span> <span class="Italic">[Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">,</span> he has not understood the confidential subject matter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is the con... <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless one comes to this conclusion, that "Kṛṣṇa is the origin of everything," <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate, iti matvā bhajante mām,</span> he cannot be fixed up in the worship or serving Kṛṣṇa. This conclusion must be reached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The next word is telling the same thing as you say.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhavāpyayau hi bhūtānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śrutau vistaraśo mayā<br class="calibre2"/>tvattaḥ kamala-patrākṣa<br class="calibre2"/>māhātmyam api cāvyayam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 11.2]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">That "Everything is originating from You and..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the opposite. This is the conclusion, that one has to understand that Kṛṣṇa is the cause of all causes, He is the origin of everything. So why do they divert their attention to other subjects?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because of the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And what is that <span class="Italic">māyā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That Kṛṣṇa is... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Kṛṣṇa is an ordinary human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> They think that "Kṛṣṇa's body is just like mine."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Māyāvāda. This has been explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that <span class="Italic">matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. It was in me. Any of your ideas, it is, other than Kṛṣṇa, is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Please let me explain. <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe.</span> No, just explain. <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā. Parataḥ</span> means "from other sources." Just like I am explaining. That is <span class="Italic">parataḥ.</span> And <span class="Italic">svato</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Means Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will explain everything. <span class="Italic">Svato</span> means personally, <span class="Italic">sva. Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato vā mitho 'bhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām.</span> Or <span class="Italic">mithaḥ.</span> There are three sources of understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is that <span class="Italic">mithaḥ?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mithaḥ</span> means just like we are studying altogether. <span class="Italic">Mithaḥ</span> means in congregation. <span class="Italic">Abhipadyeta gṛha-vratānām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Of the embodied people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. <span class="Italic">Gṛha-vratānām</span> means those who are attracted to this... <span class="Italic">Gṛha</span> means this worldly family life. <span class="Italic">Gṛha-vrata. Gṛha. Gṛha-vrata.</span> So those who have decided that "We shall remain in this <span class="Italic">gṛha,</span> for them, either personally or from others or by conference, the <span class="Italic">matir na kṛṣṇe."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They do not have that mind fixed on Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they cannot. Why they cannot? <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamiśram [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> This <span class="Italic">gṛha-vrata</span> means their sense enjoyment. This <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life is a concession for sense gratification, license. Actually, it is not required. Sex life is not required. But those who cannot avoid the sex life, they are given some license, "All right, you enjoy sex life, marry one woman, remain as faithful husband and wife." So unless one determines that "This is not my life, <span class="Italic">gṛha-vrata..." Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> In another place it is said also, by Sukadeva Gosvāmī, one who cannot understand what is his self-interest, <span class="Italic">apaśyatām ātma-tattvam,</span> actually what is needed, what is the need of the soul, <span class="Italic">gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām...</span> The <span class="Italic">gṛha-vrata</span> and <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhi,</span> these two words are for persons who are too much attached to this worldly life. So this determination already is there, that "Kṛṣṇa is the original cause of everything." <span class="Italic">Iti matvā bhajante mām.</span> One who understands this perfectly well, he can be engaged in the matter of rendering service to Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise it is very difficult. <span class="Italic">Matir na kṛṣṇe parataḥ svato va.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Swami Nārāyaṇa has answered in this way, that any of your <span class="Italic">matir...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Swami Nārāyaṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, I speak. Any <span class="Italic">buddhi</span> other than giving Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Anything you think other than Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then when he thinks that "I am incarnation of Kṛṣṇa,"...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has not said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...it is not <span class="Italic">māyā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He had not said so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If tomorrow these boys say that you are incarnation of God, is it your fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is what it is. Tomorrow these boys say, after you pass away, that you are incarnation of God. It is not your fault. Like that, people will say so. I have not said so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is going on. The other day one, another Swami Nārāyaṇa came. I ask him "Why there is no picture of Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That we will discuss after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He also said like that. "No, because..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Why do you want to divert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You diverted. You brought Swami Nārāyaṇa. We don't accept Swami Nārāyaṇa as authority. We don't accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> Let us hear the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> Then what happens further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I read further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">He wants to see His real form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, that is not real form. Real form is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Aiśvaram rūpam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a form for less intelligent. Those who are thinking "The God must be horizontal form. God, how He can be a human-like form?" God is great, so he is thinking of greatness of God. Somebody thinks that, according to his own idea. Greatness means they have got idea, "The sky is the greatest." So God must be of the form like sky. Yes. So what is the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms) "Translation: O lotus-eyed one, I have heard from You in detail about the appearance and disappearance of every living entity, as realized through Your inexhaustible glories." (reads next synonyms) "O greatest of all personalities, O supreme form, though I see here before me Your actual position, yet I wish to see how You have entered into this cosmic manifestation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Entered. So just like it is to be understood. He's very intelligent. Now, I am... As soul, my magnitude is described. What is that? <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">. Keśa agra,</span> the tip of the hair, divide into hundred parts. And again take that one part and again divide into hundred parts. <span class="Italic">Keśāgra-śata-bhāgasya śatadhā kalpitasya ca</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.140]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now, it is simply, it is to be imagined. <span class="Italic">Kalpitasya. Jīva-bhāgaḥ sa vijñeyaḥ.</span> That is the magnitude of the <span class="Italic">jīva.</span> Now, that magnitude of <span class="Italic">jīva</span> has entered in this body or in the elephant's body. Now, which is important, the body is important or that small particle is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Small particle is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Therefore those who are materialistic persons, they are amazed with the huge body of this universe. But Arjuna is saying that "On account of Your entering..." As this body has developed on account of entering, that minute particle or spiritual spark, similarly, there are innumerable universes. All these universes, they have developed. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...Kṛṣṇa's entering as Garbhodakaśayī Viṣṇu. That is explained in the last chapter.</div>
<div class="Verse">athavā bahunaitena<br class="calibre2"/>kim jñātena tavārjuna<br class="calibre2"/>vistabhyāham idaṁ kṛstnam<br class="calibre2"/>ekāṁśena sthito jagat<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. 10.42]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">By His one plenary portion, by entering into this material world, so gigantic form is there. Therefore they cannot understand that how Kṛṣṇa, just like a human being, he can be more important than this gigantic cosmic manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I read further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">manyase yadi tac chakyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>mayā draṣṭum iti prabho<br class="calibre2"/>yogeśvara tato me tvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>darśayātmānam avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [BG. 11.4]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">darśayam, darśaya.</span> "Now, how You have, I mean to say, manifested yourself in this cosmic, gigantic cosmic manifestation?" So if it is possible, kindly... So the point is: this gigantic cosmic manifestation is dependent on Kṛṣṇa, not that Kṛṣṇa is one of the product of this gigantic manifestation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms) (Prabhupāda interrupts)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here Kṛṣṇa is addressed, "Yogeśvara," because the yogic power, that is estimated very much important by the ordinary class of men. So He is the master of all yogic power. Just like here, that gold maker?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Sai Baba?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sai Baba. He is showing little yogic <span class="Italic">aiśvarya.</span> But people are, because they do not know, they are not aware of Kṛṣṇa, they are taking him as God. You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads rest of synonyms for this verse) "Translation: If you think that I am able to behold Your cosmic form, O my Lord, O master of all mystic power, then kindly show me that universal self."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, here is the description of how God manifests. So unless one reads <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> carefully, they will be misled by this <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> that <span class="Italic">avatāra,</span> that <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> You see?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is another instruction. That I explained, that before accepting a so-called incarnation of God, one should ask him to show that "How you are God?" But they do not ask him. A group of persons... Because he is accepted by a group of persons, not by all... There are so many <span class="Italic">avatāras.</span> But who knows them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us understand it. Don't be anxious to go forward. This is the..., that... Suppose a man declares himself that "I am <span class="Italic">avatāra."</span> So intelligent man should test him, how he is <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> We accept Kṛṣṇa or Lord Rāmacandra for their uncommon activities. But what is the uncommon activities, so many <span class="Italic">avatāras?</span> Simply being praised by a group of persons. That's all. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Paśyādityān vasūn rudrān aśvinau marutas tathā [BG. 11.6].</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, first of all, he's saying that <span class="Italic">paśyādityān. Ādityān,</span> plural number. Not only one, plural number. <span class="Italic">Ādityān</span> means the Sūrya...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sūrya and all those twelve sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, <span class="Italic">ādityān.</span> So here they cannot estimate the influence of one Āditya, and here he is showing all the Ādityas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Within Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Within Him. That is Yogeśvara.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Even which Arjuna did not hear before, that was also shown. What was heard by him formerly, that was also shown and unheard of, unseen, that was also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads rest of synonyms) "Translation: O best of the Bhāratas, see here the different manifestations of Ādityas, Rudras and all the demigods. Behold the many things which no one has ever seen or heard before."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is, this is...

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They don't believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Even they are now trying to find out stars further and further with a bigger and bigger...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot see even one universe, and here it is said that "All the universes, innumerable universes." So what these...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Their reaction is: "Simply because it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> does not mean it actually happened." They don't think it happened just because it is written here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, happened or not happened. But you have no estimation, even one universe. You cannot say like that because you are a fool still. Even though it did not happen in the body of Kṛṣṇa, but you have no estimation, you cannot know what is the sun-god or sun planet or moon planet. You cannot go there. So what is the value of your knowledge? If the statement of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has no meaning, then what is the meaning of your scientific knowledge? You are not perfect. So how you can say? Because you are imperfect, so you cannot say against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which is accepted by all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya... Don't be in hurry. Just finish one word. That is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without understanding, if you follow like a storm, that is no use. That is no use. Slow, but sure. Go slow... And that is the defect in the modern. If somebody can recite <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> like storm, it is to be understood he has perfected himself. No. Let him explain at least one word of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is wanted. Slow, but sure. That is going on. The professional <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> reciters, they jump over Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā.</span> The rascal does not explain the first line of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> It requires many years to understand that one word, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> and he jumps over, <span class="Italic">"Bhāgavata</span> recitation means <span class="Italic">rāsa-līlā.</span>" That is going on. That has spoiled the whole atmosphere. Therefore that rascal has been able to challenge that Kṛṣṇa, that, what is that, rural?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> "Popular rural god with sixteen thousand wives."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. He does not know what is Kṛṣṇa. And he is writing about Kṛṣṇa, "rural boy with sixteen thousand..." First of all, he does not know that when Kṛṣṇa was rural boy in Vṛndāvana he had no sixteen thousand wives. You see. Still, these rascals say, "rural boy with sixteen thousand wives."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> When He had this <span class="Italic">rāsa</span> dance, he was only seven years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, apart from that, actually, He had sixteen thousand wives when He was in Dvaraka, but these rascals say, "Rural boy." "Rural boy" means when He was in Vṛndāvana. So he does not know even the history, and he is trying to write about Kṛṣṇa. This is going on. And that is the proof. Kṛṣṇa had sixteen thousand wives. That is the proof that He is God, because you cannot maintain even one wife at the present moment. So He maintained sixteen thousand wives. That is the proof that He is God. That is the proof. But they will not take that side. They will take in other way, "Oh, this is all stories and fictitious." That's all. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know. They do not know what is Kṛṣṇa, and they try to write upon Kṛṣṇa, to imitate Kṛṣṇa. "Kṛṣṇa was an <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> Therefore I am also <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span>" These things are not very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> (reads synonyms) "Translation: Whatever you wish to see can be seen all at once in this body. This universal form can show you all that you now desire, as well as whatever you may desire in the future. Everything is here completely."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> So nobody can compare. In the Vedic literature it is said, <span class="Italic">na tasya kāryaṁ kāraṇaṁ ca vidyate na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate.</span> Nobody can be equal to Him. <span class="Italic">Sama, sama</span> means equal. <span class="Italic">Na tat-samaś cābhyadhikaś ca dṛśyate:</span> "Nobody is greater than Him, nobody is equal to Him." That is Kṛṣṇa. So as soon as one claims that "I am also Kṛṣṇa," he is a bogus immediately.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unlimited mouths. The unlimited person. As soon as you say, "unlimited mouths," means unlimited person. That is not imperson. Even in His <span class="Italic">aneka-mūrti</span> He is person. That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the Second Chapter, that all we remained person in the past, we are persons at present, and we shall continue to become persons in the future. So this impersonal description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is for the persons who do not understand what is God.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, everything is being described as person. So where is the question of imperson? Even in His <span class="Italic">aneka mūrti,</span> in the <span class="Italic">virāṭ</span> form, universal form, there are persons. At least from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> nobody can prove that the Absolute Truth, God, is imperson. That is not possible. But still, they are doing that. That means they do not understand what is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> although they are very much proud of regular scholar of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So am I right or wrong? Let us discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Chandobhai:</span> He is both personal and impersonal.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That imperson does not mean that He is not spiritually person. Impersonal means He does not become... That... This description of person, they are not these material persons.</div>
