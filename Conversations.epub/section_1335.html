<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...book sales and sells twelve to fifteen thousand rupees a month. It's very nice to see these foreign people coming to Vṛndāvana, having read your books, coming here. It's like a perfect fulfillment of your books. They're so much impressed with the subject matter that they want to see this Vṛndāvana. Especially they have read <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book. To them Vṛndāvana is like a magical world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hindi book is selling nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm-hm. He said so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four hundred, five hundred-no joke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no joke. That Bengali <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> is very good also. This one has come out very nice, the layout and everything. It's very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He writes nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhakti-caru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who has written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who wrote those articles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Bhakti-caru and... Bhakti-caru, Sarvabhāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sarvabhāvana and Bhakti-caru. Bhakti-caru is very literary, poetic type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Viśāla said... I was asking him last night. He said that the most difficult people for selling books to are the Bengalis when they come. They're the most difficult. But everyone else, they are more receptive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span> is taken, everyone who comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That <span class="Italic">bābājī</span> was telling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, Bābājī, Kṛṣṇa dāsa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that "In everyone's hand I see <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span>."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. (laughs) That's true. They take <span class="Italic">Gītār Gān</span> and a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> And they're anxious for the next issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have already published twenty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Twenty thousand. Very good sale. Good scope in Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Everywhere. Two hundred men already subscribed. If we increase subscribers, many, many...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You like that idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> When the boys are going village to village, if they get subscriptions, it's good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. That's a nice program. Anybody can afford it. What is a yearly subscription to the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata Darśana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Only one problem with <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> subscription is theft in the mail. It's very difficult to get it, for it to reach its destination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they make contact. For twelve rupees they'll get twelve copies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> When they contact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That's good idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mean they have to come and collect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. They come to the temple few times a year, once a year. They'll get their copies and go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then you have to keep them set aside with the person's name on it? That's not so hard. Just stick the person's name on it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Or if someone's going on traveling <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> in that area, 'cause we always know where they're going, they can take and deliver if they're going near. No problem. But the magazine is so attractive that the postal clerks, they cannot resist taking it home to their family. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get advertisement. But we don't want it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think.... It diminishes the prestige of the publication. By Kṛṣṇa's grace we have no shortage of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Have it. So we shall construct a Yoga-pīṭha Bhaktivedanta Hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Yoga-pīṭha Bhaktivedanta Hall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And we have a bookstall there. Make it like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For the last fifty years they could not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Make.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the idea of that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no shade. What is called? <span class="Italic">Darśana-maṇḍapa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> At the <span class="Italic">yoga-pīṭh</span>a<span class="Italic">...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At <span class="Italic">yoga-pīṭha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> ...when people come for <span class="Italic">darśana</span> there's no covered area for them. They've been trying to construct for years and years. They've never been able to do. So you have to stand out. If it's raining, what do you do? There's no shelter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, that's right. There's nothing there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And Śrīdhara Mahārāja could not finish. He has spent five, ten thousand, I think. Finished. In this way we shall serve Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhū... And the interest will come to charity. What is the interest of ten and a half <span class="Italic">lakhs?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's, every month... One of the... One of the interests for the five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> is 4,166 rupees, and the other is 4,666. So that's 8,800 say, times ten is 88,800, plus another sixteen. So about one <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> five thousand per year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means twelve thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Per month you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, per month, it would be about nine thousand rupees a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, Śrīla Prabhupāda. One <span class="Italic">lakh,</span> five thousand, divided by twelve-a little less than ten thousand a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can pay that ten thousand month? Huh? Bhavānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it very conscientiously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We'll begin with... We'll already have one <span class="Italic">lakh.</span> So the first year we've already got, to begin with, one <span class="Italic">lakh</span> of rupees. If you like that idea, to begin with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Whenever there is money, spend it. Is that idea all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Yes. I always am for spending money for projects for Your Divine Grace. I especially like this idea of Yoga-pīṭha Bhaktivedanta Hall. Very nice. Isn't it, Tamāla?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. Yes. It's very nice idea because people come to Māyāpura, they don't only go to our ISKCON temple. Even when they go to other temples, they should have a good impression of Caitanya Mahāprabhu's movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā:</span> "Life, money, intelligence, and words." So I am old man. My life has no value. You young men, utilize your...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We may have life, but you have all intelligence, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So life without intelligence...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone has got intelligence-more or less, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, you have complete, and we have practically none.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We have no spiritual intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Complete knowledge-Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samagrasya.</span> Complete knowledge can be claimed by Kṛṣṇa, even not by Nārāyaṇa. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Everything is coming. <span class="Italic">Vedāham.</span> What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Vedahaṁ sarvāṇi māṁ ca veda na kaścana? </span>The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> went to Pagal Baba? He has praised me very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Really? Hm. I think everyone praises you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very difficult. You have all taken meals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. While we were taking, we were thinking that you were seeing us, and we were satisfied. We were thinking that the spiritual master is very much satisfied when he sees his disciples respecting <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-prasādam.</span> [break] ...pray, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that you recover. You won't have to be bothered now by any more worries of any kind. You simply can translate and see all of the temples and the devotees. It will be very nice. You've never in all these years been able to be free of the worries and anxieties, but now you'll be able to be. Kṛṣṇa may grant you some more years so you can just have nice time with all of your disciples, visiting all the Deities. Like to take a little rest now, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What can I do? (laughs) (scratching sound) Whose hand it is? Whose hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Śatadhanya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śatadhanya:</span> Is it cold, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Make them warm. Make your hand warm by the stove.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody's hand is warm, I want. Whose hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Tamāla Kṛṣṇa. Better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is <span class="Italic">podda?</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your sister. I'm just calling right now. [break] (long pause-Śrīla Prabhupāda is sleeping) ...of the different businesses of Vrindavan? Well, first of all he was getting money for traveling expenses. So I have written a letter to Mr. Bekkar, the manager of the Central Bank of India at Camac Street, informing him that henceforward the interest from the fixed deposits in the name of BBT should be stopped from giving it to Vrinda Book Company, and instead the money should be transferred by mail transfer to the Central Bank of India, Gwalior Tank Road, to BBT account. I gave all the details. That's one letter. Then furthermore, I also addressed a letter to the Punjab National Bank, Brabourn Road, informing them that the Rs. 500 should be stopped from being given to Shrimati Radharani De, because... I didn't mention this, but the reason is that she'll be getting one thousand rupees from Indian Overseas Bank. And I'm sending that letter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh... Has Indian Overseas arranged?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Let me explain what I was going to say. The letter to Punjab Bank I have not sent to the bank. Rather, I have sent it to Girirāja and informed him that when the Indian Overseas Bank sends their first transfer of Rs. 1000, then he may send the letter to Punjab Bank regarding Radharani De. In other words, when we first get it confirmed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not Punjab National Bank, as they are sending, let them send and ask Overseas five hundred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, because we've already given them a scheme which accounts for everybody. Better to have the whole thing done in a very organized way from one bank, rather than a little here, a little from there. That is simply confusing. Besides that, the... It's just a lot simpler, you know, if we do it this way. That is my opinion, because we've already given a scheme to Indian Overseas. We've put fixed deposits worth a certain amount which bring one thousand rupees interest. So now, if we have to tell them a whole new scheme, then it becomes confusion. It's easier simply to inform the Punjab Bank to discontinue sending the five hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And unless they send, Overseas...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. I am not sending a letter to Punjab Bank. The letter is being sent to Girirāja with the clear instruction on cover letter, "Only send this letter to Punjab Bank after you have it confirmed that they have begun to dispatch Rs. 1000 per month." The same way we did for Sulakshman De. When we stopped sending it from here and we began sending from Bombay, we only told them to stop when it had begun to be sent from another bank. In other words, she'll get the money first from Indian Overseas before the other payment's stopped.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how she will get?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rs. 1000 per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A transfer from Indian Overseas Bank to her account in Bank of..., I think it's in United Bank of India, direct into her account. Her account is joint signature of herself and Vrindavan-candra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So she is informed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes. All of them are informed. Then I've also sent a letter to the Central Bank of India-again I'm not sending it to Central Bank; I've given it to Girirāja-that when they start to get the 250 rupees a month from Indian Overseas, then we will stop sending the 250 from Central Bank of India. In other words, everything will be done from one bank, right on our land. It's a lot easier to deal with this way. It's much cleaner. Then... Let me see what else. I also sent a letter to M.M. De today. I requested him to please tell me what his bank account number is. I also... He's dealing with most of the business of Panchashil flat. According to Vrindavan-candra, M.M. deals with these matters. Apparently he has a little more legal mind. Probably he's more intelligent. Anyway...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> M.M. De. So in my letter to him I explained to him... I enclosed a copy of the conveyance draft, and I requested him that as far as I was concerned, the draft was all right, but that he should check up with some of the other flat owners. If they executed a similar conveyance, please inform me, and then we will do as they have done. I also told him that whatever taxes or other things which he pays should be paid in your name, and receipts should be gotten in your name, and copies of the receipts he can please send me for my records. And I also wrote to him that regarding the permanent electricity supply, if the four of them together pay half of the amount, then as soon as they send me the receipt, then I will send a check for the other half. Those were the points I wrote in the letter to him. What I'm going to do is, as soon as I get this amendment done which mentions about the misspending, not to misspend the money-squandering clause-then I will send a copy of that along with a letter, explaining to them how each one of them will be getting Rs. 250, and then after seven years, you know, the bigger amount. And then I will send them a copy of that squandering clause with that, saying, "But you should not squander this money. It must be invested in fixed deposits or government bonds. Otherwise your monthly pension will be stopped and it will be given to Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity." I'm only going to do that after I get the amendment clause finished. So like that, everything was done, and I finished all of that business today. Also I wrote a letter to Dr. Ghosh, telling him that whatever money he advances we will match, again repeating our offer that we have two rooms ready. And I also mentioned to him how... He mentioned how he was a little disappointed with his discussions. I said that is not so surprising, because our Gurukula is ultimately meant for spiritual education, not otherwise, and we're only going to give a little basic hygiene teaching. I said, "Mainly now you should take up this dispensary. We are very eager for that." And again I invited him to come here soon. And I gave him a report of your health. And I also sent a letter to Bank of America in Los Angeles for transferring six hundred dollars to Prabhaviṣṇu in Nepal, because each month we have to give him that money so he can stay there and work there nicely. And then I did some other letters to Punjab Bank in Delhi to the head office, telling them that the interest... For now the interest from those fixed deposits we'll have credited to your account here. And once we have the first meeting of the Bhaktivedanta Charity Trust..., Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust, we'll open a bank account, probably in Māyāpura or Swarup Ganj.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not open the Charity Trust account in Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I would think that for operating it, it would be a lot more... My idea was that it would be better to have it in the Māyāpura area itself, since it is primarily meant for spending... It is meant entirely for spending in Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. My idea is that we would open the account in Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi area and give instruction to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gaura (indistinct) area where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, right now our bank accounts are in Swarup Ganj, Bhavānanda Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> We have in Swarup Ganj and Navadvīpa and Krishnanagar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I felt we would open it in either Swarup Ganj or Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Navadvīpa is good banks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Navadvīpa. And give the standing instruction at that time to Parliament Street bank to transfer every month the interest. That was my idea. But for the time being we have to tell them what to do with the interest. So I thought instead of going to the botheration of opening new accounts at the Punjab Bank at Parliament Street, let them go on transferring it to your accounts here. And then, when we open the Charity Trust account, then I'll give them a fresh instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What...? The... In the Punjab National Bank, fixed deposits in the name of?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fixed deposits are in the name of... Five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> are in the name of Kṛṣṇa-Balarāma Temple Maintenance account, and five <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> sixty thousand in the name of Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Trust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So where they will kept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The interest or the fixed deposits? The fixed deposits are in Delhi, and the interest, for now, for the next few months, I am instructing the bank to continue to transfer to the accounts here in Vṛndāvana that it's always been given to. Then when the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust account is opened, I will issue a fresh instruction to the Parliament Street bank that the interest money should be transferred to that account in Navadvīpa or wherever we open the account. My idea was simply that since the money is to be spent in Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi, then when we write checks out, etcetera, from that account, it's much easier to encash it rather than having to go to Delhi for encashment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi? Whenever needed...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, you said that the purpose of the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust was for development of Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. That was your original... At least that's what you initially told us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Which is better? Which is better?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That it should be just for Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi or general?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I think it's better for Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi. Because for general, we have ISKCON. For general, we have the... I'll explain, Śrīla Prabhupāda. For general, the GBC has formed the Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Committee. That is more or less... Your original name of it was Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Trust. So we've formed a Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Committee made up of the following seven people: Jayapatākā Mahārāja, Gopāla Kṛṣṇa Prabhu, Girirāja, myself, Rāmeśvara, and Gurukṛpā Mahārāja and Ātreya Ṛṣi. so these seven meet, and they divide up the money that comes from all the interest of the fixed deposits in India, and they will recommend how that money should be spent. Once a year they will consider at Māyāpura all the different requests from Bhuvaneśvara, from Māyāpura, from Bombay, from Vṛndāvana, everywhere, and they will divide up the interest accordingly. So the Bhaktivedanta Charity Trust could be simply for the Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi area. That was my idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whichever suitable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is suitable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I think the general is already covered by this Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Trust committee. That's for all of India. And Gauḍa-maṇḍala-bhūmi is especially for encouraging the development of Gauḍīya Vaiṣṇavism in that area-Śrīdhara Mahārāja's <span class="Italic">nātha-mandira,</span> this Yoga-pīṭha Bhaktivedanta Hall. Different buildings. Supposing one of your Godbrothers may have written some manuscript, he has no money. We can print some books for him so he can sell them, like that, works within the Māyāpura area.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall fix up, what to spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity trustees would fix that up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know if I'm understanding your desires about all of these points.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. My point is that all this interest will go for charity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "All of the interest" means from all of the different fixed deposits or from these ten <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> sixty thousand? Just like we have... I'll give you an example. In Bombay we have that Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Trust fixed deposits in Bank of America. So those are big amount. So those fixed deposits and other fixed deposits, that money, I was thinking, would be decided by that Māyāpura-Vṛndāvana Trust committee. Because those are all ISKCON men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Madhusūdana Mahārāja, Mādhava Mahārāja, they may decide for the Bhaktivedanta Swami Charity Trust with the other five of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that all right, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think your <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is here, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How do you feel that this <span class="Italic">kavirāja's</span> medicine is affecting, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Can you feel a change or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yesterday I felt some. But this massage is always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Massage is always welcome. Perhaps this might be a nice time to call Jayādvaita and Pradyumna. Do you feel like speaking and hearing about <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have no objection if they come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I'll arrange for them to come, Śrīla Prabhupāda. We haven't heard from Tenth Canto in a few days. That would be nice, I think. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> ...sent me an urgent telegram asking me to send the book manuscript and also to pick up another manuscript that he'd sent. So I went for... He told me to go for three days and not to come back to Vṛndāvana until it was done. But I went for one day. But I heard that I inconvenienced you because you couldn't translate that night. I'm sorry that I held up the work. That anthology book of different articles written by Your Divine Grace, I think that will come out very nicely. That's what Rāmeśvara was having me send him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anthology?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> It's a collection-Rāmeśvara mentioned it while you were here, while he was here-a collection of different articles from <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> written by yourself. There's your conversation with Professor Kotovsky, and also from the old BTG you were publishing in India there's that article "Relevant Inquiries." That's very wonderful article. Your correspondence with Dr. Stahl, that's also there. And lectures from different places. When you first arrived in London there's a very wonderful lecture. So many wonderful articles that have been published over the years in BTG. But the real thing is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his foolishness. Therefore Kṛṣṇa instructs, but he does not take. He wants to remain in <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and at the same time claim that he is liberated.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not real in this sense: because the spirit is there, therefore it is there. Because there is consciousness, there is ignorance, covering. And if you stop this ignorance, then consciousness is there, pure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> When the consciousness is undeveloped, looks like dead body.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> No, no. I had a talk with him. He's not really depending on him. I asked him. He said that it's always better to train up..., to have someone around who's seeing how he is treating.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I know what he's going to explain. He can't explain anything except that he wants to leave this boy in his place. That's the real point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I'm saying that the real point is that we don't want this boy to take the place of this <span class="Italic">kavirāja,</span> which is what the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is planning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, right. But the thing is that <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> can't stay for more than five days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's all right, but this is the point, that this boy is not a replacement for this <span class="Italic">kavirāja.</span> The fact is that Prabhupāda's condition being the way it is, we can't depend on the fact that Prabhupāda will continue to get exactly better as the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> plans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Then what do you think the alternative should be?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The alternative is that either the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> should stay here, or if we feel this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is actually giving beneficial help, then we should go with him. But I don't think that we should put ourselves in the hands of this junior man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is right conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> None of us... As soon as we saw him, we didn't even like his looks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> But the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> doesn't want that Prabhupāda should move.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then he should stay here if he doesn't want it. What will you do if, supposing after three days after the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> leaves, suddenly Prabhupāda's condition changes in such a way that it wasn't counted on. Then what will be done at that time? Then it means that this junior man suddenly has to give diagnosis and treatment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> That's the best. I mean if he stays here, then there is nothing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If he can't stay here, then he should help to take Prabhupāda to Māyāpura. And actually that will make him very responsible, because then he'll see that Prabhupāda is taking risk simply to be under his care. So that will make him feel even more obligated to take proper care of Śrīla Prabhupāda even after going to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the right conclusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) He does not agree. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Agree to remain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. He... He'll either agree to remain or else we'll make him agree to take you to Māyāpura. Probably by our refusing to accept this assistant, it will induce him to stay here a little bit longer to prepare you for the journey, and then he'll take you to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Journey, what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't find any difficulty. I didn't find any difficulty one week ago. I'm prepared to take you anywhere in the world, in any condition. I don't think that there's so much difficulty. I see how we're putting you on the palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhavānanda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> I also agree with Tamāla, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It will take three hours to the Delhi airport. Then it will take..., say, three hours, then one hour before take-off is four hours. Two hours on the flight is six hours, and three hours to Māyāpura, total...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> No. Four hours to Māyāpura, 'cause we'll go slow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, within ten hours from this bed to your bed in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maximum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How ten hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Three hours from here to the Delhi airport. One hour at the Delhi airport makes four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are going to Delhi airport in three hours. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then one hour waiting for the plane to take off. That's four hours. Two hours for the plane. That's six hours. And three to four hours to go to Māyāpura. Three hours to go to Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It always takes four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (to Bhavānanda:) But that's four hours from the Calcutta temple, not from Dum Dum. No, I'm telling you, you don't have to go through Calcutta at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> It only takes half an hour to get to the airport, and we'll go slow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then four hours from the Calcutta airport to Māyāpura. Total of ten hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Four hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I'm arguing this point with Bhavānanda Mahārāja, but he insists that he knows, so I'm accepting his statement. Three to four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Because the road is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes, it's not so good now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> So if you go too fast, then it's too bumpy. If you go slow, then it's reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let us go. And keep me in the open air. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The main thing is that we must present it to the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> that we are depending on his care. If you actually feel this <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> to be good and helpful, then we must present it in such a way that "We fully depend upon your treatment. Therefore, as you... We cannot depend on any junior man, because there may be complications at any time. Therefore, when you feel Prabhupāda is ready, you take us to Māyāpura. And if your other business in Calcutta is so pressing, then take us now." And in that way he'll be forced to feel responsible, because he'll see that we are going on his account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Talk like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I won't be able to... I'll talk, but they'll have to translate. Bhakti-caru has to translate. Or Adri-dhāraṇa.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Adri-dhāraṇa Prabhu says that today the <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> is going to Mathurā, and he will sit six hours watching the medicine being distilled. He's personally going to watch to see so that there's absolutely no mistake made. This is required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> This man is competent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I may not be an expert judge, but I have never seen, in my opinion, anyone who seemed to be this good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if we have program to go to Māyāpura, he has got that distilled medicine in his dispensary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, but one thing is this: the more time we can gain in waiting here, the better. In other words, he's not going to stay here indefinitely. That's a fact. He's going to have to go within the next few days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Adri-dhāraṇa:</span> He's planning to leave tomorrow. But we can hold him off for two more days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can hold him because, no doubt about it, the few extra days we gain will give you a little added strength. The main thing is that you should be feeling some positive effect from his treatments, because ultimately that is the real deciding factor. Our opinion of him.... He may be very nice looking, but if the medicine works, that is what counts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Of course, we don't know, but we're all feeling that you're feeling some effect. You told me the other night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It should be tangibly felt. It should be some actual, tangible result. You should have more strength, sitting up on your own or something of this kind. Then I'll believe that you're actually feeling better, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Because otherwise, psychologically, one may feel himself better, but then that should manifest in being able to sit up or something of that kind, turn around in bed on one's own.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think I am able to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, I'm encouraging you. I don't know if you can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now I cannot sit up independently.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Of course, that's a big step to take, but there's things like turning over in bed on one's own. I mean the point is one should not have to force oneself to do this, but those will be the signs of actual improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> But that will only come from renewal of strength. And renewal of strength will only come from appetite, when you start eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, it's not artificial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eating only juice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Milk... (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Juice is for maintaining. It's not for improving the condition. Juice you can maintain one's life, but to actually get strength you have to take something more substantial than juice. Milk is one thing, of course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> <span class="Italic">Kavirāja</span> is stressing on milk and barley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">kavirāja</span> said he had some cough medicine to put in the milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Yes. Yes. He gave it to me yesterday. But last night I didn't want to give the milk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what about now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhakti-caru:</span> Milk hasn't come. Next I will give. Say after about an hour. Now I will feed him the orange juice and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Maybe after <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Bengali) [break] How many plane go from Delhi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a... Delhi, there's two flights. One is in the morning, and the other one is in the evening. Morning flight is at about six-thirty in the morning, six-forty in the morning, and the evening flight is quite late, about eight o'clock at night. We would want to take the morning flight.
