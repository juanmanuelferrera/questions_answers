<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...was as you say (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> About the origin of the universe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Chance theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> To prove that theory of chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still they accept it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's no evidence, because you've explained many times that an orange always comes from an orange tree, a banana always comes from a banana tree, man always comes from man, and monkey always comes from monkey. We find that actually things are not happening by chance. That they're very much controlled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is. Nobody can deny it. Only this tenth-class man will deny it. Even third-class man, fourth class, he'll not deny. But what is that intelligence, one should make it a science. Intelligence there is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There's another theory that God created the universe, and then things are just happening haphazardly. There's no actual design or ultimate plan of creation. Simply He created, and things were set in motion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolish notion. Just like the seed, banyan tree seed, every plan is there: how the tree will grow, how the fruits will flower, flowers will come. Everything is there. That is intelligence. Within a small seed everything is there potency. <span class="Italic">Aśakti vividaiva. Sarvavidya.</span> It comes certainly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> One thing though, people, they see that there's birth and death, they don't understand the purpose of the whole creation when they see that so many things are going on like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is purpose. We have explained so many times. The purpose is that we have come here to enjoy, but this enjoyment is false. God has given us the chance to enjoy, to experience that this enjoyment is not good. They are simply suffering. They cannot enjoy. The plan is that he's given the chance to enjoy and experience that here there is no enjoyment and he's simply suffering. So when he comes to his sense, he again goes back home. The thief, he thinks that to live in the prison house is very good: "I haven't got to work, and I shall get my food and shelter." That is not.... That is a false enjoyment. Outside the prison, that is enjoyment. If one thinks that "I don't have to work; let me go to the prison house." Father wants that the sons should live in the family, but sometimes the son leaves the family and wants to enjoy independently. So he suffers. <span class="Italic">Jajīva (indistinct) māyā kare japoti (indistinct).</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Some philosophers feel that this understanding of God actually is no more than simply a wish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They feel that it is no more than a wish. That it is just simply a desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you are wish? You are also taking the chance, a wish that things must act like this. But that is not happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> It is just like a person who wants to turn all the metal in the world into gold. He may be wishing and desiring to turn everything into gold, but actually it is not possible. So therefore they say that we want to be protected against the onslaught of material nature. But actually that will never happen. So therefore they create God in this way. Or some person who wants to turn all the metal into gold, but actually it's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what you are doing? You are also doing everything hoping that you'll feel happy. Practically you're not doing anything. (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They think that everything was created just so that we could enjoy for a few years and then die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Unless they have solved the problems of death, all their hopes are useless. [break] ...is Sada? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sadaputa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sadaputa. He has said nicely that "They depend on chance. We depend on God." That's all. [break] Some dress? No, bird (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No, they have some bathing trunks on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sometimes they wear like a rubber suit. Something like the scales of a fish. It keeps them.... (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Aldous Huxley liked to think of the idea that there's no controller, so that he could enjoy without the feeling of guilt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the whole idea. Thieves and rogues, they think "If there's no government, then we can do whatever we like." Who is there of the thieves and rogues?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That description's given when after the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> killed King Vena, they saw a great huge dust cloud on the horizon from all the thieves and rogues rushing back into the kingdom (laughing) when there was no ruler.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Why doesn't he come to his senses there and then that "What have I done? Why don't I become God conscious?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like they surfer. What is that? They are in hell. But they have no sense that "What you are enjoying? It is hell." They are thinking they are enjoying. Is that enjoyment? It is actually hell. But he's thinking he's enjoying. That is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He's accepting something what is not. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Hog eating stool, and he's thinking he's enjoying. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> There are different grades of suffering, and still they are thinking they are enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> To really enjoy life you have to suffer a little bit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He doesn't know what is enjoyment. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So simply suffering is not a qualification for becoming God conscious then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Simply to suffer is not qualification for becoming God conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why suffering? Where is suffering? What you are suffering? We are God conscious. We are suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> No. No. Ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He means for approaching God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It is a prerequisite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not under...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> So we see that, in other words, when someone goes to hell...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he does not take it as suffering. Take it as enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Once you understand it's, ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unfortunate that they're taking suffering as enjoyment. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> <span class="Italic">māyā vase yaccho vese kacho haba...</span> Surfer, he is struggling against the waves, and they're thinking it is enjoyment. Chance of being drowned, being attacked by some sea animals. It is always risky and suffering. And still they're thinking enjoyment. But they're coming from far distant place to enjoy this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They get their enjoyment from taking a risk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. What is not suffering, they're taking risk as enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Material life is great suffering. Totally insensitive that they take such suffering to be enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is their punishment. They are being punished, but if you think that "I am punished," they will die. You must take it "I'm enjoying." This is <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> energy. They are being punished, but punishment they are taking as enjoyment. Illusion. The conditioned soul is illusioned. This is illusion. He is being punished, and he's thinking "I am enjoying." That is a concession. When he's punished, he may not be woke up with the unhappiness. Therefore he's thinking "I'm enjoying." Actually he's being punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> [break] ...saying though you have to laugh to keep from crying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> There's an old saying that things sometimes become so miserable that you have to laugh to keep from crying. So in the material world they have to keep laughing because everything is very miserable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like a criminal is put into the prison house for being punished, he will say, "Just see, I am living happily. I haven't got to work. I'm getting my food." (laughing) Such shameless. He does not know that "I am put here for suffering." But he's thinking "I'm so living happily.... I haven't got to work. Other men, they're going to the office, to the factory. I'm eating." (laughing) He forgets actually he's put into the prison house to suffer. He doesn't come to his senses. Therefore again when he's released, again he comes. He thinks that it is.... In Bengal they call social beggars (indistinct) Social beggars (indistinct) just like son-in-law goes to father-in-law's, and he's well received. So they think that prison house is social beggar (indistinct), another in-law's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In the West they experience that. That many of the men that go out of prison, they immediately commit some crime so that they can go straight back in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They think it is very nice. Yes. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He's into suffering, but he thinks this is very nice. It is called <span class="Italic">prakri badni dasuni (indistinct).</span> (Sanskrit) It is covered. Stool, worm. You take the stool worm from the stool and kick it aside, again it will go.... (laughing) "This is enjoyment. Why you are taking from me?" (laughing)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like the cockroaches. If you make everything clean, they go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> In Washington all of the drunks, they go in there and stay in the prison, and it was costing the government a great amount of money. So they passed the law that they were not going to put the drunks in jail any more because it was costing them such a big expense. They all want to go to jail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What about when someone goes to the hellish regions though? He actually suffers there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Of course. But he thinks that "I am enjoying."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. 'Cause after reading the descriptions in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> it seems it's pretty horrific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, when one is accustomed, then he thinks it is enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, and then he goes into another body to enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're going to become fish. Now they are being trained up how to become fish. So after this body is finished, they'll take a body of fish. When one becomes fish he doesn't know that this is punishment. He says that it is very nice. Concession by <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that he's put into suffering, but he'll think that "I am enjoying." This is mercy of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> [break]...anesthetic in surgical operation. Surgical operation, that is suffering, but if you apply some anesthetic, you do not perceive. It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> ...solution for this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sufficient chanting. That's all. <span class="Italic">Kirtanad eva kṛṣṇaśya mukta sanga param vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> In the fish body will he have to suffer for all his other sinful activities also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the beginning of suffering, to become fish, and then millions and millions of years he has to evolve himself to different life. (end)</div>
