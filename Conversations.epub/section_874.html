<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (sings) <span class="Italic">Śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu, dayā koro more...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, sometime today the new copies of the second volume of Seventh Canto are coming from the printer today. That's the volume with the section about Lord Nṛsiṁhadeva killing Hiraṇyakaśipu and Prahlāda's prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda was lecturing on that in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In Māyāpura you were lecturing on the prayers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So that volume is coming today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break]....culture and civilization is being introduced by Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement for the benefit of the whole human society. The modern civilization is not civilization. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti; mām eva param avyayam.</span> Ninety-nine percent or ninety-nine point nine percent people do not believe in the transmigration of the soul. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In India people believe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, India believes. India have no authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I think now there is.... People are becoming more interested in this theory. They say theory. I think there is more interest now. I'm talking to common people. They're...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if there is next life-they believe-then what they are doing for the next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The Christians only believe in one life, and after that one life you either go to heaven or to hell forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> For that reason people have rejected Christianity, because they cannot explain, for example, why a child, for example, is being killed. He's innocent. But by our philosophy it can be explained. For that, people, intelligent people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christian religion is speculation. All these philosophers, talking on Christian religion, speculating.... No clear idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> These church fathers that we've just done on the philosophy book, they are simply speculating about what was in the original Bible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No clear conception, scientific idea. Therefore educated persons, they are not interested. "God, give us daily bread." They will say, "Why we shall go to church for begging bread? We can manufacture it, large quantity." (laughs) Why they should go? Formality: "God, give us our daily bread." "Just open a big factory and eat as much bread as we like. Why should we go to God?" [break] ...Jawaharlal Nehru, he took this view, that "For economic development why should you go to the temple, ask this demigod, that demigod, 'Give me this. Give me this'? Develop industry and get money to enjoy." That is his.... [break]...description of God in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> begins: <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ sva-rāṭ [SB </span>1.1.1]. This is God, the origin of everything. Who is there who can challenge this explanation, "The origin of everything"? Now, what is that origin? Whether it is matter or sentient? No. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yato 'nvayād itarataś ca abhijñaḥ [SB </span>1.1.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> He knows everything. Therefore He's a person. Otherwise, how He can be origin of everything? <span class="Italic">Anvayād itarataś ca.</span> Suppose I.... If I have manufactured this car, then I know every nook and corner of this car, how I have manufactured. One who has manufactured, he knows how it is working, every minute feature. Even an expert driver, he knows how many parts are there, which part is.... <span class="Italic">Anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ.</span> If he's <span class="Italic">abhijñaḥ,</span> if he's completely cognizant of every part of the whole creation, then He has created.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda [break] ...a very clear day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Clear? That is not clear. So many clouds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I mean for visibility, for seeing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He says you can see the clouds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's no smog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, we were painting one painting for the last volume of Seventh Canto which shows that Kṛṣṇa is in the heart of all living entities. Now, the question came up whether Kṛṣṇa.... Since Kṛṣṇa is inside every atom, are there living entities in every atom? So I said that you had already answered that, that Kṛṣṇa is never alone, so there must be some living entity within the atom. So then the question was: Is this atom one of the bodies, just like human body, and then gradually that living entity gets a higher body, higher body, or does he always remain inside the atom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Body does not develop. He changes body. Why don't you understand this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He changes body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The motorcar does not develop. I change this motorcar to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But that's the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Darwin's theory. Motorcar is not developing to big motorcar. That is nonsense. Motorcar is motorcar, but I can change from this car to that car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, that's what he was wondering, whether the spirit soul leaves the atom to take another higher body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is always.... Transmigration means going on, simply changing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Is that counted as one of the 8,400,000 species? Is the atom counted among the different species?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atom is not manifested. May be one of the species, but the total is 8,400,000. What is the difference between the small atom and this body? The same thing, material. It's very small; it is a little bigger. That's all. And similarly, the universe is still bigger. After all, it is matter. [break] ...<span class="Italic">prakṛti. Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is this? He's standing on election? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It is written in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> that when Lord Caitanya entered this universe, the entire universe was blessed, or benefited. So I'm wondering how Lord Caitanya's movement is going on on other planets other than this planet. Is there some organized <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How other planetary system is going on, you do not know, but we can guess it is going on like this. <span class="Italic">Anumāna. Pratyakṣa anumāna.</span> One thing is direct perception, another by guessing. <span class="Italic">Pratyakṣa anumāna</span> and <span class="Italic">śabda</span> and <span class="Italic">śruti, aitihya.</span> There are so many evidences. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">. Śrī kṛṣṇa caitanya prabhu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Devotees once told me you said that the demigods like this movement very much so that they're standing in line to take their birth in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They like to come here on this planet. Just like you Kṛṣṇa conscious men, you are very much enthusiastic to go to India. India has no material attraction, but why our men wanted to go to India in spite of so many difficulties? Similarly, in the higher planet, heavenly planet, they are so much engrossed with material happiness that there is no facility. But here there is facility, in this earth, Bhūrloka. <span class="Italic">Bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ tayāpahṛta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 2.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> One who is too much attached to material convenience and everything, they have no opportunity for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you wrote that we don't have to be concerned that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement will deliver the whole world, because it will fill up again. Even if we can bring everyone back to Godhead, it will just be finished up again with more conditioned souls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there are so many conditioned souls, one after another, coming. And the conditioned souls are the few of the whole living entities. Just imagine what is the total! (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> It can't be imagined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And majority in the spiritual world, and one fourth, minority, is here in so many innumerable universes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> There are also many spirit souls in the Brahman effulgence, the spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The spiritual sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Full of these souls. They have no forms. Just like sun. Sunshine means small illuminating sparks. [break] (out of car:) Flowers, they are good medicine for dysentery. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> ...surrounded by mountains, but normally the air is so dirty, it's not possible to see them, but today it's so clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...bluff subject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The edge of the cliff, there may be some rockslide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like the path used to go there, but it fell through.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Path may slide? That is a warning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They put that warning there so that no one can sue the city authorities if someone is killed if the cliff falls apart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore not many people come here. [break] ...animal kingdom, by nature's arrangement, the couple, one male and one female, is fixed up, fixed up, this one female, one male. But amongst the monkeys, dogs and jackals, there is no fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Anything that comes along.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore in the human society, a man and woman not fixed up, they are monkeys, jackals and dogs. By marriage it is fixed up, but if they do not fix up, they are compared with the jackals, dogs and monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Hogs as well?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? Hogs, also like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> From the material point of view people cannot see the purpose of accepting responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow. What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, from the spiritual point of view, we know that if we're not responsible, then we have to suffer great consequences according to our actions. From the material point of view, though, people can live an irresponsible life, and they have some earnings. They feel that they can enjoy. What is the need for morality?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is a responsible life? Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, their whole plan is to avoid responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is sinful. As soon as you irresponsible, you are sinful. [break] ...soon as you forget the simple truth that you are servant of God, you are irresponsible. Now your suffering begins. [break] ...<span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bahirmukha hañā bhoga vāñchā kare, nikaṭa-stha māyā tāre jāpaṭiyā dhare</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>(<span class="Italic">Prema-vivarta</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like as citizen of your state, you have to abide by the laws of the state. As soon as you disobey, you are irresponsible. That's all. You suffer. Good citizen means who abides by the laws of the state. And as soon as you break it, immediately you are irresponsible and you must be punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Practically, though, without God consciousness, isn't it that people see that whether they are moral or not moral, they still suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This material world is meant for suffering. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the description in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This is a place for suffering. And that is also temporary. You cannot make adjustment: "Never mind, it is suffering; I shall remain here." No, that also will not be allowed. <span class="Italic">Duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the marriage ceremonies that they have, they make vow before God that "Until death do us part, we will not separate," but so many divorces are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> If a man can have an affair with many different women, he's considered fortunate. It is his success.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's on the front page of all the magazines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Bachelor daddy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they want to become <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> That is the tendency, <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like transcendental hippie-life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other relationship of Kṛṣṇa rejected, take, jump over the <span class="Italic">gopīs'</span> relationship. This is the meaning. [break] ...this line? Is it not? So as many lines, that means so many years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] ...cut inside the tree, there's circles, and for each circle that means one year. That's what they say, anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Island separate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahendra:</span> That's an island, Śrīla Prabhupāda, yes. Santa Catalina island. It's a very big tourist resort. We were just discussing how it would be nice to send <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party there for book distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopavṛndapāla:</span> We already do that every weekend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...problems. It seems there are so many social problems in the world today that by patchwork nothing can, er, can't hope to come of anything good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they do not know what is the aim of life. [break] ...one center. With center, you can draw so many circles, big or small; they will not overlap. But if you have got different center, it will overlap. Your circle will come upon me; my circle will go upon.... So there is <span class="Italic">svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum.</span> They do not know the central point is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> People sometimes criticize us that if our movement becomes very large and everyone chants Hare Kṛṣṇa, no one will want to become a doctor or technician, and everything will fall to hell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you say if your movement goes on, there will be no need of that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtirāja:</span> No lawyers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No need. Simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No one to run the factories?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no need. These are <span class="Italic">anarthas,</span> unnecessary things. So in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata, anarthopaśamaṁ sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> When there is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogam adhokṣaje,</span> all these <span class="Italic">anarthas</span> useless. <span class="Italic">Anartha-nivṛttiḥ syāt.</span> People may not misunderstand that we don't want other things. We want everything, but we want central point, Kṛṣṇa. [break] (in car:) ...Bharati, with whom you had some talks, he does not speak anymore?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> We have not heard anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He tries to cause a disturbance, though, whenever he can. I was told by one of the boys in the Library Party that he's prevented a lot of standing orders being taken by speaking with professors and condemning our movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's still creating a disturbance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cancelling standing orders?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've actually taken standing orders and then had them cancelled because of this man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Not so much, but he's doing it when he can. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...surprised that you have written so many books. They cannot understand how you could write so much. They wonder whether you were a great Sanskrit scholar for many years, so they try to guess. They just can't imagine anyone writing so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are exceeding all material authors except Vyāsadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Vyāsadeva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One book, seventeen volumes, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> That is also.... So many, our Godbrothers, attempted. Everyone is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Have any of your Godbrothers translated anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They died half-way finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīdhara Mahārāja never did anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They wonder where you have made the time to study so much about ancient Indian culture that you could write so much. They cannot understand that. They read.... There is a biography of Your Divine Grace in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> that mentions different things, and they just can't understand how you could know so much. It is beyond material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One young man in Tokyo or some airport, very nice young man. He came. I was sitting. "Swamiji, can I talk with you?" "Yes." So, "I have seen your photograph. Where you have got so much vast knowledge?" (laughs) And I..., "It is not my knowledge; it is Vyāsadeva's knowledge." So his first question was, intelligent boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He'd obviously read fair amounts of your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here is a house, four-story?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That one's three-story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three? And down, motor garage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the biggest, but I discussed with Karandhara, and he said they will not give permission for more than two stories. He has already inquired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have some crazy reason. They make very strict laws regarding housing. It is a problem everywhere in the United States, so many things you have to comply with. Just like in Dallas there were so many things they wanted us to do for housing. (end)</div>
