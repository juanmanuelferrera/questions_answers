<div class="Heading">Answers to a Questionnaire<br class="calibre2"/>from Bhavan's Journal<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 28, 1976, Vṛndāvana</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Beginning, from the beginning. You can add something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Read out what it is and everything as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is a questionnaire which was sent to us by one journal, a cultural and religious journal in Bombay. It's called Bhavan's Journal. And they are questioning different religious leaders, especially in India, trying to get the answers to some of these important questions which are perplexing especially the Indian public today. So there's a list of about 21 questions, and we can go through them one by one for Śrīla Prabhupāda to answer. The first question, "Is the influence of religion over the masses on the wane?" Is the influence of religion over the masses decreasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is predicted in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Tataḥ anudinam.</span> Bring that black book, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Tatas cānudinaṁ dharmaḥ satyam.</span> This is Kali-Yuga, the age of waning of these things. Religiosity, truthfulness, memory, bodily strength, duration of life, mercifulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Pradyumna's just going to come with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are, will be declining. These are the, I mean to say, human assets which makes a human being distinct from the animals. But these things will decline. There will be no mercifulness, there will be no truthfulness, the memory will be shortened, duration life shortened. Similarly religion will vanish. So that means gradually they will come to the platform of animals. And especially when there is no religion, it is simply animals. That any common man can distinguish, that... a dog does not understand what is religion. He's also a living being. He's not interested what is going on here about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-Gītā</span> or <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> He is not interested. That is the distinction between dog and man. The animal is not interested. So if the human being becoming disinterested in religious things, then they are animals. And how there can be happiness, peace, in the animal society? They want to keep people as animal, and they are making United Nations. How it is possible? "United Animals?" Is it possible? "Society for United Animals." (laughter) So these things are going on. So they have detected it is declining, that is good. Declining means they are going to be animals. In the logic it is said, "Man is rational animal." So rationality minus..., animal. Where is human being? (aside:) you stand be... No. there is no place. That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Second question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Question two?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have written all these things or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's being taped. I'll transcribe it later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that? Find out <span class="Italic">tatas canudinam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Tatas cānudinaṁ satyaḥ, dharmaḥ satyaṁ śaucaṁ kṣama daya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Find that verse. You can quote that "This Kali-yuga it is waning; therefore they are becoming animals." Man without religion means animals. That's all. This is the definition. In the human society, either you become Christian or you become Mohammedan or you become a Hindu or you become Buddhist. It doesn't matter. There must be some system of religion. That is human society. And human society without religion-animal society. This is plain fact. So why people are unhappy now? Because there is no religion. They are neglecting religion. That one gentleman, he has written me that Tolstoy said that "Unless one dynamite is put underneath a church, there cannot be any peace." That means they want... The Russians, the Communists, they are very strict against God consciousness. Because they think so, that this religion has spoiled the whole social atmosphere. It might have been misused, religious system. That does not mean that religion should be avoided. Real religion should be taken. Because religion has not been properly executed by the so-called priest, it does not mean that religion should be rejected. My eye is giving some trouble on account of cataract, but that doesn't mean eye should be plucked out. The cataract should be removed. So that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. They have no conception of God, and they are preaching religion. What is that religion? That will be misused. Religion means <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sāksād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Religion means God's order. If there is no God, where is religion? This is going on. They have no conception of God. What is God they do not know, and professing some religion. How long it will go on artificially? It will deteriorate. That has become the present condition. They have no idea of God, and how they will know what is the order of God? And religion means order of God. Just like law means order of the state. Law means order of the state. So if there is no state, where is the order? You can manufacture your own order. That is going on. There is no conception of God. We have got clear conception of God. Here is God, Kṛṣṇa. And He's giving orders. We accept it. And it is clear religion. And if there is no God, no conception of God, no order of God, then where is religion? If there if no government, then where is law? Outlaw. Everyone is outlaw. That is going on. Ask any religious system what is the conception of God. Can anyone tell clearly? Nobody can say. We shall immediately say, <span class="Italic">veṇuṁ kvaṇantam aravinda-dalāyatākṣaṁ barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">. Aṅgāni yasya sakalendriya-vṛttimanti...</span> immediately description, "Here is God." Then there is religion. And if there is no God, where is religion? Bogus. Therefore declining. They have no conception of God, and therefore there is no understanding of religion. Therefore it is declining. So this is the cause of declining. And because it is declining, human being becoming more animals. Animal means there will be no memory. A dog comes... Here is some eatables. He comes. I say, "Hut!" He goes away. Again he comes. No memory. So when this memory is reducing that means human quality is reduced. So in the Kali-yuga these eight things will reduce. That means they are becoming like cats and dogs. This is the answer to the first question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question number two? </div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "The traditional charge against Hinduism is that it is fatalistic, that it inhibits progress by making people slaves to the belief in the inevitability of what is to happen. How far is this charge true?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The charge is false. Those who have charged like that, they do not know what is Hinduism. There is no such thing as Hinduism, but there is mention of <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma, varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> That we can find in the scriptures. I've already given note.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I have that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is his, what is the charge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He says that people are accusing that Hinduism, it inhibits the progress of mankind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that progress? Dog's jumping is progress? (laughter) Is that progress? A dog is running here and there, here and there, and you are running on the four wheels? Is that progress? That is not Vedic system. The Vedic system is that human being has got a certain amount of energy. Better energy than the animals. Better consciousness. That should be utilized for spiritual advancement. So whole Vedic system is meant for spiritual advancement. The energy is employed in another direction, not the energy is employed to compete with the dog. Therefore sometimes those who have no idea of religion, they see that the... "Hindus" is not the proper term. The Indian saintly persons, they are not busy like the dogs. Because they think the dog race is life. But actual life is spiritual progress. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says,</div>
<div class="Verse">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido<br class="calibre2"/>na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukhaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kālena sarvatra gabhīra-raṁhasā<br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The human being should exert the energy for that thing which he did not get in many, many lives. Many, many lives he had been in the form of dogs or demigods or cats, birds, beasts, many. There are 8,400,000. So this transmigration is going on, but in everywhere the business is sense gratification. The dog is busy for sense gratification. Where is food, where is shelter, where is woman or man, and where is defense. And the man is also doing the same business in different forms. So this is going on, life after life. Even in small insect, this is also trying for the same thing. Same struggle, <span class="Italic">ahara-nidra-bhaya-maithunam.</span> Bird, beast, animal, fish-everywhere the same struggle. Where is food, where is sex, and where is shelter, and how to defend. So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says these things we have done in many, many lives past, and if we don't get out of this struggle for existence we'll have to do it again in many, many lives. So these things should be stopped. So Prahlāda Mahārāja says therefore,</div>
<div class="Verse">sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā<br class="calibre2"/>deha-yogena dehinām<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra labhyate daivād<br class="calibre2"/>yathā duḥkham ayatnataḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">He's advising that, "My dear friends, pleasure, material pleasure, on account of this material body, particular type of body...": A dog, it has got a body, and I have got a body. So my sex pleasure and dog's sex pleasure, there is no difference. the pleasure derived out of sex pleasure is the same. But a dog is not afraid of having sex pleasure on the street before everyone. We hide it. That's all. In a nice apartment. But the business is the same. There is no difference. But they are taking this sex pleasure in a nice apartment and very decorated, man and woman, and electric light and so on, so on. This pleasure is advanced. But that is not advanced. And they are making dog's race for this advancement. Superficial. The Prahlāda Mahārāja says that this is a question of different types of pleasure on account of different types of body, but the pleasure is the same. But according to the different types of body the pleasure is already fixed up. That is called destiny. A pig has got a certain type of body and his eatable is the stool. It is already fixed up. You cannot change it, that "Let the pig eat <span class="Italic">halavā.</span>" It is not possible. Because he has got a particular type of body, he must eat that. Can anyone, any scientist can improve the standard of living of a pig? Is it possible?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (laughing) No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says it is already fixed up. <span class="Italic">Sukham aindriyakaṁ daityā deha-yogena dehinām.</span> This pleasure is the same, but according to the body... The uncivilized man in the jungle, they are having the same thing. And they are taking civilization that "Instead of living in that hut made of leaves, we are living in skyscraper building. This is advancement." But Vedic civilization says, "No. This is not advancement. The advancement is self-realization, how much you have realized yourself." Not that from the hutment you have come to skyscraper building, therefore it is advancement. Sometimes they misunderstand. In a high-court a judge is sitting soberly, doing nothing, and he is getting the highest salary. And another man in the same court, he's working day and hard rubber-stamping and he is getting not even one tenth of the salary. He's thinking, "I am so busy and working so hard. I am not getting any good salary. And this man is sitting only on the bench and he's getting so fat salary." So therefore this is question like that. The Vedic civilization is for self-realization. <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">. Kovido</span> means very learned. He'll simply try for that thing which was not received, which was not achieved in other life. That means self-realization. Just like we are sometimes charged, "escape." What is the charge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> We are escaping from reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is the question. (devotees laugh) but their reality is dog's race, and our reality is to advance in self-realization, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is difference. Therefore <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> asses. Asses. And asses, why the example is given to the asses? Because the ass works very hard. It loads on the back tons of cloth of the washerman, and the washerman in return gives him little morsel of grass, and he stands at the door of the washerman, eats the grass, again loading. But he has no sense that "If I go out of these clutches of washerman I can get grass anywhere. Why I am loading so much?" The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are like that. They're busy in the office, very busy. If you want to see him, "I am very busy now." (laughter) So what is your result of busy? "Now, I take two pieces of toast and one cup of tea. That's all." (laughter) And for this purpose you are so busy? He does not know why he's busy. Because in the books he's finding, "Now, the balance was one thousand million dollars, now it has become two thousand," that his satisfaction. But he will eat two pieces of bread and one cup of tea. When it was one million dollars, when it was two million dollars. But still he'll work hard. This is called <span class="Italic">karmī.</span> Asses. Work like asses, without any aim of life. This is asses. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> But Vedic civilization is different. The accusation is not correct. They are not lazy. They are busy for higher subject matter. And that busy-ness is so important that Prahlāda Mahārāja says, "Beginning from the childhood," <span class="Italic">kaumāra ācaret prājño [SB </span>7.6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Not lose a second time. So that is Vedic civilization. But these asses, they do not see that "These men are working like us, like dogs and asses. So they are escaping." Yes, escaping your fruitless endeavor. So the Vedic civilization was meant for self-realization. Vedic civilization begins from the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system. <span class="Italic">Varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān viṣṇur ārādhyate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> How to realize Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Therefore the system is <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> In another place it is said, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā sva-dharmaṁ caraṇāmbujaṁ harer</span> [SB 1.5.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> means there is division: <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> But the ultimate goal is <span class="Italic">viṣṇur ārādhyate.</span> The Supreme Lord should be worshiped. That is the idea. So if Viṣṇu <span class="Italic">ārādhana</span> is available immediately, then you can give up all other occupational duty as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> as a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> everything. Take to it, immediately, to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is so important. But that they do not know. Therefore there is no religion. A simply dog's race. The dog is running on four legs and you are running on four wheels. That's all. And they think the four-wheel race is advancement of civilization. But the Vedic civilization is different. <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām upary adhaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then one can say that "Then we shall do nothing?" Yes, practically it is said, "Do nothing." Whatever is obtainable by you or destiny, you'll get it wherever you are. Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. You'll get it. "How I, shall I get it?" Now, <span class="Italic">kālena sarvatra gabhīra-raṁhasā.</span> By the arrangement of eternal time, everything is available. The example is given that you do not want something distressful. As it comes upon you, similarly, even if you do not want, the happiness for which you are destined, it will come. Now, Prahlāda Mahārāja says, <span class="Italic">na tat-prayāsaḥ kartavyam.</span> You should not waste your energy for material happiness. Because you cannot get material happiness more than what you are destined to have. That is not possible. "How shall I believe..." Because you get something distressful condition although you do not want. Who wants? In our country Mahatma Gandhi was killed by his own countrymen. Who did want it? Or why did it come? He was great man, he was protected by so many and.... Still, he was to be killed. Destiny. He was killed. Who can protect you? "So if the distressed condition come compulsory upon me, the other condition, the opposite number, also will come. Why shall I waste my time for this rectification? Let me utilize my energy for Kṛṣṇa consciousness." That is intelligence. You cannot check your destiny. Their question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That, the charge is that Hinduism is fatalistic, and therefore people are not making progress because they simply accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They are misguided. First of all, the Hinduism is also misguiding. There is no such thing as Hinduism. It is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> I do not know how this word... Most probably it was given by the Mohammedans, "Hindus." But there is no such thing. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> I don't find any word as "Hindu." Is there any word? Throughout the whole? There is no such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a second part to this question also, Śrīla Prabhupāda. They ask: if it's false that actually Hinduism is not fatalistic or <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is not fatalistic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Fatalistic in this sense, that the destiny cannot be changed. Just like I have given already the example, that the Mahatma Gandhi, nobody expected that he would be killed by his own countryman. Why it happened? This means destiny cannot change. This is a prominent example, that Mahatma Gandhi, he was in a big meeting. Who expected that Mahatma Gandhi could be killed, and by his own countryman? But it was done. That is destiny. You cannot check it. So our point is that... The whole Vedic civilization is that destiny, a certain amount of happiness in this material world... Nobody is enjoying uninterrupted happiness. That is not possible. A certain amount of so-called happiness and certain amount of so-called distress. There must be always. So as you cannot check your distressed condition of life, similarly you cannot check your happy condition of life. It will come automatically. So don't waste your time for these things. You better utilize your energy for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So those who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they think that "These people are wasting time."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then, is it true then that people who have this conception, they would not try for progress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Progress... The thing is that if you try progress vainly, what is the use of trying? If it is a fact you cannot change your destiny, so why should you try for that? Better... That is the... <span class="Italic">Tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta.</span> Therefore whatever energy you have got, you utilize it for understanding Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Make it clear. Just like our society. We are, our main business is how to make advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are not very enthusiastic to open big, big factories and big, big money-earning machine. No. We are not interested. We'll be satisfied with the amount of happiness or distress, whatever we are destined. Let us utilize our energy for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the point. So the Vedic civilization is meant for realization of God. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇur aradhyate.</span> So they try for that. And now, at the present moment.... Actually, the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharmi,</span> they never tried for economic development. You'll find in India still, thousands of men taking bath in the Ganges. In the <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela...</span> You have been in <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At the <span class="Italic">Kumbhamela</span> millions of people are coming to take bathing in the Ganges because they are interested how to become liberated. They're not lazy. They're going thousands miles, two thousand miles away, to take bathing in the Prayāgaa. So they are not lazy. But they are not busy in the dog's race. <span class="Italic">Yā niśā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti saṁyamī. Saṁyamī.</span> He keeps night, he does not sleep. Others are sleeping. So similarly, the dogs and asses, they think that "They are not working." And they are working. The different platforms. So the Vedic civilization which is practiced in India... Now it is distorted, but actually, they are not lazy. They are very, very busy. Not only very, very busy, but from, they are trying to become self-realized from the very beginning of life. <span class="Italic">Kaumāraṁ...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Kaumāraṁ acaret prajñā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prajño dharmaṁ bhāgavatan iha.</span> That is recommended. They are not lazy. They are so busy that want to begin the business from the very childhood. So it is a wrong conception that they are lazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then if this is false that actually they're not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> they do not know what is the aim of life. They think that "they are not racing like dog; therefore, they are lazy." But they are busy, very busy, from the childhood. But they have no eyes to see what is, business means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The second point is, in connection with this question, that there's a certain class of people in India-he describes them as being advanced, well-meaning and highly educated people in India today-that they're accusing Hinduism of inhibiting progress and he wants to know why is this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is explained. They do not know what is progress. The Vedic civilization is not interested in this so-called false progress. Just like from hut to skyscraper. They think this is progress. But the Vedic civilization thinks how much he is advanced in self-realization. Either he is in cottage or in skyscraper. But if he wastes his time to turn the huts into skyscrapers, then the whole life is finished. And next time he is going to be a dog. He does not know. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? They want to know how this can be counteracted, this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Don't get...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> (whispering) this is going to be transcribed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make everything clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that is very clear. Would you like to hear the next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is clear or now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So long it is not clear, you can go on asking. One question after one question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The point was made by you that they don't understand what actual progress is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, destiny cannot be checked. That I have already given. Even Mahatma Gandhi could not. The destiny you cannot check.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But then the question may be raised if destiny cannot be checked, then why not, when a child is born, simply let him like an animal run around and whatever happens to him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is the advantage of... you can train him spiritually. That is possible. Therefore it is said, <span class="Italic">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> For that purpose you engage your energy. That is open. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> The devotional service, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, <span class="Italic">apratihatā,</span> it cannot be checked. Material destiny can be checked, or it cannot be checked. Similarly, your advancement in spiritual life cannot be checked if you endeavor for it. But your advancement of so-called material happiness, that is already destined. You cannot check it. Try to understand this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So then in terms of advancing in spiritual life, actually we can't say that the <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is fatalistic. That there is actually endeavor towards progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fatalistic... I have given this example also. Just like a man is condemned by the law court to be hanged. Nobody can check it. Nobody can check. Even the same judge who has given this verdict, he cannot check. But if he begs for the mercy of the king, he can check it. He can go all above the law. Therefore, <span class="Italic">karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said that destiny can be changed by Kṛṣṇa for His devotees. Otherwise it is not possible. If one is condemned to death, Kṛṣṇa can check it. Otherwise, it is falsehood when Kṛṣṇa.... <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span>" I shall give you protection from all reaction of sinful activities." Suppose you are to be killed by somebody on account of your sinful activity. Nobody can check it, ordinarily, but Kṛṣṇa can check it. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa's telling false, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi,</span> "I shall give you protection." So therefore our business should be only to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. And if you artificially want to be more happy by economic development, that is not possible. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question number three?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? No, first of all clear by your so, melforce(?) (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It may take several issues to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Try to understand what is that. The first thing is that your destiny cannot be changed. That's a fact. But in spite of your destiny, if you try for Kṛṣṇa consciousness... Otherwise, why Prahlāda Mahārāja is asking his friends, <span class="Italic">kaumāra ācaret...</span>? If the destiny cannot be changed, then why he's asking? It is not the... Destiny means material business. That you cannot check. But it can also be checked when you are in spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the meaning of <span class="Italic">apratihatā?</span> You said that spiritual development cannot be checked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pratihatā</span> means suppose you are destined to suffer. So <span class="Italic">apratihatā</span> means in spite of your so-called suffering, the suffering will be reduced or there will be no suffering. But in spite of suffering, you can make progress in spiritual life. Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja himself, his father was putting him in so many suffering conditions but it was not impeded. He was making progress. He was making progress. He didn't care for father'sputting him into so many suffering. That is called <span class="Italic">apratihatā.</span> If you want to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness, your material condition of life cannot check it. That is the progress (?) (indistinct). But so far material condition, that cannot be checked. You have to suffer. But in case of devotee that suffering also, can be stopped. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa's version is false: <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> Suffering is there on account of my sinful activities but Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.</span> Make it clear. Ordinarily destiny cannot be checked. Therefore instead of wasting your time for change your economic condition or material destiny, you employ this energy for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That cannot be checked. Your so-called... So many men we can see, they are working so hard, does it mean that everyone has become a Ford, a Rockefeller? Why? Everyone is trying his best. Mr. Ford was to become rich man, his destiny was there, he became rich man. But does it mean that other man who has worked so hard like Ford, he has become like a Ford? No. This is practical. You cannot change your destiny simply by working hard like ass (?) and dogs. No. But you can utilize your energy for improving your Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact. He was destined to be killed by his countryman, he was not? Such a big man, such vigilance and so many people were guarding him and still he was killed in the meeting. Why Mahatma Gandhi? Your president, ex, Kennedy. Was less protection was taken? No, every was there, everything was there but still he was killed. Who can stop this destiny? So destiny cannot be checked. The fatalists, they know, "My material happiness or distress, it cannot be checked. It will happen so why shall I waste my energy for this purpose. Let me utilize my energy for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness." Therefore it is said <span class="Italic">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labyhate yad bhramatām</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]<span class="Italic">,</span> that is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, if destiny cannot be changed, what does Kṛṣṇa mean when He says, "Be thou happy by this sacrifice."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you know what is meant by sacrifice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Sacrifice to Viṣṇu, to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means to please Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is pleased He can change destiny. <span class="Italic">Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti bhājāṁ [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Sacrifice means to please Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajña</span> means to please Kṛṣṇa. The whole, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means to please Kṛṣṇa. That is the whole program. In all other business there is no question of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. When they declare war, one nation to another, there is no question of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. They're pleasing their whims. The two, big, big wars began, it was not for pleasing Kṛṣṇa. The Germans wanted that their sense gratification is being hampered by the Britishers, "Declare war." That means it was a war of sense gratification. "The Britishers are satisfying their sense gratification; we cannot do. All right, fight." So, there was no question of pleasing Kṛṣṇa. Hm. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question number three. It is said that the greatest strength of Hinduism is its catholicity, or breadth of outlook, broadness of vision, but that this is also the greatest weakness in that there is very little common prescribed religious observances which are obligatory for all as in other religions. Is it necessary and possible to outline certain basic minimum observances for all Hindus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So far Vedic religion is concerned, it is not for the Hindus. That is to be understood. The <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> It is for all living entities, all human beings. It is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> That I have already explained. The living entity is <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> God is <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> and there is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma. Paras tasmāt tu bhāvo 'nyo 'vyakto 'vyaktāt sanātanaḥ [Bg. 8.20].</span> And where Kṛṣṇa is described <span class="Italic">sanātana</span> in the Eleventh Chapter. Do you remember? He is described as <span class="Italic">sanātana. Sanātanam.</span> So actually, the Vedic system is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> Not Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> This is a wrong conception. The <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is meant for all living entities, not the so-called Hindus, Muslims, Christians. For everyone. That is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> These are later misconceptions, Hinduism and this ism, that ism, that ism. Actually, it is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> That is meant for everyone. But because it was being followed regularly in India and Indians were called by the Muslims on the other side of the River Sind, or Sindu, and they pronounce Sind as Hind. Therefore they called India as Hindustan, means on the other side of Sindu, or Hindu River. Otherwise, it has no Vedic reference. So this Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma</span> has no Vedic reference. The real Vedic <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma, varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> First of all he has to understand this. Now that <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> or Vedic <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> being distorted, not being obeyed, not being carried properly, it has come to the understanding of Hinduism. That is a freak understanding. That is not real understanding. We have to study <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> or <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> Then we'll understand what is Vedic religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is there anything obligatory or prescribed for all people who follow this religion, that a minimum observance that they must do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">sanātana...</span> The <span class="Italic">sanātana...</span> Every living entity is eternal, <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span> God is eternal, and we can live with God in a place which is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dhāma.</span> So this reciprocation is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> So Vedic religion means this <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> not Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or Muslim <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> or this <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">tvam akṣaraṁ paramaṁ veditavyaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tvam asya viśvasya paraṁ nidhānam<br class="calibre2"/>tvam avyayaḥ śāśvata-dharma-goptā<br class="calibre2"/>sanātanas tvaṁ puruṣo mato me</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Translation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Your are the supreme primal objective. You are the best in all the universes. You are inexhaustible and You are the oldest. You are the maintainer of religion, the eternal Personality of Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is wanted. Kṛṣṇa is eternal, we are eternal, and the place we live, exchanging our feelings, that is eternal. And the system which teaches this eternal system of reciprocation, that is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> That is meant for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what daily prescribed religious observances would one who is aspiring for this <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> what would they do? What kind of daily prescribed religious observance? Because the complaint is that within this Hinduism, or let's say <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> there is such a breadth, there is so much variegatedness in different types...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why do you go to variegatedness? Why don't you take the real purpose of religion from Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa says, "This is real <span class="Italic">dharma,</span>" <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ...</span> [Bg. 18.66]." Why don't you take that? Why are you going to variegated things or varieties under the name of so-called Hinduism? Why do you go there? Why don't you take the advice of the <span class="Italic">sanātana,</span> Kṛṣṇa? You don't take what is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> what <span class="Italic">sanātana</span> God says, and you say, "How we can come to the right point, avoiding so many varieties?" Why you go to the varieties? Take to this one consciousness, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ.</span> Why don't you do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How can people practically do this on a daily basis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How we are doing? Is it not practical? They'll manufacture their own way of religion. And that is... That is not practical. You take this practical system. What is this? <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī...</span> Where is impracticality? You simply think of Kṛṣṇa, become His devotee, worship Kṛṣṇa. Or just offer a little obeisances to Kṛṣṇa. Where is the difficulty? Why don't you do that? Kṛṣṇa says, "This is the duty. If you do this, you come to Me." <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśaya.</span> "Without any doubt you'll come to Me." Why don't you do that? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why you remain Hindu? Why you remain Muslim? Why you remain Christian? Give up all this nonsense. Just surrender to Kṛṣṇa. "I am devotee of Kṛṣṇa, servant of Kṛṣṇa." Take this. Then everything will be immediately done. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> So why you want to remain Hindu? And try to adjust things? <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> What God says, that is <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Now, God says that "You give up all this. You just surrender unto Me." So take that <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> Why you want to remain a Hindu? And who is a Hindu who does not accept the authority of Kṛṣṇa? Who is a Hindu? If any Hindu says, even up till now, that "I don't care for Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span>" he will be immediately rejected as a madman. Why don't you take Kṛṣṇa's instruction? Why do you go outside? Therefore your trouble is there. You do not know what is religion, you do not know what is Hinduism, what is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> You do not know anything. And actually, practically, you see that in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there are so-called Hindus, so-called Muslims. They do not care for Muslim or Hindu or Christian. They are taking care of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. If you take care of false religious system, then you suffer. You take real religious system, then you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes it's also seen, say, that Muslims and Hindus they will be converted to Christianity, and the same argument can be given. So what would be the difference for the, in this case, that one who is identifying himself as Christian or one is identifying himself as devotee of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you have to understand what is religion. The religion is God's law. You have to understand. Religion does not mean your manufactured, concocted ideas. What God says, that is religion. So here Kṛṣṇa is God. He is saying. Therefore this is religion. Is that clear? Make it clear. So long one point is not clear, don't go to the next point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Especially he is trying to inquire that it appears that India, for example, today...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But India, they have given up the real religious system, <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma,</span> or <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> Fictitiously, they have accepted a hodgepodge thing which is called Hinduism. Therefore there is trouble. Everywhere, but India especially, they are... Vedic religion... Vedic religion means <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> That is... Kṛṣṇa says, God says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭam [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So that is, what is called, obligatory. Just like law is obligatory. You cannot say that "I don't take this law." No. You have to take it if you want to have a happy. You cannot become outlaw. Then you'll not be happy. You'll be punished. So God says <span class="Italic">mayā sṛṣṭam.</span> "It is given by Me." So how we can deny it? And that is religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">. Dharmam</span> means the order given by the God. The God says that <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> "For the proper management of the human society, there should be these four divisions, social divisions." So you have to take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This would be the prescription for all people?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone, for all people. There must be on the head the intelligent class of men who will give advice. Then next class, the... That is all given in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> But when you become Kṛṣṇa conscious you can give up all these regulative principles directly. Therefore Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa-dharma, kṣatriya-dharma,</span> or this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> that <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> Hindu <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> Mussulman <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> If you have everything, simply... Because the ultimate aim of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is to come to Kṛṣṇa. "You directly come to Me; then everything is all right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So many other people, they concoct their own system and they say "This is the way to go to God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let them suffer. What can be done? What can be done? If you don't take the laws of the state, you manufacture your own laws, then you'll suffer. If the state says, "Keep to the right," and if make your own law, "No, keep to the left," then you'll suffer. It's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So many innocent people are also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So innocent suffers. Intelligent never suffers. Only the rascals, innocent, they suffer. Innocent means rascal also. He does not know what is, what to do. The rascal is also innocent. A child is innocent, but he's a rascal. It does not mean because he's innocent, he's not rascal. Rascal means he's innocent also. The child does not know that, "If I touch fire it will burn." Therefore he's a rascal. But because he is child, innocent, he'll not be excused. The rascal and innocent on the same category. Innocence of law is not, no excuse. If you go to the court, if you say, "Sir I did not know there is law like this," that does not mean... You must suffer. Why Kṛṣṇa comes? He gives advice that "You do this. Don't remain innocent and rascal. Then you'll be happy." Why should you stick to the rascaldom? He's personally advising. He says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why you are sticking to Hinduism and Muslimism and Christianism? Why? That is rascaldom. You take to His advice and you be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But these religions are just material. These Hindu, Christian, Muslim, they're following these things because that is simply their destiny? They don't know how to please God, so that's simply part of their happiness and distress?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, now Kṛṣṇa is asking, "You give up this rascaldom." You do it. Don't go to the history. He says, "You give up." You give up. That's all. Then you are perfect. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Why you are going to the history? History may be something else, but now He says directly "Give up," you give up. That's all. Finish this business. Hm. That is... The point is clear now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question number four. Even a well read, widely traveled, and enlightened editor like the late Śrī Frank Moraes... I think that's how you... M-o-r-a-e-s. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't know. He's late though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> He has died, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's dead. He <span class="Italic">was</span> enlightened. "...equated Hindu ethos with castism." He equated that Hindu culture, or Hindu ethos, and castism is one and the same. "Will the fundamental values of Hinduism be in any way affected by the eradication of castism, towards which a concerted effort is now being made at all levels?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But it cannot be done. This is another foolishness. Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> But the difficulty is the caste system is coming on account of false notion that a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is the son of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is caste system. But Kṛṣṇa does not say. He says, "By quality and work." He never says, "By birth." So this so-called castism in India that is a false notion of <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ.</span> Real <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ</span> means <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> One must be qualified. And how one is qualified? That is also described. <span class="Italic">Satya śamo damo titikṣva ārjava jñānaṁ vijñānam āstikyam.</span> So there must be education. It is not that to abolish the caste system which is contaminated by false conception, or birth right conception. This wrong caste system should be abolished and training centers should be opened how to train a person to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or to become <span class="Italic">kṣatriya. Guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ.</span> So you cannot avoid it, but because you have misconceived the caste system, that should be abolished, and the system recommended by Kṛṣṇa, that should be taken. Otherwise you cannot avoid it. Caste system will remain. Just like truthfulness. So all over the world you'll find somebody who is truthful. Why do you take it: "His father was truthful, therefore he is truthful."? This is nonsense. This is nonsense. Kṛṣṇa never said that. The father may be Hiranyakasipu, but his son is Prahlāda. Or a son... Not that the, one has to become exactly like the father. It may be. There is every possibility, but it is not a fact that the son becomes like the father. It is not fact. So similarly, the first class man is truthful. Now, wherever you find a truthful man, you classify him as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is wanted. Why do you take that "Here is a son of truthful man; therefore he is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>"? That is misconception. You have to pick up the truthful men all over the world and classify them as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That we are doing. "If you follow these principles, no illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat-eating, you are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Come on." His father may be meat-eater or gambler or drunkard, but he is agreeing, "All right, come on, this come. You are welcome." Then it will be all right. You cannot abolish the truthful class of men. There are... You'll find truthful men everywhere. So you have to pick up. So Kṛṣṇa says that, <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā, guṇa-karma...</span> You pick up the quality of men and put them in the brahminical class, and then next, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> class, then <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> class, then <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> class. But you cannot abolish that system. That is a false attempt. Because more or less, there will be a class of men who are truthful. You cannot abolish. More or less, there will be a class of men who are sinful. So as soon as you want to pick up from a family, then it is mistake, miscalculated. That caste system should be abolished. But real classification... Not caste. It is classification. Intelligent class of men, or truthful class of men, the fighter class of men, that will continue all over the world. You cannot abolish it. Even if you abolish caste system in India, you cannot abolish the class of truthful men. That is not possible. In spite of so much degradation, a class of men will remain truthful, a class of men will remain sinful. More or less. You cannot abolish this. So this is false attempt. And this caste system is also false. It is not based on the right description of caste system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You're saying, rather, it's a classification according to the quality of a man's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is wanted. That must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And what will be the benefit of classifying men according to their qualities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Benefit will be then the whole thing will go in order. That is already described many times, that there must be brain, there must be arms, there must be belly, there must be legs for the complete composition of the body. If there is no brain, there is no head, then what is the use of these arms and legs and belly? It is all dead. So in the society, human society, if there is not a class of selected, truthful, honest, and so many brahminical qualifications, then society is ruined. Therefore they are perplexed. Everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Go to the factory. That's all. Go to the factory and bring money. And he is getting 25 dollars or 50 dollars daily and immediately purchasing wine and flat on Bowery Street. You'll produce such men, useless men, disturbing in the human society. You cannot make classless. If you make classless, naturally they will be all <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> fourth-class men. Then there will be society chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another part of this same question: if the <span class="Italic">harijanas,</span> who constitute a sizable population amongst the Hindus, are made to feel that their very religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all artificial. The <span class="Italic">harijana</span> word was used by Gandhi unnecessarily for a class of men who are not fit for the position. <span class="Italic">Harijana</span> means "the men of Hari." Just like Nārada. Nārada is called <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> Great devotee is called <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> "the persons related with Hari." But if you select some <span class="Italic">bhangis</span> and <span class="Italic">camaras</span> and keep them as he is and rubberstamp it, "Here is a <span class="Italic">harijana,</span>" what will be the effect? There is no harm to pick up a low class man and to elevate him to the position of <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> There is no impediment. You can do. But if you keep him a low class man and if you stamp him <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> then what will be benefit? Just like we are initiating selected men. "Are you ready to follow these rules and regulation? When he says, then "Come on. Become <span class="Italic">harijana.</span>" Not that "I'll keep myself in that same abominable condition of life and I shall become <span class="Italic">harijana.</span>" So this <span class="Italic">"harijana"</span> word has come from Gandhi. He did not try to make him real <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> He simply rubberstamped him. So what is the value of this <span class="Italic">harijana?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another section to this question. In other words, how can all sections of Hindus be made to take an equal interest and have the same sense of belonging to the Hindu religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you sticking to the Hindu religion? Any Hindu will accept <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and Kṛṣṇa. So why not ask them to take Kṛṣṇa? Why so-called Hinduism? Who is a Hindu who will deny the authority of Kṛṣṇa? Is he a Hindu? Every Hindu observes <span class="Italic">Janmāṣṭamī,</span> the birthday of Kṛṣṇa. So why do they not take Kṛṣṇa's advice and remain practically Hindu? They will not take advice of Kṛṣṇa, and they, how they can claim to be Hindu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So can all people have an equal interest in religion despite their different classifications?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That I have already explained, that any human civilized man, he has got some religion. So religion, basic principle of religion is with reference to God. So here is God, What God says, if you take that system, then it will be perfect, not only for the Hindus, for Christian, for Mohammedans, for everyone. And that is being practically done in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We have got devotees from all groups of human society and they are taking to it. It is practical. There is no difficulty. So Hindus, Muslims, Christian, everyone take to this Kṛṣṇa religion, Kṛṣṇite. Kṛṣṇian. (laughter) Not Christian, but Kṛṣṇian. The word <span class="Italic">christo</span> is also a Greek word. From this <span class="Italic">christo</span> the Christ has come. So instead of c-h-r-i, k-r-i, the same thing. Christian or Kṛṣṇian, or Christian. <span class="Italic">Krishta</span> is also another broken, I mean, another spelling of Kṛṣṇa. In India, if one's name is Kṛṣṇa, we say Krishta. My younger brother, his name was Kṛṣṇa. So we were calling him Krishta. So Krishta, Christian. So actually, if we take the root meaning, Christian means Krishnian or Krishtian. So that is a controversial point, but everyone can take to Kṛṣṇa. Then everything will be settled up. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. Make everything clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to go on, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next question: Swami Vivekananda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He had given a positive suggestion that one of the best ways for the <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> to command respect amongst all sections of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where Vivekananda was there when <span class="Italic">harijana</span> word was manufactured by Gandhi? At that time Vivekananda was not there. So why he's putting Vivekananda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Vivekananda has already died when this <span class="Italic">harijana</span> name...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Long, long ago. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's just using the word <span class="Italic">"harijana"</span> in place of <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or what was formerly "untouchables."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can use, but this <span class="Italic">"harijana"</span> word was manufactured by Gandhi. Vivekananda died some time, 1900... I do not exactly remember. When Gandhi's movement was not started. Gandhi's movement was started in 1917. And long ago Vivekananda expired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Anyway, his question is, "Swami Vivekananda has given a positive suggestion that one of the best ways for <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> to command respect among all sections of people is to learn Sanskrit, the study of which is being neglected even by <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> today. What incentives can be given to <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> to learn Sanskrit, the repository of Indian culture and religion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another misgiving. They will never be able to learn Sanskrit, and neither it is possible that by learning Sanskrit they will be elevated. There are many Sanskrit scholars. So how they are elevated? They are rotting. It is not a good suggestion, this. If the <span class="Italic">harijana</span> actually becomes <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> then it will benefit. That training we can give. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that we can make a <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> a so-called, I mean to say, <span class="Italic">camaras, bhangis...</span> Now they understand <span class="Italic">harijana</span> means he must be a <span class="Italic">camara</span> or <span class="Italic">bhangi.</span> But that is not the actual... <span class="Italic">harijana</span> means devotee, "The man of Hari." So in spite of their illiteracy in Sanskrit language, we can make him <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> actually. So why do you take the trouble of learning Sanskrit? Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">. Pāpa-yoni</span> means low-grade birth. So anyone. That includes the <span class="Italic">camaras, bhangis,</span> they can be purified if they take to the shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Because Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> The best thing is to induce them to come to Kṛṣṇa. Then they will be purified. And the simple method is recommended by Kṛṣṇa Himself and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, His incarnation: this <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Engage them in <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> movement which is being pushed by this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and they will be purified. They don't require to learn Sanskrit even. As he, it is. Let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and they will be purified. And if you want to teach them Sanskrit, it will take three thousand years. (laughter) That is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is a fact though that the repository of Indian culture and religion is Sanskrit. So are you saying then that the <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> or these class of people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is Sanskrit, but the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are received not by learning Sanskrit, but by hearing from the authorized person. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> It is in Sanskrit because there was no other language. Sanskrit was the only language. So now they're being translated into English. So it doesn't matter whether it is in Sanskrit or English, one has to learn it by hearing from the proper person. That is wanted. It is... The Vedic mantras are called <span class="Italic">śruti,</span> not Sanskriti. (laughter). It is called <span class="Italic">śruti. Śruti</span> means the first business is hearing. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is the purpose of going to guru? Means to, guru is the authorized person from hear..., from him hear. So it doesn't require that one has to learn Sanskrit. We have got so many disciples. It is not that they first of all learned Sanskrit. They heard. It may be in Sanskrit language or in English language. It doesn't matter. Let him hear the real fact. That is wanted. Although the Vedic <span class="Italic">mantras</span> are in Sanskrit, the process to understand is to hear. To hear it may be any language, to hear and understand, then he becomes perfect. It is not the Sanskrit language. It is the hearing which is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So will this bring respect...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śravanaṁ kīrtanaṁ viṣṇu.</span> Hear and chant about Viṣṇu. That is wanted. Not <span class="Italic">kṛn pratyaya, di-pratyaya, du-pratyaya.</span> No. That is not wanted. <span class="Italic">Na hi na hi rakṣati du-kṛn-kāraṇe.</span> This will not save you. If you have become a Sanskrit scholar, <span class="Italic">du-pratyaya, di-pratyaya, da-pratyaya,</span> that will not save you. <span class="Italic">Na hi na hi rakṣati dukṛn-kāraṇe, bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ mūḍha mate.</span> So this, they are thinking by learning Sanskrit they will become perfect. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> I don't find that "You learn Sanskrit, then you become perfect." "You surrender unto Me, then you become perfect." That is wanted. If you learn Sanskrit, there is no harm, but it is not the only condition that "You have to learn Sanskrit, then you will be able." Who knows in our camp Sanskrit? Who knows Sanskrit? How many?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Pradyumna.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may know little. (laughter) Sanskrit language... that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> His question here, Śrīla Prabhupāda, especially is that the <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> are very downtrodden...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Downtrodden, you keep them downtrodden. You manufacture wine and let them drink, and he will be uplifted. One side, (chuckles) you are manufacturing wine and advertising, "Come on, take here," and you remain, become <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> How it is possible? You must stop all this nonsense, the slaughterhouse, the liquor shop or the breweries or the prostitute quarter. You stop this. But that cannot be also stopped. Anyone who wants to become <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> he can become in spite of all these things. He can defend himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So should there be some effort?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that effort? Teach them Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, to make the <span class="Italic">harijanas</span> respectable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone can respectable. That is already described. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">. Kirāta-hūṇāndra-pulinda-pulkaśā ābhīra-śumbhā yavanāḥ khasādayaḥ.</span> Everyone can be, <span class="Italic">śudhyanti,</span> they can be purified. But if you take the real process, this is Kṛṣṇa consciousness process. Otherwise, simply by learning Sanskrit, what will be able...? There are so many big, big Sanskrit scholars in India. They are loitering in the street. Huh? What is that? You have met so many scholars. What is their position? That Prabhakara you know? He was my first student.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Ah, Prabhakara. Hm, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a big Sanskrit scholar. But what is his position? He got big, big position also, but he could not stay. If one's mind is not fixed up, you learn Sanskrit or no Sanskrit, it will.... [break] To make a good man, it is not necessary that one has to learn Sanskrit. He can be made good provided he fully surrenders to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ. Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana.</span> If one has got unflinching faith and devotion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then <span class="Italic">sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ.</span> All good qualities will develop automatically. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad guṇā.</span> If he's not a devotee, he will hover over the mental concoction. <span class="Italic">Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he'll remain in the material platform. Never mind he's a Sanskrit scholar or this or that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to hear another question, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is said that while the <span class="Italic">śrutis</span> embody the eternal truths of Hinduism, the <span class="Italic">smṛtis,</span> which embody the rules of conduct need to be revised according to the dictates of the changing times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will such a stand be acceptable to all sections of Hindus, and if so, how can the new <span class="Italic">smṛtis</span> come into being and who will give them sanction and sanctity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The authority will give. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He is giving authority. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> is giving authority. But in this age, Kali-yuga, it is full of faults, the ocean of faults. And Śukadeva Gosvāmī is giving direction,</div>
<div class="Verse">kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann<br class="calibre2"/>hy asti eko mahān guṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya<br class="calibre2"/>mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>12.3.51]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So although in this age there are so many faults, it is like the ocean of fault, but still there is one very great advantage, that simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> one becomes purified. So this <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> injunction we should take up, and actually we see all over the world how it is purifying all section of people. So take this, then <span class="Italic">śruti smṛti...</span> Ah...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Purāṇadi?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, everything will be fulfilled. The easiest method. <span class="Italic">Kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the <span class="Italic">śrutis</span> are eternally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śruti,</span> it is based on <span class="Italic">śruti. Śabdad anavrtti.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> Simply by chanting, <span class="Italic">śabdat, brahma, śabda brahma. Śabdad anavṛtti,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> By chanting the holy name of Lord, one can become liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">smṛtis</span> are based on the <span class="Italic">śrutis?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">smṛti... Bhagavad-gītā</span> is considered <span class="Italic">smṛti.</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also says: <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">. Śruti-smṛti-purāṇadi</span> [BRS 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">. Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa: Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma eva kevalam</span> [Ādi 17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> And it is practiced by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-varṇaṁ tviṣākṛṣṇaṁ sāṅgopāṅgāstra-pārṣadam [SB </span>11.5.32]<span class="Italic">. Kṛṣṇaṁ varṇayati.</span> Always chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. So these are the evidences. So introduce this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Everyone will be purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> more than just rules of conduct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Smṛti</span> means... The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are considered as, taken as <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> But simply by hearing one cannot understand. Therefore <span class="Italic">smṛtis,</span> they have explained. <span class="Italic">Purayati iti purāṇa.</span> Complete. The Vedic <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is not always understood. Just like the Vedānta <span class="Italic">mantra, janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> This is very short cut. But <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> explains, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñaḥ svarāṭ.</span> Explanation. The <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> is explanation. So either you take <span class="Italic">śruti</span> or <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> subject matter is the same. But these are the evidences. <span class="Italic">Śruti-smṛti-purāṇādi-pāñcarātriki-vidhiṁ vinā</span> [BRS 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot be purified or become actually God conscious without reference to the <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti.</span> We are pushing on this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, it is not whimsically. It is based on <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti-pāñcarātriki-vidhi.</span> Therefore it is becoming effective.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it necessary from time to time to change the <span class="Italic">smṛtis?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That cannot be changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Smṛti</span> cannot be changed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nothing can be changed. But according to the time you have to... Just like in Kali-yuga the <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> order is <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ paraṁ vrajet [SB </span>12.3.51]<span class="Italic">.</span> So you have to do this. Just like a physician gives a medicine that "Morning you take this medicine, in the evening you take this medicine." It is not a change of treatment. It is according to the time a different medicine. But it is recommended by the physician, not by your whims. <span class="Italic">Śruti-smṛti</span> cannot be changed, but they have recommended different process in different times. So the reference to the <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti</span> is there, authority is there. It is... You cannot modify.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is no question then of, as he says, "new <span class="Italic">smṛti.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. New <span class="Italic">smṛti,</span> they may take it, "new <span class="Italic">smṛti.</span>" But <span class="Italic">smṛti</span> is <span class="Italic">smṛti.</span> It is not new. You have to give reference to the past <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti.</span> Otherwise, it is not... <span class="Italic">Veda pramāṇa, śabda pramāṇa.</span> Otherwise there is no evidence. It is invalid, not valid. You cannot change the original <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti,</span> but you have to take the timely recommendation. Just like Kṛṣṇa Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāmaiva kevalam, kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva nāsty eva...</span> [Ādi 17.21]. This is the only method. You take it. But this is <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti-pramāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then they say that if this is the method, then how does Deity worship fit into the scheme?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can avoid even Deity worship, but you cannot avoid chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Their idea is to abolish Deity worship. They consider it antiquated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want... If you want... Why you should try to avoid this? That means you are disregarding the <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti.</span> But that is not the policy, that you should avoid it. But if you..., it is not possible... Just like it is not possible to introduce the Deity worship everywhere, anywhere. It doesn't matter. You chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. It is not avoiding. It is the circumstance that does not make very favorable. Just like I did not introduce the Deity worship in the beginning. That was not possible. But when there is favorable condition we introduced. That is not avoidance. That is conditional. But especially chanting, that is possible in any condition of life. That is possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So there's no question then, as he says, of bringing new <span class="Italic">smṛtis</span> which would come into being if someone would give them sanction and authority. The position as you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But there cannot be new <span class="Italic">smṛtis.</span> We are giving the sanction to Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> because it is already there in the <span class="Italic">śruti.</span> But for this time it is suitable. I am taking a certain type of medicine in the evening, it is already recommended by the physician. I am not doing it whimsically. So whimsically you cannot change. It must have reference to the <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti-purāṇadi</span> [BRS 1.2.101]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can anyone change...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...the rules of conduct as regarded in the <span class="Italic">smṛtis?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody can change. Nobody can change. But rules and regulation for different times, different circumstances are there in the <span class="Italic">śruti-smṛti.</span> We have to take it. You cannot change.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And who will sanction that application?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He said. He's authority. He's <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> must sanction for the particular time and place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are following the footprints of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. It is not whimsical. You have to follow the authority in all circumstances. You cannot avoid. That is illegal. It will have no power. Just like all of a sudden you make a low class man a <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> It will not stay. But you can make <span class="Italic">harijana</span> any class of man provided you adopt the proper means.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think one more question then would be appropriate because it kind of ties in which this last question. "Number seven: Hinduism has always renewed or revitalized itself according to the need of the times. In today's context, are any correctives called for, and if so, who will bring them about and how can they be brought about and made acceptable to all the masses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, who will take it? Kṛṣṇa has given already according to the time, He has summarized the whole Vedic scripture in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but who is taking it? And Caitanya Mahāprabhu and all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they have explained how to accept Kṛṣṇa consciousness or Kṛṣṇa's instruction. So first thing you must be ready to take the presentation according to the time and circumstances. Then everything will be all right. If you manufacture your own way of life, if you do not take it from the authority, then it will be failure. Just like this <span class="Italic">harijana.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The condition is that "those who take shelter unto Me." Now, Mahatma Gandhi manufactured the <span class="Italic">harijana,</span> but where there is the teaching that "You take shelter of Kṛṣṇa?"

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> "It is clearly declared here by the Supreme Lord that in devotional service there is no distinction between the lower or higher clases of people. In the material conception of life there are such divisions, but for a person engaged in transcendental devotional service to the Lord there are not. Everyone is eligible for the supreme destination. In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> it is stated that even the lowest, who are called <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas,</span> dog-eaters, can be elevated by association with a pure devotee. Therefore devotional service and guidance of a pure devotee are so strong that there's no discrimination between the lower and higher classes of men. Anyone can take to it. The most simple man, taking center of the pure devotee, can be purified by proper guidance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The guidance means how to take him to Kṛṣṇa's shelter. Then he will be all right. The guidance is wrong, no question of Kṛṣṇa, and he, simply by rubberstamping, "Here is a <span class="Italic">harijana,</span>" how it will be effective? Therefore it is failure. He remains the same drunkard, same meat-eater, and he becomes <span class="Italic">harijana.</span> How it is possible? The guidance required. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">.</span> He must be guided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You started this explanation by saying, "But who will take it?" So is this to say that this religion that you're speaking of is not trying to be made acceptable to the masses, or is it only for those who will take it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Unless you take it, where is question of religion? So that requires guidance. Just like to make a child educated, there is teacher required. Automatically how he can...? A child, now you give him a rubberstamp, "Now you are MA." Is he MA? He must be guided to pass the MA examination, then he'll be, he's MA. And "Because he is born in a certain family, he cannot be MA," that is not the fact. He can be MA provided the guidance is there, training is there. He can become MA. It doesn't matter that because he is lowborn he cannot become MA. No. He can become. The training is how to take shelter of Kṛṣṇa. Then he goes back to home, back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It appears from his question that his idea is that Hinduism is so flexible that whatever condition of life the masses are in, Hinduism will kind of envelop them, and they can still call themselves Hindus.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have already refuted. There is no such thing as Hinduism in the Vedic conception. It is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> or <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> so wide that everyone can be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sanātana</span> means eternal. So <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> The identification of the living entity is already described, that it does not perish after annihilation of this body. That is <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span> So that is meant for everyone. Not that the Hindus, after giving up this body, exist, and the Muslim or Christian does not exist. Everyone exists. Everyone is eternal, so <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> is meant for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is there anyone actually outside of <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he thinks. Otherwise nobody is outside. If you think that you are not... There are so many rascals, they think that with the body everything is finished. But he may think so, but that is not fact. Similarly, if one thinks that "I am not <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharmi,</span> I am Christian." You may think like that, but actually you are sanatanist. But if you think otherwise, you can think. Who can check it? When Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">,</span> the soul does not annihilate after the destruction of the body, is it meant for the Hindus?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is question number eight for this Bhavan's Journal, Bombay. We've covered the first seven questions. The eighth question, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is "In the Kali-yuga, <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> has been described as the most suitable and easiest of paths for God realization. Yet how is it that Vedantic teachings, with their accent on <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> are being given the pride of place by noted savants or knowers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The so-called Vedantists are bluffers. They do not know what is Vedānta. But the things are going on that people want to be bluffed and the bluffers take advantage of it, and therefore... <span class="Italic">Veda</span> means knowledge, and <span class="Italic">anta</span> means end of knowledge. That is the combination of Vedānta. So in the Vedānta the beginning is, <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, athāto brahma jijñāsāḥ.</span> "Now, in the human form of life, they should inquire about the Absolute Truth." That is the Vedānta philosophy. And what is that Absolute Truth? <span class="Italic">Sūtra</span> means in aphorism, in small words, a big philosophy is given. That is called <span class="Italic">sūtra.</span> A little link. So <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> begins when one is inquisitive to understand the Absolute Truth. That is called <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> And it is answered, first question is now about <span class="Italic">brahma-jijñāsa,</span> inquisitive, inquiry about Brahman. So Brahman is, in nutshell, described: "Brahman means the origin of everything." <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> All the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> all the book of knowledge, their business is how to search out God. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> So the whole Vedānta is description of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. But because in this Kali-yuga people will not be able to study Vedānta nicely on account of lack of education, therefore Vyāsadeva personally wrote a commentary on the Vedānta. That commentary is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Bhāṣyaṁ brahma-sūtrānam</span><i class="calibre3"> **<span class="Italic"></span></i>. The <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the real commentary on the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> written by the author himself. The <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> is also given by Vyāsadeva, and under the instruction of Nārada, his spiritual master... Get this light on. He wrote commentary on the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also begins with the same aphorism, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ anvayād itarataś ca artheṣu abhijñāh sva-rāṭ [SB 1.1.1].</span> So actually, <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> is explained by the author of the Vedānta in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> So some rascals, without understanding Vedānta, without reading the commentary, natural commentary of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> they are posing themselves as Vedantist. That means they are misguiding people. And because people are not educated, they're accepting these rascals as Vedantists. Actually, the so-called Vedantists, they are bluffers. They are not Vedantists. They do not know anything of the Vedānta. That is the difficulty. Otherwise, what is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> that is real Vedānta. In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">jīvasya tattva-jijñāsa.</span> That is <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sutra-bhāṣya.</span> Find out this verse.</div>

That is the... And now they should learn from this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement what is <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> and what is the explanation of <span class="Italic">Vedānta.</span> Then they will be benefited. If we take <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> as the real commentary on <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra,</span> then we'll find that in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, kaler doṣa-nidhe rājann asti hy eko mahān guṇaḥ.</span> In this Kali-yuga, which is the ocean of all faults, there is one benediction, opportunity.

Otherwise Vyāsadeva has given already what is <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> explanation. This is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Let them read the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> They will understand what is Vedānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that to say that the conclusion of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sutra</span> and the conclusion of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is one and the same. <span class="Italic">Bhakti.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra, <i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> Here it is same thing explained, that don't be entrapped with these temporary bodily necessities of life, sense gratification. You must inquire about the Absolute Truth. In the next verse it is explained, <span class="Italic">vadanti tat tattva-vidas tattvaṁ yaj jñānam</span> [SB 1.2.11]<span class="Italic">. Tattva.

That is the purpose of <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can I ask another question, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Yes. The Vedantists they have come from the impersonal explanation of Śaṅkarācārya. <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya.</span> But they simply give stress on the <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya,</span> but there are other <span class="Italic">bhāṣyas. Bhāṣyas</span> means commentary. And the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the natural commentary by the author himself. Besides that, there are <span class="Italic">Vedānta-bhāṣyas</span> written by the Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, and all the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Unfortunately, they do not care to read all these <span class="Italic">Vedānta-bhāṣyas.</span> They simply take <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya</span> and become impersonalist and call themselves as Vedantist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the reason for that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reason means people do not know. They cheat. Suppose I present something, a misconception, and if there are others also who can speak something on the... There are two lawyers. One is speaking one point of law, another lawyer is speaking. So if you take one side only, then how you will understand? So they are simply reading this <span class="Italic">Śārīraka-bhāṣya.</span> They are not reading other <span class="Italic">bhāṣyas,</span> just like the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> which is natural. And they are cheating people. That's all. Why there are two lawyers? Two opposite parties, there are two lawyers. One lawyer says this law is like this, and the other party says, "No, it is this." And the judge is there, he will take what is the real meaning. But this interpretation is required when things are not clear. Now the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> says, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> "The Absolute Truth is that from whom everything comes in, emanates." Now, here is... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa said that <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Clearly. That "I am the origin of everything, and everything comes from Me." So why don't you take it? Why simply you remain theoretically understood that Absolute Truth is that from which everything emanates. But when the Absolute Truth comes before you and says that "I am the origin of everything. Everything comes from Me." Why don't you accept Kṛṣṇa as Absolute Truth? Why do you take the so-called impersonalist view only, that God has no form? Here is God speaking, person. Why don't you take it? If you want to be cheated, then who can stop you? Here Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca...</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedānta-kṛd,</span> I am the compiler of Vedānta. Why these rascals do not take who compiled Vedānta? Vyāsadeva is the incarnation of God. He compiled Vedānta. Why he does not take the original Vedantist. Here it is clearly stated, <span class="Italic">vedānta-kṛd.</span> Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Translation: I am seated in everyone's heart and from Me comes remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they do not go to the compiler of Vedānta. They go to a rascal. How they will understand Vedānta? Suppose I have written this book. If you cannot understand something, if you come directly to me, that is real. Why do you go to a rascal who has nothing to do with this book? If some rascal claims that "I am Vedanti," so your description should... Why shall I not go to the real compiler of Vedānta. Why shall I go to a rascal? That means they are rascals. They are being cheated. Let them take to <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and let them take to <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> They will understand Vedānta. They're real Vedantist. But these rascals, they're avoiding <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and avoiding <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> and claiming themselves as Vedantist. So if you go to a cheater you'll be cheated. That is your business. Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "The Supreme Lord is situated as Paramātmā in everyone's heart and it is from Him that all activities are initiated. The living entity forgets everything of his past life, but he has to act according to the direction of the Supreme Lord, who is witness to all his work. Therefore he begins his work according to his past deeds. Required knowledge is supplied to him and remembrance is given to him and he forgets also about his past life. Thus the Lord is not only all-pervading, He is also localized in every individual heart. He awards the different fruitive results. He is not only worshipable as the impersonal Brahman, the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the localized Paramātmā, but as the form of the incarnation of the Vedas as well. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give the right direction to the people so that they can properly mold their lives and come back to Godhead, back to home. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> offer knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa, and Kṛṣṇa in His incarnation as Vyāsadeva is the compiler of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> The commentation of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sutra</span> by Vyāsadeva in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> gives the real understanding of the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra.</span> The Supreme Lord is so full that for the deliverance of the conditioned soul, He is the supplier and the digester of foodstuff, the witness of his activity, the giver of knowledge in the form of <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and as the Supreme Personality of Godhead Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the teacher of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> He is worshipable by the conditioned soul. Thus God is all good, God is all-merciful. <span class="Italic">Anantaḥ praviṣṭaḥ śaṣṭa janānam.</span> The living entity forgets as soon as he quits his present body, but he begins his work again initiated by the Supreme Lord. Although he forgets, the Lord gives him the intelligence to renew his work where he ended his last life. So not only does a living entity enjoy or suffer in this world according to the dictation from the Supreme Lord situated locally in the heart, but he receives the opportunity to understand <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> from Him. If one is serious to understand the Vedic knowledge, then Kṛṣṇa gives the required intelligence. Why does he present the Vedic knowledge for understanding? Because a living entity individually needs to understand Kṛṣṇa. Vedic literature confirms this. <span class="Italic">Yo'sau sarvair vedair gīyate.</span> In all Vedic literature, beginning from the four <span class="Italic">Vedas, Vedānta-sūtra</span> and the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> and <span class="Italic">Purāṇas,</span> the glories of the Supreme Lord are celebrated. By performing Vedic rituals, discussing the Vedic philosophy and worshiping the Lord in devotional service, He is attained. Therefore the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is to understand Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> give us direction to understand Kṛṣṇa and the process of understanding. The ultimate goal is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> confirms this in the following words: <span class="Italic">tat tu samanvayāt.</span> One can attain perfection by understanding Vedic literature, and one can understand his relationship with the Supreme Personality of Godhead by performing the different processes. Thus one can approach Him and at the end attain the supreme goal, who is no other than the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this verse, however, the purpose of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> the understanding of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and the goal of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are clearly defined."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He clearly says, <span class="Italic">vedānta-kṛd.</span> "I am the compiler of..." So why one should go to learn Vedānta from others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> How does <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> tie into the Vedantic, the conclusion of Vedantic knowledge or wisdom? He says here that <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the most suitable and easiest path of God realization. This is proclaimed, but the Vedantic teachings... He says in the Vedantic teaching the stress is on <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> Is that a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñāna,</span> what is <span class="Italic">jñāna? Jñāna</span> means... That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So unless one surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, there is no <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> This is all nonsense. And they're passing as <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> There is no knowledge at all. Vedānta means the ultimate knowledge. So ultimate knowledge, the subject matter of ultimate knowledge is Kṛṣṇa, God. So if one does not know who is God, who is Kṛṣṇa, then where is knowledge? This is fact, the knowledge, but if a rascal claims that "I am man of knowledge," then what can be done? Knowledge is explained, that when one understands that Kṛṣṇa is everything.... <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one understands that Vasudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is everything, then that is knowledge. Before that, there is no knowledge. It is simply misunderstanding. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> One may begin with impersonal Brahman by the speculative method or one can realize the, what is called, Paramātmā, localized aspect. That is the secondary stage. The final stage is understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyam</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the final knowledge. But if you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, then where is your knowledge? Knowledge, half-way knowledge is not knowledge. Complete knowledge. That complete knowledge is possible, as it is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are striving to acquire knowledge, such persons, after many, many births, when actually by the grace of God and by the grace of a devotee comes to the knowledge, then he agrees, "Oh, <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> everything is Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā,</span> that <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> great soul is very rare to be found. <span class="Italic">Sudurlabhaḥ. Durlabhaḥ</span> means very rare to be seen but the word is used <span class="Italic">sudurlabhaḥ,</span> very, very rare. So you cannot find such a <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> who understands clearly Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye, yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin... [Bg. 7.3]. Siddha</span> means liberated. So one may become liberated even that.... but from that liberated position again he falls down unless he understands the Supreme Person, Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Aruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless he comes to the final understanding of the Absolute Truth, Kṛṣṇa, he'll fall down. Therefore so many Vedantists, they first of all, they give up this world <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,</span> this world is false. But again they come down and they become busy in doing some philanthropic work, opening hospitals.... Why? If the world is false, why you are coming down again on this platform? That means they could not get any substance by their so-called renouncement of this world. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa,</span> for going to that platform of <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> liberation, they had to undergo so much difficulties and austerities but still, even going there.... Just like these people are going to the moon planet and.... Actually whether they have gone or not, that is a doubtful thing, but the thing is, why they are coming down again? That is our challenge. If you have gone to the moon planet then colonise there. But why you have come down again and do not talk anything about. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmatīrtha:</span> Well I couldn't say. They've been there they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say, you believe, but we are common man, lay man, we say that if you have gone there, why you do not live there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmatīrtha:</span> Yes, they just bring back rocks to show us, we have rocks here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is rock, if there is sand, then why don't you colonise there? What is their answer? If there is same sand, same rock there, then why not... [break] ...some money and can bring some sand and bluff people that you have gone to moon planet. And people are satisfied, they're paying for another excursion to the Mars. This is going on. If you have gone there, there is land. If you fly in the sky and if you get a land then you can stay there. And because you cannot stay there, you come back again. So their... The Māyāvādīs position is there, <span class="Italic">āruhya kṛcchreṇa param,</span> they merge into the impersonal Brahman but there is no place to stay, they come down again to this material world. You may go many thousands and millions of miles in the sky but you want to stay somewhere. But if you cannot get any place to stay then again you come to this Moscow and New York. So our enquiry is that if you have gone there, then why don't you stay there? What is the answer? Hm? Kīrtanānanda Maharaj?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> They say the atmosphere is not suitable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why rascal, you go there? (laughter) And spend so much money, rascal? You could not understand the atmosphere is not good for us, go there and spend so much money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmatīrtha:</span> They impress the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are bluffer and they bluffing the all fools and rascals. That's all. He could not understand before going there, before spending so much money the atmosphere is not good?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But without personal, direct experience they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For your direct whims you have to spend so much money? The people are so befooled they do not challenge them. Yes. Everyone knows, suppose one is coming to the western country, Europe and America, we knew it, that it is cold country, we must take proper dress. And we have come and we are staying. So this is knowledge. So if you do not know what is the atmosphere there, what do you spend so much money? And again you are going to the Mars. Are you fixed up what is the position there? Then you'll again bring something, some dust and rock. (laughter) This business will go on at the expense of the... You can do. You have got money. You can do that. But we are Indians, we are coming from poor country. If you spend so much money for nothing, that is very, not very palatable for us. If one tenth of the expenditure you would have given to us for spreading this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement... No. Not a single <span class="Italic">paisa</span> they will give. And they'll spoil money for going to the moon planet and bring some dust. That's ... Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja is struggling to construct a small residential quarter here, and he has to beg, he has to collect, he has done... Why the government does not pay? "Here so many people are living. Let them live comfortably." But they'll spend this money, millions of dollars, and to bring some dust. Is that very sane government? And people are so fool that they do not challenge the government, "Why you are spending for nothing?" They can do that. They brought back Nixon. Why not stop this unnecessary expenditure? Hm? Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kīrtanānanda:</span> It makes perfect sense, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. For nothing. And it is sure certainly you can write down, their Mars going also will be failure. Let it, you take in writing. I may die. I am old man. Take it down. It will be failure. I told ten years before that "It is childish." One press reporter inquired in San Francisco, what is your... "No, this is childish, wasting money." The reporter came to see me in Los Angeles. He remembered that. If you want to spend for nothing like that, you can do that. You have got money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmatīrtha:</span> If you say to a politician, "Give Śrīla Prabhupāda money..." Like I said to one man running for governor of this state, I said, "Why can't you help the community in New Vrindaban?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmatīrtha:</span> He cited to me so many rules and regulations. They're not interested. They're interested in pleasing themselves. A man runs for government, his whole position to run for governor is to please himself so that he can become rich.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it. Here, you are right. Sense gratification. Nobody wants to do anything. Nixon captured the presidential post for his own satisfaction. And when the people found that "Here is a trick," they agitated and got him down. So this is the difficulty, that <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās the 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are blind and we are being guided by blind men. So the result is catastrophe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can I ask another question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? Question number nine. Is a guru essential to one to enter the spiritual path and attain the goal, and how does one recognize one's guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is explained, that guru is necessary. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> when Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna were talking as friend, there was no conclusion. The talking was going on but no conclusion was made. Therefore Arjuna decided to accept Kṛṣṇa as his guru. Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Kārpaṇya-doṣopahata-svabhāvaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking you to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am your disciple and a soul surrendered unto you. Please instruct me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore guru is necessary. Everyone is perplexed. Nobody can decide himself. Even a physician, a medical man, when he is sick, he does not make his own treatment. He calls for another physician because he is sick, his brain is not in order. How he can prescribe the real medicine for himself? That is natural. So similarly, when we are perplexed, bewildered, we cannot make any solution, at that time the right person, guru, is required. It is essential. You cannot avoid it. So in our present existence we are all perplexed. Arjuna is representating the perplexed position of the materialistic person. And we are actually all perplexed. So under the circumstances, to give us real direction a guru is required. Now, here is the example that Arjuna decided Kṛṣṇa as guru. He did not go to anyone else to accept as guru. The explanation is there. Find out. <span class="Italic">Na hi prapaśyāmi.</span> "Without you I don't find anybody..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Na hi prapaśyāmi mamāpanudyād yac chokam ucchoṣaṇam indriyāṇām, avāpya bhūmāv asapatnam ṛddhaṁ rājyaṁ surāṇām api cādhipatyam</span> [Bg. 2.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Um, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Seeing Arjuna full of compassion and very sorrowful, his eyes brimming with tears, Madhusūdana, Kṛṣṇa, spoke the following words."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One translation of every verse, go on, read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "The Supreme Person Bhagavān said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy. O son of Pṛthā, do not yield to this degrading impotence. It does not become you. Give up such petty weakness of heart and arise, O chastiser of the enemy. Arjuna said: O killer of Madhu, Kṛṣṇa, how can I counteract with arrows in battle men like Bhīṣma and Droṇa who are worthy of my worship? It is better to live in this world by begging than to live at the cost of the lives of great souls who are my teachers. Even though they are avaricious, they are nonetheless superiors. If they are killed, our spoils will be tainted with blood. Nor do we know which is better, conquering them or being conquered by them. The sons of Dhṛtarāṣṭra, whom if we killed we should not care to live, are now standing before us on this battlefield. Now I am confused about my duty and have lost all composure because of weakness. In this condition I am asking You to tell me clearly what is best for me. Now I am your disciple and a soul surrendered unto You. Please instruct me. I can find no means to drive away this grief which is drying up my senses. I will not be able to destroy it even if I win an unrivalled kingdom on the earth with sovereignty like that of the demigods in heaven. Sañjaya said: Having thus spoken, Arjuna the chastiser of the enemies told Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, I shall not fight, and fell silent. O descendant of Bhārata, at that time, Kṛṣṇa, smiling in the midst of both the armies spoke the following words to the griefstricken Arjuna."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he has said already that "I do not find any other means to pacify me, and You are the only..." The purport is that Arjuna is accepting Kṛṣṇa as guru to instruct him how to get relief from the perplexed position. So in this sense the real guru is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is guru. Not only for Arjuna, for everyone. So if we take instruction from Kṛṣṇa and abide by that order, instruction, then our life is successful. That is our mission. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means accept Kṛṣṇa as guru. We don't say... Don't divert your attention. We don't say that "I am Kṛṣṇa." We never say that. We simply ask people that "You abide by the order of Kṛṣṇa." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> and we say that "You surrender to Kṛṣṇa. Give up all other ideas of so-called <span class="Italic">dharma</span> or religiosity." The same thing. But we don't say that you or me, "I am the authority." No, we don't say that. We say, "Kṛṣṇa is the authority, and you try to understand Kṛṣṇa." This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Therefore the question is guru. So here, from the behavior of Arjuna, we see that guru is necessary. Arjuna was talking with Kṛṣṇa as friend, but Arjuna saw that "This is, there is no good talking like this. We can continue talking.... Because we are equal status. Kṛṣṇa is my friend. I am also His friend. So He's answering, I am giving something. If this talking will go on, there will be no fruit." Therefore he said, "Now, Kṛṣṇa, I am becoming Your disciple." Disciple means there is no argument. Whatever the guru will say, you have to accept. That is disciple. That is final. There is no argument. So Arjuna put him into that position that "I cease to talk with You on equal level of friends. Now I accept You as guru." Therefore the guru is necessary, undoubtedly, because every one of us in perplexed position. But who is guru? Guru means Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative. And all others are bogus. If one does not say on the standard of Kṛṣṇa, then he's not guru. He's a bogus. In that way everyone can become guru. I have got some opinion, I can say. But unless.... Just like a lawyer is he who follows the standard law. If a lawyer says that "I have manufactured my own laws," so who will hear him? And what will be the use of becoming lawyer? No. You have to follow the standard law. Then you are a lawyer. And a big lawyer means who knows the standard laws very well. Similarly, guru is Kṛṣṇa and guru is necessary. But one must surrender to Kṛṣṇa or Kṛṣṇa's representative. Then he will be successful. So so far.... Now, one can say that Kṛṣṇa is not present. But Kṛṣṇa is not present, how you can say? Kṛṣṇa's instruction is there, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> How you can say that.... Kṛṣṇa, absolute, means the Supreme Lord is not different from His words also. The words of Kṛṣṇa and the Kṛṣṇa, they are the same. That is Absolute Truth. In the relative world the words "water" and the substance water are different. If I am thirsty, if I simply chant "water, water, water," my thirst will not be satisfied. I require the real water. That is relative world. But in the spiritual world.... Just like we are chanting Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa. If Kṛṣṇa is different from Hare Kṛṣṇa, then how we are satisfied chanting whole day and night? This is the proof. The ordinary thing, if you chant, "Mr. John, Mr. John," after chanting three times you'll cease. But this Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> if you go on chanting 24 hours, you'll never be tired. this is the spiritual Absolute Truth. That is practical. Anyone can perceive. So Kṛṣṇa's present by His words, by His representative. Why don't you take? You have to take guru. Why do you go to the pseudo guru who will mislead you? Why don't you take to the real guru? That is your mistake. Therefore you are now disappointed. Now you are in doubt whether guru is needed. Yes, guru is needed, but you go to the real guru. That is instruction in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Just find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti tad-jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is guru. What, is that? One who has seen the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one who has seen... Just like Arjuna has seen Kṛṣṇa. That's a fact. He was talking. How that if you take instruction of Arjuna, then you understand. So what is the instruction of Arjuna? Find out in the Tenth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">arjuna uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma<br class="calibre2"/>pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam<br class="calibre2"/>ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.12]</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> says, <span class="Italic">athāto brahma jijñāsaḥ.</span> Now here Arjuna is experienced, "You are the Supreme Brahman." So he has seen the Supreme Brahman. So you make Arjuna guru, Kṛṣṇa guru. Arjuna is representative of Kṛṣṇa, friend of Kṛṣṇa. So why do you go to a bogus guru? You must be cheated. Guru is essential. It is necessary. But take the real guru. But if you go to the bogus guru, you must be disappointed. For your treatment you need to go to a physician. That's all. When you are diseased you cannot say, "No, no, I don't want to..." It <span class="Italic">is</span> necessary. But go to the real physician. Don't go to a cheater. He has no knowledge in the medical science, and he places himself as "I am physician, MD." Then you'll be cheated. The guru is necessary, that's a fact. But go to the real guru. Who is real guru? Real guru is Kṛṣṇa or one who has seen Kṛṣṇa, Arjuna. Take them. Then you'll be benefitted. And if you go to a bogus man who does not know Kṛṣṇa, who does not know what is Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then you must be cheated. So the answer is guru is absolute necessary. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is Vedic injunction, that one must go. But he must go to the real guru. And who is real guru? Who knows Kṛṣṇa. Take, for example, Arjuna, how he studied Kṛṣṇa. And he says, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Read the translation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Arjuna said: You are the Supreme Brahman, the ultimate, the supreme abode and purifier, the Absolute Truth and the eternal divine person. You are the primal God, transcendental and original, and You are the unborn and all pervading beauty. All the great sages such as Nārada, Asita, Devala, and Vyāsa, proclaim this of You and now You Yourself are declaring it to me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arjuna is rectifying this because people may say, "Arjuna was Kṛṣṇa's friend, he is accepting Him as guru." No, Arjuna says, "Not only I, but other authorities, they also accept." So it is..., everything is clear, that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and He should be accepted as guru or His representative should be accepted guru. Then it will be... So our, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that we are presenting Kṛṣṇa as the supreme guru. You take instruction from Him and be benefited. But one who is carrying this message, he is also authorized. Just like one money order, it is coming through the post office, but an ordinary peon is handing over the money. But he is representative of post office. Actually, the money order is being delivered by the post office, general post office. But it is coming through an ordinary peon. But because he is authorized to deliver you, he is also post office. He's as good as the post office. Just you have got a letter box, a small box, but if you put your letter there, your letter will surely go ten thousand miles away. Therefore, although it is a small box, you don't think it is small box. It is whole post office. Similarly, anyone who is carrying the message of Kṛṣṇa, don't think that he's ordinary man. If you imitate one box like that post box and put your letter, for thousand years it will lie down there. Because it is not authorized. So if somebody says this small box, red box, is as good as the post office, one may say, "Huh, this is small box. How it can be as good as the post office?" But you see. You post your letter, it will go. Therefore, <span class="Italic">sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstrair uktas tathā bhāvyata eva sadbhiḥ **.</span> Guru is directly the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Why? Because he is presenting the words of Supreme Personality of Godhead without any deterioration. Therefore he is so honored. So therefore the conclusion is guru is necessary and guru is he who is representative of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise he's bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the so-called gurus that take a little bit here and a little bit there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So-called gurus, they are so-called gurus. They are not gurus. That is already explained. If one does not speak what Kṛṣṇa speaks, he is not guru. If you accept so-called guru, that is your misfortune. What can be done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Some of them will say some things that Kṛṣṇa says, but they'll take from other places also. What is the position of such persons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's most dangerous. He's most dangerous. He is opportunist. He's finding out customer, something here... According to the customer he is giving something, as the customers will be pleased. So he is not guru. He's a servant. He wants to serve the so-called disciples so that he may be satisfied and pay him something. He's servant. He's not guru. Guru is the master. You cannot disobey guru. But if you become a servant, you want to please the disciple by flattering him to get his money, then you are not guru, you are servant. Just like a servant pleases the master. He's not guru. He's servant. So our position should be servant, yes, but servant of the Supreme. So guru means heavy. You cannot utilize him for satisfying your whims. That is not guru. (pause) Now? What other question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's about eight o'clock, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Should we go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Tomorrow. (devotees offer obeisances-break)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we're continuing with this questionnaire from Bhavan's Journal in Bombay. This is question number ten. Question number ten, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is "Will <span class="Italic">mantras</span> lose their sanctity if they are not in Sanskrit?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Will <span class="Italic">mantras</span> lose their sanctity or holiness if they are not in the Sanskrit language?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mantra</span> in Sanskrit language, it may... The letters may be different, but it is a transcendental sound. The sound must be vibrated. You cannot translate it. The sound as it is... Just like Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> the sound must be produced. You cannot translate. Then it will be <span class="Italic">artha, arthavad.</span> That is prohibited. You cannot interpret or do other way... The sound vibration must be there. Then it will continue in sanctity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that to say the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> can be written in Devanāgarī script or in Roman letters, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the sound must be the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The sound is important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the sanctity is in the sound vibration and not so much that it's in the Sanskrit letters itself. May I ask another question, Śrīla Prabhupāda? "Are fasting and other dietary regulations necessary for leading a spiritual life?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Certainly.</div>
<div class="Verse">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>śamena damena va<br class="calibre2"/>tyāgena sattva-śaucābhyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yamena niyamena vā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.13]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">To advance in spiritual life these things are essential, <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> means voluntarily accepting something which may be painful. Just like we are recommending no illicit sex, no gambling, no meat-eating. So those who are accustomed to these bad habits, for them, in he beginning it may be a little difficult. But in spite of becoming difficult, one has to do it. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> To rise early in the morning, those who are not practiced, it is a little painful, but one has to do it. So this is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> So according to the Vedic injunction, there are some <span class="Italic">tapasyas</span> that must be done. It is not, "I may do it or not do it." It must be done. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</span> it is ordered that one must go to the spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no question of voluntarily, but it must be. And one must carry out by the order of a spiritual master and the order of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Just like in our line <span class="Italic">ekādaśī</span> is compulsory. One may feel some inconvenience fasting or simply eating fruits. No. It must be done. There are so many rules and regulations which is essential. It must be done. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Without consideration whether it is convenient or inconvenient for you, which is, must be done, that is called <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapaḥ, divyam...</span> Just like Rsabhādeva orders that this human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Therefore in our Vedic civilization we find so many rules and regulations. This is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> From the very beginning of life, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> to go to the spiritual master's place and act like menial servant. <span class="Italic">Nicavat.</span> It is said. If the spiritual master says that "You go and pick up some wood from the forest," and one may be a king's son, but he cannot deny it, the spiritual master's order, "You must go." As Kṛṣṇa, He was ordered to go and pick up some dry wood from the forest. So He had to go. Although He was, His father was Nanda Mahārāja, a village <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> king, and Kṛṣṇa was Personality of Godhead, but He could not deny. He had to go. <span class="Italic">Nicavat.</span> Just like menial servant. That is called <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> This is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> So <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> is so essential that one has to do it. There is no question of alternative. Then <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> then.... If he marries, then <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> That is also <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> He cannot have sex life whenever he likes. No. The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "You must have sex life like this: once in a month and only for begetting children." So that is also <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> They do not follow, people do not follow any <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> at the present moment. But human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> regulative principles. Even in ordinary life.... Just like you are driving your car, you are going to some urgent business, and you saw the red light. You have to stop. You cannot say, "I have to leave by this time. I must go." No. You must. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> So <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> means to follow the regulative principles strictly by the higher order and that is human life. And animal life means you can do whatever you like. They keep to the right, keep to the left, it doesn't matter. But their offense is not taken because they are animals. But a human being, if he does not follow the regulative principles, it is sinful. He'll be punished. The same principle. Just like when there is red light, if you do not stop, you'll be punished. But a cat and dog, if he transgresses, "Never mind red light, I shall go," he's not punished. So <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> is meant for the human being. He must do it if he wants at all progress of life. That is essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In terms of diet, dietary regulations, eating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> That is also <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Just like we are prohibiting meat-eating. So in your country this is little troublesome. From the very beginning of his life he is, I mean to say, habituated to eat meat. The mother purchases powdered meat and mix with... I have seen it. And by force. So he has been trained up eating meat, and I say, "Don't eat meat." So therefore that is troublesome. And if he's serious, he must accept the order. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> means in diet, in practice, in behavior, in dealing, and so on, so on. Everything there is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> That is all described. Mental <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> bodily <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> and what is called? Word? Just like <span class="Italic">vāco-vegam,</span> this is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> You cannot talk nonsense. You want to talk something nonsense, but according to... So they don't talk nonsense. <span class="Italic">Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvar...</span> If you talk, you must talk about Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> "<span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> has ordered me not to talk loosely anything, only talk of Kṛṣṇa." So if he does that, that is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> in the matter of words. <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> in connection with body. <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> in connection with mind. <span class="Italic">Vāco-vegaṁ krodha-vegam.</span> One has become angry and he wants to express it by beating or something doing very..., but <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> will restrict him. "No, don't do it." "I want to kill you." <span class="Italic">Tapasya</span> will restrict. <span class="Italic">Vāco-vegaṁ krodha-vegaṁ manasa-vegam udara-vegam.</span> "I am sexually inclined, but I cannot do it. This is not the time." That is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> I am restricted. In this way, <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> in every way, bodily, mental, words, practice, dealing. So these have to be learned. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> And that is human life. <span class="Italic">Tapo divyam [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want to make progress in spiritual life and you are human life, human being, you must act according to the sastric injunctions. That is called <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Brahma, before creation he had to undergo <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Is it not stated? Yes. So <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> is essential. You cannot avoid. Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question number twelve. "What is the role of rituals in religion? Are they to be discouraged as it is being advocated by some reformists or are they to be encouraged? If so, in what form? What is the role of rituals in religion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ritual is a practice based on <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> Unless one undergoes the ritualistic ceremony, he remains unclean. But in this age, because it is practically impossible to induce people to take all these ritualistic processes, therefore it is recommended that "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span>" That is special advantage of this age, that by constant chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> he automatically becomes purified. That is recommendation given by Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> The beginning is cleansing the heart, because we are impure on account of dirty things within our heart accumulated life after life in the animalistic way of life. So everything, advancement of spiritual life, culture, <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> means cleansing the heart. So this process, chanting the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> the first installment of benefit is cleansing the heart. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam.</span> And when the heart is cleansed, then he becomes eligible for being free from the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> or the materialistic way of life. When he understands that he is not this body, he's spirit soul, his business is different, and he understands that "I am engaged only in these bodily comforts of life, it is not at all essential because it will change. Today I am in American body, I have got so many duties as American. Tomorrow I may be American dog body. So immediately my duty changes. So that is not my real business. My real business is how to elevate myself as spirit soul to the spiritual world, back to home, back to Godhead." Then he changes his... <span class="Italic">Ceto... Bhava...</span> Then this materialistic activity is stopped. He is no more interested, that "This is simply waste of time." That is knowledge, that "I am simply acting for the benefit and comfort of the body. This is simply waste of time. I must act spiritually." That is called <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12],</span> cleansing the heart. He is wrongly working on the basis of bodily concept of life. That illusion is over simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> This is the first installment, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,</span> and <span class="Italic">bhava-mahā-dāvāgni-nirvāpaṇam.</span> Then he is in the process to stop the blazing fire of material existence. Then <span class="Italic">vidyā-vadhū-jīvanam ānandāmbudhi-vardhanam.</span> Then the ocean of transcendental bliss increases. <span class="Italic">Ānandāmbudhi-vardanaṁ sarvātmānam snapanaṁ.</span> Wholesale blissful life. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ vijayate śrī-kṛṣṇa-saṅkīrtanam.</span> All glories to the chanting of Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana.</span> Then the other processes... That is described in the <span class="Italic">Śikṣāṣṭaka.</span> So this is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's gift, that <span class="Italic">kevalaya bhaktya.</span> All the practices of austerities, penances, and mystic yoga, and so on, so on. There are so many things. Everything will be totally achieved simply by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra. Bhakti.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">Just like when there is sunrise, immediately the all-pervading fog disappears. Now this Kali-yuga, by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> especially by chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> one can be fully reformed and come to spiritual platform, and that is success of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The next question kind of relates a little bit in the same direction. Question thirteen. "There are various <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> prescribed in the life of a Hindu right from his birth to death."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Many of these <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> are not being observed today. Should they be revived?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Saṁskāra...</span> The real aim is to bring the rascal to the platform of knowledge. That is called <span class="Italic">saṁskāra. Janmana jāyate śūdra.</span> By birth everyone is the same, <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> means without any knowledge. But the <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> means <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> rascal, without any knowledge of spiritual life, to gradually bring him to the spiritual platform. That is called <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> And <span class="Italic">saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.</span> That is essential. The human life is the opportunity for understanding what he is and what is the aim of his life. The aim of life is back to home, back to Godhead. We are part and parcel of God. Somehow or other we are in this material existence. So aim is again come to our spiritual life, spiritual existence, where there is no struggle for existence, blissful, happy life. Because actually we want happiness, blissful life. That is not possible in the material world. That is in the spiritual world. That is the aim. So every human being should be given chance. That is real education. That is called <span class="Italic">saṁskāra.</span> So these <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> there are <span class="Italic">dāsa-vidha-saṁskāraḥ...</span> So in this age it is very difficult, but if one chants Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> without any offense, being trained up by the spiritual master, all the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> automatically become done and he comes to his original spiritual position, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> "I am spirit soul. The Kṛṣṇa is Param Brahman, and I am Brahman." As Arjuna said, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is also Brahman, I am also Brahman. But He's Supreme Brahman, I am minute Brahman. So my business is to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is teachings of Lord Caitanya, <span class="Italic">jīvera 'svarūpa' haya</span> (sic:) <span class="Italic">nitya kṛṣṇa-dāsa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 20.108]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if he engages himself in his original spiritual business, to act as the servant of Kṛṣṇa, then all reformation is done. So that advantage is given in this age: <span class="Italic">kīrtanād eva kṛṣṇasya mukta-saṅgaḥ param... [SB </span>12.3.51]. Reformatory process is meant for purifying him so he becomes <span class="Italic">mukta-saṅgaḥ. Mukta-saṅgaḥ</span> means liberated from all this bad association of material existence. And he becomes eligible to go back to home, back to Godhead. So this is the special advantage. The question is "Whether they should be revived?" They should be revived to the lowest necessity, but all of them cannot be revived in this age. But people should be induced to take to chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">maha-mantra.</span> Then all reformation will automatically become manifest and he will come to spiritual platform, <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> the realization of Brahman. Then <span class="Italic">prasannātmā,</span> he'll be happy. There is no lamentation, there is no undesirable hankering. <span class="Italic">Na śocati na kāṅkṣati.</span> He sees everyone on the spiritual platform. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> In this way he comes to the platform of devotional service, and then his life becomes successful. Is that question answered or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Just one question I have. You said that the <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> should be revived to the lowest?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The minumum possible way. Just like to make him a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> these four things are essential: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, no gambling. This must be there. You cannot avoid wholesale.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Cannot avoid?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wholesale. You must avoid at least sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Verse">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>janānāṁ punya-karmaṇām<br class="calibre2"/>te dvandva-moha-nirmuktā<br class="calibre2"/>bhajante māṁ dṛdha-vratāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.28]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">You cannot become a devotee unless you are completely sinless. So to become completely sinless you have to begin with these four prohibitory injunctions, or avoid sinful activities like illicit sex, meat-eating, smoking, intoxication and gambling. Then you'll be gradually completely sinless. One side, to practice things, and another side, to engage yourself in devotional service. To engage oneself devotional service under the order of spiritual master and the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> means to remain on the transcendental platform. Transcendental platform means there is no sinful activity. It is above. Sinful.... Pious and sinful activities are there so long you are on the material platform. Good and bad. Piety and sinful. But when you are on the transcendental platform, then you are automatically without sin.</div>
<div class="Verse">māṁ ca yo 'vyabhicārena<br class="calibre2"/>bhakti-yogena yaḥ sevate<br class="calibre2"/>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br class="calibre2"/>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 14.26]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Sin, life of vice and life of piety, they are within this material world. But when one is spiritually engaged, he is above the spiritual plane. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇan samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate.</span> So one side, voluntarily accepting these prohibitory process.... You can keep it open. (the door)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Tell him to leave the door open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the whole thing is that if you chant hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> and give up these sinful activities, automatically you become reformed, come to the spiritual platform, and in this way your life will become successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can we go on to the next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question fourteen. "It is said that the <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> has almost gone out of use, except for a few rites which remain in vogue for marriage, <span class="Italic">śraddhās,</span> etc. Is it advisable to revive the <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> with its stress on the performance of various <span class="Italic">yajñas?"</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not possible in this... Taking consideration of the time, circumstances, it is not possible. There are different kinds of <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍīya-yajña.</span> It is expensive also and there is no expert <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> to guide how to perform this <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> So Kali-yuga, it is not possible to perform <span class="Italic">yajñas. Kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 12.3.52]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the Treta-yuga <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> were possible. <span class="Italic">Dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt,</span> that in this age of Kali-yuga the real <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi su-medhasaḥ</span> [SB 11.5.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore those who are intelligent, having good brain substance, they take to this <span class="Italic">yajña, saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span> And practically we are experiencing, simply by <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> even the lowest person in the sinful activities, he is becoming purified. So <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> is, to revive them in this age is not possible. Neither <span class="Italic">jñāna-kanda.</span> That is also not possible. People are so fool and rascal that it is impossible. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura said... He has condemned <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa.</span> Even it is properly done. <span class="Italic">Karma-kāṇḍa,</span> by performing ritualistic ceremonies of <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa,</span> you can go to the heavenly planet. But what is the benefit there? You can enjoy there materialistic way of life in higher standard. That's all. You can live for a very, very long duration of period. But that does not mean that you become immortal. The demigods, they are called <span class="Italic">amara. Amara</span> means they have got very long duration of life. Does not mean he is immortal. So by <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> you can elevate yourself to the higher planetary system. Even it is properly done... And now it is not possible to do it properly. And even it is properly done, that is condemned. It is not required. Similarly <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa.</span> Even it is properly done... You can merge yourself into the Brahman effulgence. But that is also not safe because in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> we see that <span class="Italic">arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adhaḥ [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Even one merges oneself into the impersonal Brahman, he again falls down. <span class="Italic">Patanty adhaḥ.</span> We have seen practical, in India many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they elevate themselves by <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa,</span> but because they cannot stay, they again come to the <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa,</span> philanthropy activities and hospitals and schools. That is their fall down. So either in <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> you cannot achieve the real purpose of life. Therefore Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura has said, <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa jñāna-kāṇḍa sakali visera bandha.</span> Either you accept <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna-kanda,</span> they're different pots of poison. <span class="Italic">Amṛta boliya jeba khai.</span> If by mistake you take poison, death is inevitable. Similarly, by <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa</span> nobody can derive any actual benefit. By <span class="Italic">upasana-kāṇḍa,</span> that is the... The <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> Vedic ritualistic ceremony means there are three <span class="Italic">kāṇḍas: karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa,</span> and <span class="Italic">upāsana-kāṇḍa.</span> So <span class="Italic">upāsana-kāṇḍa,</span> there are recommendation of many, worship of many demigods. But the best <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> is <span class="Italic">Viṣṇūpāsana. Viṣṇor arādhanaṁ sarveṣāṁ. Viṣṇor arādhanaṁ param. Oṁ tad viṣṇuṁ paramaṁ padam.</span> There are different types of <span class="Italic">upāsana</span> recommendation, but the <span class="Italic">viṣṇor arādhanam,</span> worshiping Lord Viṣṇu, that is the Supreme. That is Supreme. So gradually, there is elevation to <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa, jñāna-kāṇḍa, upāsana-kāṇḍa,</span> but in the Kali-yuga all these things are not possible to revive. Best directly give him the best <span class="Italic">upāsana-kāṇḍa, Viṣṇūpāsana, bhakti,</span> everything will be automatically achieved by <span class="Italic">bhakti-mārga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda, fifteen. "Hinduism has been defined as a way of life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Actually it is the way. That, I have already described it. It is not a sectarianism like Muslimism, Christianism or "Thisism..." Hinduism also now one of them. Actually, it is a way of life, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> how to become elevated to the spiritual platform. So that begins by the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> to select persons according to his capacity to different <span class="Italic">varṇas.</span> Some of them selected, trained as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Some of them trained as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> some of them as <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> some of them as, remain... Those who cannot take any training, they are <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So in the ways (indistinct) there must be social division not by birth, but by education. <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> That we have lost. The so-called Hinduism they have lost. And because they did not follow real <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> therefore India, so many renegades, Muslim became... Once they become Muslim, there was no reformation. But according to Vedic principle, even one is fallen, he can be raised to the highest standard. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> One may... <span class="Italic">Saṁskārād bhaved dvija.</span> And Sanātana Gosvāmī says that</div>
<div class="Verse">yathā kañcanataṁ yati<br class="calibre2"/>kaṁsyaṁ rasa-vidhānataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dīkṣā-vidhānena<br class="calibre2"/>dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇam</div>
<div class="Purp-para">As by chemical process the bell metal can be turned into gold by adding with the mercury.... This is a chemical process. If you can add in the bell metal proportionately mercury, then it will turn into gold. Here is the process given in the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> If you are able to do it, you can do it, turn gold some of these bell metals. So the example is given that as the bell metal, base metal, can be turned into gold by chemical process, similarly, by <span class="Italic">dīkṣā-vidhānena,</span> by proper initiation by the bona fide spiritual master, everyone can be turned into <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> twice-born. <span class="Italic">Dvijatvaṁ jāyate nṛṇam. Nṛṇam</span> means all men. It is not there is no discrimination, that only the Hindus, only the Indians, or only the so-called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> can be turned. Everyone can be turned. That is the injunction. So this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to do that, trying everyone to become a bona fide <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Without becoming a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> you cannot become Vaiṣṇava. So this reformatory process is recommended in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> What is the question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hinduism has been defined as a way of life. In...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the way of life, that by reformatory process recommended in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> one should be elevated to the position of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśyas,</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra. Śudra</span> means one who cannot take any reformation. But one who can take up the reformation, he can be situated as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> as a <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> This is not by birth, but by education, by training. That is recommended for the all human society. Not for the Hindus or... Otherwise, why Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni? Pāpa-yoni. Striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās.</span> They are also taken as <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> And what to speak of the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and <span class="Italic">caṇḍālas?</span> They must be <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni.</span> Only the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya,</span> they are taken as highly elevated. But nowadays, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> In this age you cannot distinguish who is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who is <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> who is a <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> who is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> It is accepted that everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> because there is no reformation. So according to <span class="Italic">Pāñcarātriki-vidhi</span> everyone should be given the chance of becoming a Vaiṣṇava, a <span class="Italic">dvija.</span> And that is recommendation in the <span class="Italic">Hari-bhakti-vilāsa,</span> that by the proper initiation process everyone can be brought into the platform of <span class="Italic">dvija,</span> twice-born, and then he becomes... After initiation, his second birth is there. <span class="Italic">Saṁskārād bhaved dvijaḥ.</span> Then he's allowed to read the scripture. <span class="Italic">Veda-pathād bhaved vipraḥ.</span> He becomes <span class="Italic">vipra.</span> Then when he really comes to the knowledge of Brahman, his relationship with Brahman, and acts accordingly, then he is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And when he is perfectly situated in the eternal relationship with God, Viṣṇu, then he becomes a Vaiṣṇava. That is perfection of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is this practical in the present context?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are doing it. See. If anyone has eyes to see they can see how we are accepting the <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni,</span> so-called <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni</span> to become the topmost Vaiṣṇava, that is possible. Unless it is possible how it is being done all over the world? There is no consideration. The process is so effective that it is being done. They are taking it as a proselytization. But it is not proselytizing. Proselytization is superflous. If one is Hindu you make him a Christian, and you change the name. But what is the use of changing the name if you do not reform him about his character? Simply changing the name from Hindu to Muslim or Muslim to Christian, that does not make him better...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This next question is rather interesting. Question sixteen. "Is it not possible for all sections of Hindus, be they <span class="Italic">Advaitans, Dvaitans,</span> or <span class="Italic">viṣiṣṭādvaitans,</span> to come together instead of remaining isolated as warring factions?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Dvaita</span> and <span class="Italic">advaita.</span> This is the process of Caitanya Mahāprabhu, to bring all the <span class="Italic">dvaitas</span> and <span class="Italic">advaitas</span> in one platform. To understand that he is essentially servant of God. The <span class="Italic">Advaitas,</span> they are wrongly thinking that he is God himself. That is wrong, or not the proper way of thinking. How you can become God? God is <span class="Italic">ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇam,</span> full with six opulences, all-powerful, all-strenght, all-beauty, all opulent. So this is artificial, to think to become God. And... This is <span class="Italic">Advaita.</span> And <span class="Italic">Dvaitas,</span> they think that one is different from God, God is separate from the living entity. But actually, from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> we understand that God is always the Supreme and the living entities, they are subordinate. And in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> also it is said, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānaṁ cetanaś cetanānām</span> (<span class="calibre3">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13)<span class="Italic">.</span> Both of them are living entities, but God is the chief. The difference between the two, that God maintains other living entities. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> That is a fact. We are maintained and God is the maintainer. We are predominated, we are not independent, and God is predominator. But because the predominated living entities, they are part and parcel of God, therefore in quality they are one. This is <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> one and different. The living entity is one in the sense because he is part and parcel of God. So if God is gold, the living entity is also gold. That is one in quality. But god is great and we are minute, small. In that way we are different. Now, Caitanya Mahāprabhu has enunciated <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> inconceivable, simultaneously one and different. That is real philosophy. So on this philosophy everyone can come if they are reasonable. If they remain unreasonably stuck up in their own concocted philosophy, then it is difficult. Otherwise this is the fact, that the living entity is eternally part and parcel of God. <span class="Italic">Sanātana.</span> What is that verse? Find out. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Fifteenth chapter.</div>

<div class="Purp-para">"The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if he's eternal fragmental parts, how he can become one with the whole? The part is never equal to the whole. That is axiomatic truth. This is wrong conception, to become like God. The Māyāvādīs, they are trying to become God. That is impossible. They... Let them remain godly. Godly means servant of God. That will make him perfection, his life perfect. Vaiṣṇava philosophy is to remain, to act as servant of God. That is perfect. And if the servant tries to become like the master, that is artificial. Although in the spiritual world there is no difference between the master and the servant... Just like the boys, Kṛṣṇa's cowherd boy friends, they do not know Kṛṣṇa is God. They are playing with Him on equal terms. When Kṛṣṇa is defeated in the play He has to take His friend on His shoulder and he rides on the shoulder. So there is no such distinction who is God and who is not God. So that is spiritual conception. But the difference is always there. God and the part and parcel. <span class="Italic">Kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> We can attain that position after many, many lives' pious activities. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">itthaṁ (satāṁ) brahma-sukhānubhūtyā<br class="calibre2"/>dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena<br class="calibre2"/>māyāśritānāṁ nara-dārakeṇa<br class="calibre2"/>sākaṁ vijahruḥ kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 10.12.11]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">These boys are playing with Kṛṣṇa. Who is Kṛṣṇa? He is the essence of <span class="Italic">Brahma-sukha,</span> Param Brahman. So these boys are playing with Param Brahman. <span class="Italic">Itthaṁ brahma-sukhānubhūtyā dāsyaṁ gatānāṁ para-daivatena.</span> And for the devotees He's the supreme master, and for the ordinary man He is ordinary child. But these other children who are playing, they have got this position <span class="Italic">kṛta-puṇya-puñjāḥ.</span> "After many, many births' pious activities, now I have got this position, playing with Kṛṣṇa on equal terms." So this is the conception of devotional service, that when you go to the Goloka Vṛndāvana you cannot distinguish.... But they have got unflinching love for Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana life. The cows, the calves, the trees, the flowers, the water, the elderly men, Nanda Mahārāja and Yaśodāmayī, everyone is attached, central point is Kṛṣṇa. Everyone is loving Kṛṣṇa. And there is no such knowledge that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality.... Sometimes they see Kṛṣṇa's wonderful activities and they talk on: "Kṛṣṇa may be some demigod. He has come here." But they could never recognize that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. When Kṛṣṇa passed some dangerous position, so many demons were coming, mother Yaṣodā was chanting some <span class="Italic">mantras</span> to protect Kṛṣṇa that "He may not be put into some calamity." They never understood that Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality. But their natural love for Kṛṣṇa so intense. Therefore Vṛndāvana life is so exalted. <span class="Italic">Arādha...</span> What is called? <span class="Italic">Arādhyo bhagavān vrajeṣa-tanāya tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam.</span> Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that first of all Kṛṣṇa, Vrajendra-nandana, the son of Nanada Mahārāja, He is <span class="Italic">arādhya. Tad-dhāma vṛndāvanam.</span> And His <span class="Italic">dhāma,</span> His abode, Vṛndāvana, is also worshipable. They are equal. Vṛndāvana-dhāma and Kṛṣṇa, they are equal. So these are higher standard of understanding. Unless one is devotee, purified, he cannot understand that to become one with God is not the sublime idea. In Vṛndāvana one who wants to become the father or mother of God, to control God, that these Māyāvādīs cannot understand, Advaitavādīs. This is to be understood by the pure devotion, devotees. What is the benefit to become equal with God? Just become.... equal.... Other Vaiṣṇava philosophies they could not explain our relationship with God. But Caitanya Mahāprabhu explained the higher relationship with God. That is called <span class="Italic">vatsalya-rasa</span> and <span class="Italic">madhurya-rasa.</span> Especially <span class="Italic">madhurya-rasa. Anarpita carīṁ cirāt karuṇayāvatirṇaḥ kalau samarpayitum unnatojvala-rasāṁ sva bhakti śriyam.</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu gave information of the <span class="Italic">madhurya-rasa,</span> that our relationship can be with Kṛṣṇa in conjugal love. So unless one comes to the platform of devotional service, one cannot understand. But for general understanding this philosophy of <span class="Italic">acintya-bhedābheda,</span> simultaneously one and different.... That is explained in this verse. <span class="Italic">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> The living entities are part and parcel of God. So if God is gold, then living entities are also gold. This is equality in quality. But God is great, and we are always subordinate. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> We are protected, we are maintained, we are predominated. That is our position. We cannot attain the position of predominator. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda, question 17. "What is the future of Hinduism?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no future. It is already gone. (laughter) The future is already there. And what do you want more future? A man was beaten with shoes, and again he said that "He has threatened me, to insult me." So if he is beaten with shoes, then what insult remains to be done again? So Hinduism now finished. Now take to the process of Kṛṣṇa's order, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Teach this teaching of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to the whole world. Not only Hinduism; Christianism, and Muslimism, everything's gone. And even it is not gone, Kṛṣṇa says, " Give up all this nonsense." <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Give up Hinduism, Muslimism, Christianism. Simply surrender unto Me." That is to be preached all over the world, and that is being effective. So if the Hindus are interested in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which was spoken in the Hindustan, in the land of Hindus, they must seriously take to this instruction of Kṛṣṇa and combine together and preach all over the world and make others benefited and themselves benefited. That is the only way. There is no other second way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next question. Question number 18. "As the world is coming to be divided into just two classes, atheist and theist, is it not advisable for all religions to come together, and what positive steps can be taken in this direction?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already taken, already explained. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. The atheist class and theist class, they will exist always. This is material world. Even at home the father is atheist, Hiraṇyakaśipu, and the son is theist. So even at home the father and the son different. So that atheist class and theist class men will always exist in family, in community, in nation, in the... as you go on. But the theist class should take to the proposition of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and take shelter at his lotus feet, giving up so-called religious principles. That is oneness. Religion without conception of God, conception of God is humbug, bogus. Religion means to accept the order of God. So if you have no conception of God, if you do not know who is God, so there is no question of accepting His order.

<div class="calibre8"><div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is Sixth Canto, Third Chapter, Text Nineteen. When challenged by the Viṣṇudūtas to describe the principles of religion, the Yamadūtas said, <span class="Italic">veda-praṇihito dharmaḥ:</span> the religious principles are the principles enacted in the Vedic literature. They did not know, however, that the Vedic literature contains ritualistic ceremonies that are not transcendental, but are meant to keep peace and order among materialistic persons in the material world. Real religious principles are <span class="Italic">nistraiguṇya,</span> above the three modes of material nature, or transcendental. The Yamadūtas did not know these transcendental religious principles, and therefore when prevented from arresting Ajāmila they were surprised. Materialistic persons who attach all their faith to the Vedic rituals are described in <span class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (2.42), wherein Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">veda-vāda-ratāḥ pārtha nānyad astīti vādinaḥ:</span> the supposed followers of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say that there is nothing beyond the Vedic ceremonies. Indeed, there is a group of men in India who are very fond of the Vedic rituals, not understanding the meaning of these rituals, which are intended to elevate one gradually to the transcendental platform of knowing Kṛṣṇa (<span class="Italic">vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ [Bg. </span>15.15]). Those who do not know this principle but who simply attach their faith to the Vedic rituals are called <span class="Italic">veda-vāda-ratāḥ.</span></div>
</div><div class="Normal-Level">Herein it is stated that the real religious principle is that which is given by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That principle is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] one should give up all other duties and surrender unto the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. That is the real religious principle everyone should follow. Even though one follows Vedic scriptures, one may not know this transcendental principle, for it is not known to everyone. To say nothing of human beings, even the demigods in the upper planetary systems are unaware of it. This transcendental religious principle must be understood from the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly or from His special representative, as stated in the next verses.</div>

And after hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> as Arjuna acted, as Arjuna understood Kṛṣṇa, you follow that. Then <span class="Italic">mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then you are following the <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> You are on the real path. Just like we are. Here it is said, <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> Svāyambhu. Svāyambhu means Brahmā, Lord Brahmā. So our, this <span class="Italic">sampradāya, Gauḍīya sampradāya,</span> is <span class="Italic">Brahma-sampradāya.</span> And Svāyambhu, Nārada. Nārada is also in the <span class="Italic">brahma-sampradāya.</span> And Śambhu, Lord Śiva, he is also <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> He has got his <span class="Italic">sampradāya, Rudra-sampradāya.</span> And similarly, <span class="Italic">Śrī-sampradāya.</span> So all these <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> we must follow. <span class="Italic">Sampradāya vihina ye mantras te niṣphala mataḥ.</span> If you do not belong to <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> <span class="Italic">mahājana,</span> then you are useless. You cannot concoct any religious system. So either you be Christian or Hindu it doesn't matter. You have to follow the <span class="Italic">mahājana.</span> If a Christian says, "I don't believe in St. Thomas," what kind of Christian he is? Similarly, it doesn't matter who is a <span class="Italic">mahā...</span> But real <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> is he who is strictly following the principle as enunciated by God. That is religious system. Otherwise there is no religion. There is no question of religion. It is simply concoction. <span class="Italic">Mano-dharmi,</span> mental speculator. Mental speculation is not religion. Religion is the order of Kṛṣṇa and one who follows that order, he is religious. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda, question nineteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Now this question is clear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. So far I can understand, you're saying that there's no need to label that there's one religion in the world. Rather, everyone can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One religion is there already, that how to love God. This is one religion. Will the Christian say, "No. We don't want to love God"? Will the Christians say? Will the Mohammedans say, "No, no. We don't want to love God"? So religion means how to love God, and any religion which teaches how to love God, that is perfect. It doesn't matter whether he's Christian or Muslim or Hindu. It doesn't matter. You have to be educated to take your degree. It doesn't matter from which college you take degree. Similarly, religion means you have to learn how to love God. If you have no love for God, it is all useless. That is not religion. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">. Sākṣād,</span> Bhagavān Kṛṣṇa says, "You surrender unto Me." You cannot surrender until you love. You are surrendered to me, I am also an Indian. Because you have love for me, therefore there is surrender. If I say that "You die," you'll die. Why? Because you love me. So when there will be surrender? Unless one loves God. Unless that platform is not there, that "I love you, I can sacrifice everything for you." That is on the the basic principle of love. Therefore that religion is perfect which teaches the followers how to love God. This is religious principle. So let everyone come to this platform, how to love God. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are teaching nothing, but training them how to love God, how they can sacrifice everything for God. So that is religion. Otherwise a bogus waste of time, simply following the ritualistic ceremonies. That is not religion. That is superfluous.</div>
<div class="Verse">dharmaḥ svanuṣṭhitaḥ puṁsāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>viṣvaksena-kathāsu yaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>notpādayed yadi ratiṁ<br class="calibre2"/>śrama eva hi kevalam<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 1.2.8]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">You are very good, you are following your religious principle very strictly, adherently. That's all right. But what about your love of God? "Oh, that I do not know." So <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">śrama eva hi...</span> It is simply waste of time, and simply laboring. That's all. If you have not learned to love God, then what is the meaning of your religion? Then, when you're actually on the platform of love of God, you understand your relationship with God, that "I am part and parcel of God. Not only I am part and parcel of God, this dog is also part and parcel of.... Every living entity." Then you'll extend love for animal also. If you actually love God, then your love for insect also is there because you understand that "This insect, it has got a different body only, but he is also part and parcel, or my brother." <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> Then you cannot maintain slaughterhouse. If you maintain slaughterhouse and disobey the order of Christ, thou shall not kill, and you proclaim yourself as Christian or Hindu or this.... That is not religion. Then <span class="Italic">śrama eva hi kevalam.</span> Your going to the temple and church and everything is simply waste of time. <span class="Italic">Śrama eva hi kevalam.</span> Because you do not understand God. You have no love for God. That is going on, all over the world. They're stamping under some sect, but there is no real religion. So in order to bring them all in one platform, they have to accept the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If you do not accept in the beginning Kṛṣṇa, that He is the supreme, then you try to understand that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. That is education. There is somebody supreme. So if I say, because I am Hindu, I am Indian, that "Kṛṣṇa is the supreme," you may say, "Then why Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is Indian." "No. He is God. Just like the sun rises first in India, then comes to Europe. But that does not mean the sun is different. Similarly, Kṛṣṇa, although appeared in India, now He has come to Western countries, Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. You try to understand whether Kṛṣṇa is not God or God. But He is God. There is no doubt about it. If you have got intelligence to understand what is God, then try to understand. But He is God undoubtedly. So take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness and abide by the order of Kṛṣṇa. Then everyone comes on the same platform, the religious platform, one religion, Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Question 19, this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, this is clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone? We are part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa, our business is to surrender to Him. And Kṛṣṇa personally advises that "You surrender unto Me. I shall give you all protection." This is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we meet people in our preaching activities. They may, of course, claim to be very devout Christian or Muslim, but at the same time they will blaspheme Kṛṣṇa. Is it possible that such persons can actually be associates of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is just like in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement there are so many Christians, so many Jews, so many Mohammedan, and Hindus. Everyone is there. It is a question of understanding. So in the beginning if... But if he's serious to understand what is God, then he will accept Kṛṣṇa the Supreme Lord. If he knows what is God, then he'll understand, "Here is God." If he remains in darkness, he does not know what is God, then how he'll understand Kṛṣṇa? He'll understand Kṛṣṇa as one of us. That's all. But if he knows what is God then he'll understand. Yes, here is God, Just like if a person knows what is gold, then anywhere gold, he'll understand, "Here is gold." It does not mean only gold, in certain shop only gold is available. But if he knows what is God, what is meaning of God, that he will find in Kṛṣṇa in fullness. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says how He is Bhagavān, what is Bhagavān. You should understand and see from the activities of Kṛṣṇa whether He is not Bhagavān. It requires brain to understand. I say, "Here is God." Now it is up to you. If you know what is God, then test it, and then you'll accept God. If you do not know how to test it, then you may refuse. That is another thing. You'll accept iron as gold. That is your ignorance. You do not know what is gold. But if you actually know what is gold, you will accept Kṛṣṇa as God, there is no doubt about it. So this is the only platform, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Everyone come and take to Kṛṣṇa and understand God and learn how to love Him and your life is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But if the Christians are saying that "This is the only platform, the <span class="Italic">Bible,</span>" and the Muslims are saying, "This is the only platform, <span class="Italic">Koran,</span>" and the community of followers of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we have to see by the result. The result is... Only platform, that only platform, that is decided... <span class="Italic">Sa vai puṁsāṁ paro dharmaḥ.</span> That is actually religion. How? <span class="Italic">Yato bhaktir adhokṣaje.</span> If one has learned how to love God. If there is no love of God, then what is the use of claiming that this is the only platform? Where is the sign of love of Godhead? That is to be seen. Simply if you say... Everyone will say, "This, my, this property is the best, or my understanding is..." But there must be practical proof. The practical proof-say how to love God, what is the process of loving God? If you do not know your relationship with God and other's relationship with God, then how you know God? That is lacking. Nobody can give clear conception of God. Can the Christians give? Then where is love of God? If you have no understanding of what is God, where is the question of love? Love is not fictitious. You cannot love air. You love a person, a beautiful person, a beautiful woman. If you say, "I love air. I love the sky..." Where there is question of love?There must be a person. So who is that person we want to love? But they have no personal conception of God, neither they can describe the personal beauty, capacity, strength, <span class="Italic">ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇaḥ.</span> There is no such description. So they have got the conception of God, but actually they do not know what is God. But religion means you must know God and love Him. That is religion. That is first class religion. Is that clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When there is question of love, then you must know what is God, then love. But if you do not know who is God, then how do you love Him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are these actually the tangible signs by which one can judge what is real religion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Real religion is how to love God. And love cannot be done without knowing the person whom you love. That is the criterion, test. So if you have no conception, God, His personality, then how you'll love? Where is the question of love? Love is something tangible. It is not fictitious. So we accept, Kṛṣṇa conscious people, Kṛṣṇa is God, and we are worshiping Kṛṣṇa. And we are making progress. Just see our behavior and other persons behavior and judge. Hm? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> We had one priest who came. He was discussing with Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja. He did not know what God looked like, he never gave anything, never talked about God, but he said he loved God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What kind of love it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Nor did he say his people ever came to church. He said, "At best they come once a week." He said that's all that is necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, love does not mean that you come once in a week at my house. Love means you come to my house, give me some presentation, and take something from me. <span class="Italic">Dadāti pratigṛhṇāti bhuṅkte bhojayate caiva ṣaḍ-vidhaṁ prīti-lakṣaṇam.</span> Love means if you love somebody, then you must give him something, you must accept something from him. <span class="Italic">Dadāti pratigṛhṇāti.</span> You must disclose your mind to him and he should disclose his mind to you. <span class="Italic">Dadāti pratigṛhṇāti guhyam ākhyāti pṛcchati,</span> and <span class="Italic">bhuṅkte bhojayate.</span> If you love somebody, you give him something eatable and whatever eatable he offers you accept. These six kinds of exchange makes love. But if you do not know the person, the boy or the girl, then where is the question of love? Love begins... If you love some girl, if you love some boy, then you give something, some presentation, and he gives you some presentation. That develops love. You give something to eat and whatever he gives you to eat, you eat. You disclose your mind, "My dear such and such, I love you. This is my ambition." He dis... These are the exchange of love. So if there is no persons to person meeting, where is the question of love? That is not love. If I love somebody and weekly I visit that house, "This is the house," that's all. Where is the exchange of love? Love means there is exchange. If you love somebody, if you have not given anything to that somebody, neither you have taken something from him, where is the love? Is that love? Means imperfect knowledge. You love... The conclusion is religion means to love God, and to love God means you must know who is God. There cannot be any other alternative. You must know the person who is God. Then you exchange. That we are teaching. We are asking our disciples to rise early in the morning, offer <span class="Italic">maṅgala ārati,</span> then <span class="Italic">bhoga ārati.</span> Are we so fools, rascals, that we are wasting time in worshiping a doll like that? Sometimes they think like that. But that is not the fact. You know definitely, "Here is Kṛṣṇa. He is God, and we must love Him like this." That is the superexcellence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We do everything definitely on positive platform. Is that clear? Huh? Or anyone, any question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Then... You said we must know God before we can love Him. So that means devotional service is preceded by knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Yes, that is the process in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> There are 18 chapters. The whole 18 chapters is the education how to know God. And when Arjuna completely in awareness he accepted, "Kṛṣṇa, You are <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma, paraṁ dhāma</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">,</span>" that is understanding. Then surrender, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless you know God, how you'll surrender? If some third class man comes, "You surrender unto me." Will you do that? Why shall I surrender to him? You must know, "Now, here is God. I must surrender." The 18th Chapter is described to know God, and then Kṛṣṇa proposes, "Surrender unto Me." Then Arjuna did it, "Yes." So without knowing, how you can surrender? Know God. Then you surrender. Otherwise how, blindly, you can surrender? That is not possible. So this is the science how to know God, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The preliminary. If you want to know more, then read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> And if you are in intense love with God, then next, <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> how the intensification can be more intensified. That is <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is the preliminary book to understand God and surrender. And from the surrendering point, further progress, that is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> And when the love is intense, to make it more intensified, that is <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu, mad after God. <span class="Italic">Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> "I find everything vacant without Kṛṣṇa." That is the supreme ecstasy. So these things cannot happen (chuckles) without love. If you love somebody, then if he's not there you find everything vacant. Otherwise why? There are so many things. "How," people will say, "you are seeing vacant? Everything is filled up." That is another stage, transcendental platform. Lover and beloved, they can understand. <span class="Italic">Śūnyāyitaṁ jagat sarvaṁ govinda-viraheṇa me.</span> That is the supreme stage of love. Is that clear or not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> There's just one more thing. What's the minimum knowledge one must have to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is great. That's all. God is great. Kṛṣṇa proved that He's great. Therefore He's God. Everyone says, "God is great." <span class="Italic">Allah akbar,</span> Muslims say. God is great. It is translated, "God is great." And Hindu says, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma.</span> So God is great. So Kṛṣṇa proved that He is all-great. Therefore He is God. Kṛṣṇa, when He was present, He proved it that He is the great. Therefore He's God. If you accept God is great, and if you find somebody, he is great in everything, then he's God. How can I deny it? At least, you can see Kṛṣṇa great by His <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is still going on. Five thousand years passed, still <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is accepted as the greatest book of knowledge all over the world. Even among the Christians, among the Muslims, those who are really learned, they take it, "Yes." That is greatness of Kṛṣṇa, the knowledge. Who can give such knowledge? That is the proof that He is God. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya samāgrasya viryasya yasasaḥ... Jñāna,</span> knowledge. Where is such knowledge throughout the whole world? Everything, every line is sublime knowledge. If one studies scrutinizingly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you find Kṛṣṇa is Supreme Lord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next question, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Question nineteen. "Do you envisage or envision a different role for Hinduism in the Western countries where the influence of other great religions has been felt for centuries?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is no different role. God is one. God cannot be duplicate. As it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> "There is no more superior authority than Me." That is God. Now people is to understand that Kṛṣṇa is God. There is no different role. The role is the same. Five thousand years Kṛṣṇa said that "I am the supreme authority. There is no more superior authority than Me." Still He is so. So we are simply attempting to introduce Kṛṣṇa. Nobody attempted. Although five thousand years past, nobody attempted to introduce the supreme authority Kṛṣṇa. We are just trying to introduce following the orders of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. He, five hundred years appeared. He is Kṛṣṇa. He wanted that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be spread all over the world.</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Kṛṣṇa is not for India. He is for everyone because He is God. He claims that "I am the seed-giving father for all living entities." Not only the human society, but also other living entities like the aquatics, the insects, the plants, and the animals, all living entities. He says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is there, but this cult of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, or <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, was not preached properly. Everyone interpreted <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in his own way to satisfy his own whims. We are just trying for the first time to present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and it is being effective. So it is not a different role. It is the actual role. Nobody tried for it. Therefore Kṛṣṇa was unknown, but we are trying for this for the few years. But because it is reality, it is being accepted. It is being accepted. No attempt was made that. So it is not a new role. The role is already there: to preach. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's vision. He says especially to Indian people,</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Indians are meant to do this business for <span class="Italic">para-upakāra</span> because all over the world they are unaware of Kṛṣṇa. So anyone who is actually Indian, he should attempt to broadcast the message of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and Kṛṣṇa. That is order of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata bhūmite manuṣya-janma haila yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is <span class="Italic">paropakāra.</span> They are suffering without any knowledge of Kṛṣṇa. Give them this knowledge. That is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra,</span> doing welfare activities to others. So that attempt is now being made, and people actually accepting. So it not a new role. The role is already there. Caitanya Mahāprabhu five hundred years told, years before He told it. But the so many swamis and yogis, they came here, they never introduced Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Now it is being done and people are accepting, naturally. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. So if everyone joins, either Indian, non-Indian, in this movement there will be one religion and there will be peace. Peace will prevail. This is the only way.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā mam śāntim ṛcchati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>5.29]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is the way of <span class="Italic">śānti,</span> understand Kṛṣṇa, that He is the supreme enjoyer, He is the supreme proprietor, and He is the supreme friend for everyone. Accept Kṛṣṇa as your friend, you'll be happy. This is the message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This next question is very closely related to the last question. Question twenty. "What is your view regarding proselytization or preaching? If you are..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not proselytization. Proselytization has no meaning. To bring one to the real understanding. Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> All living entities are His part and parcel. He claims, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> In all forms of life, as many living entities are there, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ,</span> I am the seed-giving father. So the natural position is that every living entity, not only human being, but also animals, plants, everyone... So why not Indian, American, or Czechoslavakian, everyone is part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa? So it not the process of proselytizing to convince the idea. It is actually bringing them to their real position, that they're all part and parcel of Kṛṣṇa. It is not artificial proselytization that "You are Christian, now you are Hindu." Or "You are Hindu, now you are Christian." "You are a sweeper, now you are <span class="Italic">harijana.</span>" It is not like that. It is actually bringing him to his own position, part and parcel of God. It is not... Proselytization will not stand. When one comes to the real understanding of his position, then that will continue. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that. Bringing one to the original position. He's in diseased condition, he's thinking otherwise than servant of Kṛṣṇa. Now this movement is trying to bring everyone to the position that he is eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa. It is not a rubberstamp proselytization that "You are Hindu, now you are Christian." Or "You are Christian, now are Hindu." So if he does not know what is his position by simply stamping that he is Hindu or Muslim or Christian, what benefit he will derive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you keep him in the ignorant platform, then what is the benefit of making a Hindu Muslim or Muslim Hindu? That was going on, "holy war," between Christians and the Muslims. Because both of them will die. (chuckles) And they are engaged in holy war. War, but "holy war." "Holy impiety." Artificial change of "ism" will not help. One must know the philosophy of life. One must know what is God. One must learn how to love God. That is real life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There is one more question, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Question 21. "Are changes visible in Hinduism in its doctrinal content, mode of individual and collective worship as a result of Hinduism's contact with the West?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are worshiping... This is... First of all, you must forget that this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is not Hinduism. It is Vaiṣṇavism. Vaiṣṇava means Viṣṇu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and one who loves Viṣṇu or loves God, he is Vaiṣṇava. So Hinduism is not like that. Present conception of Hinduism, they have got so many demigods. Demigods are there in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> but demigod worshipers, they are all materialistic persons. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that <span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ yajanti anya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who are worshiper of demigods, they are lusty. <span class="Italic">Kāmuka.</span> And the <span class="Italic">kāmuka</span> platform is material world, lusty. Everyone is trying to enjoy sense gratification. So demigod worship is for sense gratification. If you worship Durga, then you pray, "Mother Durga, give me name, fame, wealth, good wife, and so on, so on." <span class="Italic">Dhanaṁ dehi rūpaṁ dehi rūpavati-bhāryaṁ dehi.</span> Simply demanding for sense gratification. So that is not love of Godhead. That is to select one agent of God and exact from him as much as you can for your sense gratification. That is not recommended in the Vedic religion. Vedic religion, although there are demigods, but the ultimate is <span class="Italic">oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">sūraya,</span> actually advanced, they see to the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu paramaṁ padam. Viṣṇor aradhanaṁ param.</span> The worship of Viṣṇu is the supreme worship. So actually everyone should be worshiper of Viṣṇu. And that is Vaiṣṇavism. So Vaiṣṇavism means for everyone or <span class="Italic">sanātana dharma.</span> That I have already explained. The human.... The living entity is <span class="Italic">sanātana. Mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ jīva-loke sanātana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span> God is <span class="Italic">sanātana.</span> The exchange between God and the living entity is called <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma</span> or Vaiṣṇavism. So we are teaching that. We are not teaching Hinduism, Muslimism, Christianism. We are teaching how to love God. That's all. There is no question of proselytization. It is the natural. We are, by nature we are lover of God. Just like father and son. The love is already there. It cannot be extinguished. The father and son may be separated for many, many years, but when they come together the affection immediately revives. So we are teaching that, that we have got eternal relationship with God and revive it. We are embarassed by establishing artificial relationship with my family, country, and society, and so-called religions. These are all artificial. Real relationship, that "God is great and I am His servant," that is real religion. So we are teaching that thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the teaching is the same in India as it is in the Western countries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is being proved. Otherwise how they are worshiping Kṛṣṇa all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This question here is "In doctrinal content and mode of individual and collective worship..." Is that to say that in your preaching in the Western countries and your preaching in India, you haven't attempted... In the Western countries where there is so many <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> outcastes, so to speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is accepted by Kṛṣṇa. Even one is <span class="Italic">mleccha. Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there is no question. That is artificial. One is <span class="Italic">mleccha</span> or one is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but that is artificial. That is skin. But within the skin of the <span class="Italic">mleccha</span> or the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> the same spirit soul is there. Therefore those who are <span class="Italic">paṇḍita,</span> those who are learned,</div>
<div class="Verse">vidyā-vinaya-sampanne<br class="calibre2"/>brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br class="calibre2"/>śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br class="calibre2"/>paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 5.18]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">One who is actually learned, he sees the same spirit soul within the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> within the <span class="Italic">mleccha,</span> within the cat. (end)</div>
