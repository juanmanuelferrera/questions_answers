<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> Not the dress. Now what is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "The symptoms of a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> are that he is tolerant, merciful, and friendly to all living entities. He has no enemies, he is peaceful, he abides by the scriptures, and all his characteristics are sublime."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> The first qualification is <span class="Italic">titikṣava.</span> very tolerant. And Cāṇakya Paṇḍita has said <span class="Italic">kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinām.</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">tapasvīs,</span> their first duty is how much he is forgiving. How much he has learned to forgive. <span class="Italic">Kṣamā-rūpaṁ tapasvinām. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So what is the explanation?</div>
<div class="calibre8"><div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Purport? A <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> as described above, is a devotee of the Lord. His concern, therefore, is to enlighten people in devotional service to the Lord. That is his mercy. He knows that without devotional service to the Lord, human life is spoiled. A devotee travels all over the country, from door to door, preaching, "Be Kṛṣṇa conscious. Be a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Don't spoil your life in simply fulfilling your animal propensities. Human life is meant for self-realization, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness." These are the preachings of a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> He is not satisfied with his own liberation. He always thinks about others. He is the most compassionate personality towards all the fallen souls. One of his qualifications, therefore, is <span class="Italic">kāruṇika,</span> great mercy to the fallen souls. While engaged in preaching work, he has to meet with so many opposing elements, and therefore the <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> or devotee of the Lord, has to be very tolerant. Someone may ill-treat him because the conditioned souls are not prepared to receive the transcendental knowledge of devotional service. They do not like it; that is their disease. The <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> has the thankless task of impressing upon them the importance of devotional service. Sometimes devotees are personally attacked with violence. Lord Jesus Christ was crucified, Haridāsa Ṭhākura was caned in twenty-two marketplaces, and Lord Caitanya's principal assistant, Nityānanda, was violently attacked by Jagāi and Mādhāi. But still they were tolerant because their mission was to deliver the fallen souls. One of the qualifications of a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is that he is very tolerant and is merciful to all fallen souls. He is merciful because he is the well-wisher of all living entities. He is not only a well-wisher of human society, but a well-wisher of animal society as well. It is said here, <span class="Italic">sarva-dehinām,</span> which indicates all living entities who have accepted material bodies. Not only does the human being have a material body, but other living entities, such as cats and dogs, also have material bodies. The devotee of the Lord is merciful to everyone-the cats, dogs, trees, etc. He treats all living entities in such a way that they can ultimately get salvation from this material entanglement. Śivānanda Sena, one of the disciples of Lord Caitanya, gave liberation to a dog by treating the dog transcendentally. There are many instances where a dog got salvation by association with a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> because a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> engages in the highest philanthropic activities for the benediction of all living entities. Yet although a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is not inimical towards anyone, the world is so ungrateful that even a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> has many enemies.</div>
</div><div class="Normal-Level">What is the difference between an enemy and a friend? It is a difference in behavior. A <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> behaves with all conditioned souls for their ultimate relief from material entanglement. Therefore, no one can be more friendly than a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> in relieving a conditioned soul. A <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is calm, and he quietly and peacefully follows the principles of scripture. A <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> means one who follows the principles of scripture and at the same time is a devotee of the Lord. One who actually follows the principles of scripture must be a devotee of God because all the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> instruct us to obey the orders of the Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Sādhu,</span> therefore, means a follower of the scriptural injunctions and a devotee of the Lord. All these characteristics are prominent in a devotee. A devotee develops all the good qualities of the demigods, whereas a nondevotee, even though academically qualified, has no actual good qualifications or good characteristics according to the standard of transcendental realization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is this going on? (asking about banging sound)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's just the old reception room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They are making alterations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Alteration? What is that alteration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I don't know exactly what they're doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, what they're doing is that room, everybody goes there, the guests all go there. So in the past it's just been a big empty wasted room. So now what they're doing is making it a big preaching room with photos all around and book tables set up in such a way that someone can just walk in that room and there's a whole exhibit for him to see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has gotten this idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think Gopāla Kṛṣṇa. It's an exhibition room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they are breaking wall or what?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no, they're not breaking. They made a big door so that you can walk straight in from the outside. You saw that door yesterday. Now what they're doing is building shelves and bookcases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. That sound is disturbing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Would you like them to stop it until you left?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If stop then how their work will go on? They manufacture ideas and spend money. This is the difficulty. Everyone manufactures some idea. And break it, do it, dig it. Money is coming and they are spending it. They cannot adjust whatever is there. Big big ideas. Big big belly. And money we have to bring from America. "Give me one lakh, give me one lakh, 15,000. I make idea, you pay." So many rooms you can make showroom. Why breaking this door, breaking that door? Too many cooks spoils the broth. And repairing and, what is called, addition, alteration, will never stop. I do not know how to stop it. Now, the other, Yesterday that Viśvambhara said, you were here, no? Viśvambhara said, suggesting there should be raft (?) three feet high, seven feet high, this high... Everyone will suggest. And spend money. Any friend, you bring him, he'll suggest so that you may spend it. And wherefrom money will come? Oh, that is your look after. I am your friend, I am giving you good suggestion. Break it. Do it. I am your friend. You break your head. (laughs) There was a Mohammedan king, Raj Uddin or some... Nizamuddin. Nizamuddin there is a tomb in Delhi. He was poet. So if some friends come he would read some writing, and he will suggest, the friend will suggest, "Why don't you make like this." "Oh, it is good. All right." He'll do it. Whatever he says. And when he goes away, then again makes his own. So the secretary said, "Why you are changing?" "What can I do? Those... That is my friend. And that is nonsense; therefore I am again doing what I wrote." So we have to do that. As soon as you call anybody, he'll give you some suggestion. "Make this alteration, make this alteration." So description of the <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is there. It is very nice. Where they will find this description all over the world? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think there's only one person who's following that description.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I say about <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata's</span> description. How perfect it is in any subject matter. I have tried to explain what is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> expand it. That is not my explanation, that is Kṛṣṇa's explanation. I cannot explain now. That moment I could explain. That means Kṛṣṇa's... I can understand that. That the description is very nicely given. Although it is my writing, but I know it is not my writing. It is Kṛṣṇa's writing. So we should read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> always. <span class="Italic">Nityaṁ bhāgavata-sevayā [SB </span>1.2.18]<span class="Italic">.</span> We should not waste our time. So we have to check that closet. You can... [break] How they can say there is no God? Then you are only intelligent. All are fools. That means you are fool number one. If you think like that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, now you cannot say Indians. (laughs) Now we cannot say only Indians worship Kṛṣṇa. Whole world. That is God. They are not fools and rascals. They are educated, they are civilized. Why they accept Kṛṣṇa as God? Yesterday I was telling who? I think <span class="Italic">Caraṇam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Caraṇāravindam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Caraṇāravindam.</span> That the Englishmen were ruling over us. Now here is English boy, he's giving me massage and fanning me. What is the reason? Unless he feels something obligation, that "He has given us Kṛṣṇa," what business he has got? Not for him, for all of you, to give so valuable free service, unless there is this sense. What do you think? You have no obligation. You are European, American. I am Indian. It is through this via media Kṛṣṇa. This is practical. Therefore Kṛṣṇa is God. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> Because they have got sense that "We have got God," therefore they are feeling so much obliged. Kṛṣṇa is God, there is no doubt about it. It is not yet ready?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're making a plate now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Viśvambhara is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we shall follow strictly. Here is God. Take. Because if you are serious after God, here is God, take Kṛṣṇa. This is our philosophy. Hm? What is the answer? If he's serious about God. I think this paper wrote that, that Village? "We thought God is dead."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Greenwich Village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> East Village? That paper? Long ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Village Voice. The Village Voice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aha, yes. They told first, that "We thought God is dead." And actually they were dancing in the name of God. Acyutānanda and Brahmānanda. You have seen the picture showing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> In this French <span class="Italic">Back To Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, that's Acyutānanda too! Oh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They were the first candidates to dance with my <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I didn't know that was Acyutānanda. I recognize Hayagrīva but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's not Hayagrīva, it's Brahmānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's not Hayagrīva?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Hayagrīva...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's a picture of Brahmānanda and Acyutānanda dancing, and Prabhupāda's playing on tabla, and Kīrtanānanda sat down on the corner.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Boy, was he skinny in those days! This is Brahmānanda? And this is Kīrtanānanda Swami sitting down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just Brahmānanda, Kīrtanānanda standing together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Acyutānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Acyutānanda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Acyutānanda. And Kīrtanānanda's sitting down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kīrtanānanda's sitting there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. He sat next to you. He's shaved up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They're so skinny.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This was published in <span class="Italic">New York Times.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">New York Times?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> With picture. The other picture was published in <span class="Italic">Voice, Village Voice,</span> yes. Yes. Big picture. One page. They felt something; otherwise, why they should publish? Appealed to them, that here is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is really a historic picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Underneath a tree I was sitting and speaking. That's all. And when I would come back from the park to my apartment, at least two dozen people will come with me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like a Pied Piper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a story in the West about a man called the Pied Piper. He went to one place and played the flute and all the children followed him away from the village. You're like the Pied Piper who went to the West, took all the children.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you know French language you can read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He knows French.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, you know. What is written there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The article is by Hayagrīva, and the heading, it says, "Are you from India?" That was when he met you on the street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he first of all met me on the street and asked me this question. And I brought him, "Yes, I have taken one apartment here. You come here with me." Then I came back to show him the apartment. And from the next day they began to come, Kīrtanānanda and Hayagrīva.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Second Avenue apartment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And this Umāpati. Then Satsvarūpa. They began to come regularly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mukunda, you were already...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Mukunda was before that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> When was this, then, when Acyutānanda and Brahmānanda came. That was after...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This was in the park, Thompkins Square.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was after Hayagrīva and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, simultaneous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This was the fall of 1966. October maybe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was going in the park on Sunday and began from three. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, that <span class="Italic">dundubhi.</span> What is that, in the hand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A tom-tom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tom-tom. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> He's explaining why you came to America and that in three years you spread the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> all over the Western world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yogeśvara has many pictures of this. I saw all of them once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is good collector. [break] What is that reason? What is that reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> To perceive things and after that we can arrive at long-term solutions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, what is the problem and what is the solution? What is the problem that you require solution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Any problem which comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what is that? That I want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Problem is of being happy in the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are vague terms. You must distinctly say that this is happiness and this is problem. What is your, what is the idea of happiness and what is the problem? That I want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That I'm not very much clear at this stage of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Happiness, suppose if you can get a nice palatable dish for eating, you'll be happy. But the dog also, if he can get some good eating, he'll be happy. So where is the difference between dog's happiness and your happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Happiness should be combined with mental peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that mental peace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> To rest in yourself only. Don't run after worldly things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that is not possible for the animal. Therefore to remain happy within yourself, that is a prerogative of the human being. But we are not trying for that purpose. We are trying to be happy by eating, by sleeping, by sex or by defense. This is our platform of happiness. A dog cannot go to the restaurant, but a human being, if he goes to a restaurant and he can eat palatable dishes, he thinks he's happy. But what is that eating? In your standard you feel happiness, whereas on the street you'll find a pig, he's happy by eating stool. One man's food another man's poison. So eating happiness is there but the standard different. Therefore this eating is common affair, and happiness derived from eating is as good by the dog as by the pig and human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Your idea is clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we should know... Happiness is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: sukham ātyantikaṁ yat tad atīndriyaṁ grāhyam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is happiness, that is beyond the senses. The sense happiness is there by the pig and the man. But his standard of sense happiness is different from the man's. Standard may be different, but the happiness derived from the subject matter is the same. There is no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So happiness lies above the senses. Above our <span class="Italic">indriyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha. Happiness means spiritual happiness. That they do not know. Therefore I began my words that so long one is after material happiness he remains as an animal. Because the animal cannot derive spiritual happiness. They do not know. The man can know. Just like this boy, he's coming from very high family in America but he's now happy in this way, by taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> giving up everything, living very plain. He has got money he had got beautiful wife, he had got beautiful home, everything. But he has given up. Not his example. In our country there were many many big, big kings, <span class="Italic">rājarṣis.</span> Just like Bharata Mahārāja. He was emperor of the whole world. He gave up everything at the age of 24 years, young wife, young children. There are many examples. So actually, we have lost our Vedic culture, the objective, and therefore we are suffering. Simply by holding meetings and... Of course, these things will go on. Government has no other remedy by tax. Whether people are happy or they are happy, it doesn't matter. They have got the power, tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prasāda.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Your ideas are superb.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You remain in Mathurā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here is <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> Give. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
