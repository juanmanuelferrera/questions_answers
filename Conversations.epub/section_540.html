<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...nānyat. Na anyat.</span> So this is going on. And where is surrender? If you don't believe in Kṛṣṇa, don't surrender to Kṛṣṇa, then what is the meaning of this surrender? This is going on. Our, one swamiji, is there in Bombay, Cinmayananda. He is a big speaker in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and he has constructed temple-Śiva-liṅga, the genital of Lord Śiva. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He said he has translated... His interpretation of Kṛṣṇa is that this "Kṛṣṇa means black. Black is ignorance. So Kṛṣṇa is ignorance."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> I think one of the best persons in Madras who is translating the <span class="Italic">Prita-Gītā</span> (?), isn't it? Cinmayananda Swami.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Cinmayananda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes. I have heard it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Ramana Maharshi, (?) has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ramana Maharshi was a great man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> is a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ramana Maharshi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramana Maharshi? No, he did not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The Ramana Maharshi is actually a... Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He requested you, "You should always read it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Always read it," but he never preached about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he never preached about Kṛṣṇa. He may be always reading, but he did not know what is Kṛṣṇa. He never spoke that "Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Lord," never spoke. So what is the use of reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ramana Maharshi?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ramana Maharshi, yes, I am speaking of Ramana Maharshi. He never preached about Kṛṣṇa's superexcellent position, never preached. This is going on. Everyone is taking advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and he's preaching in his own way, foolish way. "Own way" means foolish way. This is going on. You cannot... Suppose you have got your philosophy, but you cannot take my book and preach your philosophy. If you have got philosophy, you write your philosophy. Why do you take advantage of my book and misinterpret? This is cheating. Because my book is very popular, you take advantage of my book and preach your own nonsense philosophy. This is going on. If you want to smoke <span class="Italic">ganja,</span> you smoke in your own hand. Why you capture my hand and smoke? What is this? So the <span class="Italic">ganja</span>-smelling will be in my hand, not in your hand. This is going on. Why do they take advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and preach their nonsense philosophy? That is our protest. You preach your nonsense philosophy. We have no objection. But don't touch <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> This is our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. What is the... Do you think it is honesty that you want to preach something of your own philosophy and you take advantage of my book and mislead others? Is that very good, honest business? This is going on. This is going on, very dangerous position. In our country, and what to speak of other countries, all these swamis, yogis, and politicians, and scholars, they are doing like this. Very dangerous position. Why should you touch <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> You speak, you preach, your own philosophy. There are so many philosophies. But our only objection is that "Why should you preach your nonsense philosophy through <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?"</span> Do you think it is right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's not right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> It's not right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you should understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> ...not believe Kṛṣṇa and preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> The thing is Ramana Maharshi did preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He had (inaudible) ...so he kept quiet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why should he kept quiet if he has read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> No. But, say, it's like this. Man who has understood philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> probably will not attach much importance whether it's Kṛṣṇa, Śiva or somebody else, once he has reached the supreme state.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if Kṛṣṇa... Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the supreme..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yes, He says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> then you must accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme. Otherwise, what is the use of...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> No, thing is... is that Kṛṣṇa is not supreme. Just because somebody doesn't pronounce the name of Kṛṣṇa, that doesn't mean that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he does not accept Kṛṣṇa as Supreme. Therefore he does not pronounce. That is the... If he understands that Kṛṣṇa is supreme, he should... Just like we have understood. We are chanting always, Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa... This is understanding, not, not... If you... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto mām: [Bg. </span>9.14] "Always chanting about Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Yeah, but, the thing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no "but." This is the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. You have to accept it. Otherwise, you don't read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> The question is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is, it... There is no question of "but." Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you do not do that, then what is the use of your reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityaja mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja, mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> If you do not follow these instructions of Kṛṣṇa, then where do you, why do you waste your time reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and mislead others? That is our protest. All these misleaders... Perhaps, throughout the whole world, it is the first time-we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. We are the only institution in the world that we are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā as it is,</span> and people are liking it. Before that, for the last two hundred years, so many swamis, yogis and..., they tried to preach Hindu philosophy, Vaiṣṇavism. Not a single person was a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, not a single person. Now you see so many young men. Why? Why this difference? Because we did not present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> adulterated. Presented as it is, that's all. What is the use of preaching adulterated things? Everyone wants... That appeals as it is. Therefore we present <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are preaching the same thing-"Always think of Kṛṣṇa. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You remember Kṛṣṇa always." This is the simplest process. You see all these young boys. They are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. And they are becoming purified from the mode of our life. And these swamis and yogis preached so many years, not a single person was purified. They were drinking; they were having sex. How they can be purified? And in India even, these things are going on, the land of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the land of Kṛṣṇa. If you want to read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> you take it. You follow it. Then everything will be done. <span class="Italic">Kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā śaśvac-chāntiṁ nigacchati. Api te su-durācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk.</span> These things are there. You may be fallen, downtrodden, but if you take to Kṛṣṇa's instructions, then <span class="Italic">kṣipraṁ bhavati dharmātmā.</span> Very soon you'll become... <span class="Italic">Kaunteya pratijānīhi na me bhaktaḥ praṇaśyati [Bg. </span>9.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> These things are there. And nobody is serious to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. They'll talk all nonsense, but he'll not take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is going on. So our task is very difficult, and especially all these prohibitive rules: no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no intoxication, even up to smoking or chewing <span class="Italic">pan.</span> So who will accept this philosophy? It is very difficult. Nobody can. Unless he is very serious about Kṛṣṇa, nobody will take. They have not taken. These principles are our Indian principles. <span class="Italic">Striyas-suna-pana dyutaḥ yatra pāpas catur vidhaḥ.</span> But who is taking this? Now they are becoming expert in intoxication, drinking wine. You see. This is India's position. In Europe, America, they do that because there was no such philosophy. But India... Here it is said, <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya karmaṇām</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> That, nobody's interested. Everyone is doing all sorts of sinful activities. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> He can understand Kṛṣṇa. But nobody is prepared to give up sinful activities. And how he'll understand Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is not very easy to be understood. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> One who is <span class="Italic">siddha,</span> perfect, <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānām... [Bg. 7.3].</span> Out of many millions of <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> one can understand Kṛṣṇa. This is... These things are explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> But nobody cares for that. He lives in his own way, and he has become a big authority. That's all. This rascaldom is going on. Only these few European and American boys, they have taken my words seriously. And therefore, with their help, Kṛṣṇa consciousness is moving. Otherwise, where is Indian? You are young men. If I say, "You come and join us," you won't do it. But they have done it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I have got lot of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everyone has got lot of responsibility. I know. But Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityaja mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> That is Kṛṣṇa's demand. Everyone has got a lot of responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I don't say responsibility.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> I say they have got a lot of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> towards Kṛṣṇa because in the house, all of us are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then preach Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. That is Kṛṣṇa's order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Daily we celebrate that <span class="Italic">Rādhā-kalyāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you play <span class="Italic">Rādhā-kalyāṇa?</span> Preach Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. Why do you go to Rādhā? First of all try to understand Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> has never said about Rādhā. That is very confidential. So why do you jump to Rādhā? Has Kṛṣṇa said anything about Rādhārāṇī in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Even in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> you don't see the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Rādhā... There, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> there is. That is foolish proposition, "In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> there is no Rādhārāṇī." There is. But at least in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa has never said about His <span class="Italic">Vṛndāvana-līlā.</span> No. That is very confidential. That is not for common man. The common man, first of all let him understand what is Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That they do not understand. Even big, big leaders, politicians, scholars, they do not understand. Because they do not take to Kṛṣṇa's instruction, therefore they fail to understand. And what they'll understand about Rādhārāṇī? You... If you are my confidential friend, then I can take to my family. And if you are outsider, why should you expect to come into my family life? This is common sense. You do not understand Kṛṣṇa, and you want to understand Kṛṣṇa's dealings with Rādhārāṇī. That is very confidential. <span class="Italic">Rādhā-kṛṣṇa-praṇaya-vikṛtir hlādinī-śaktir asmāt.</span> You have to understand Kṛṣṇa, then His pleasure potency, <span class="Italic">hlādinī-śakti.</span> The difficulty is that we do not want to become a regular student. Haphazardly, here and there, here and there, but I remain the same thing. It is a science. <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ me paramaṁ guhyaṁ yad vijñāna-samanvitam. Tad vijñāna samanvitam. Jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānaṁ pravakṣyāmi anasūyave, yaj jñātvā na anyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate...</span> [Bg. 7.2]. But the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> do not say like that. <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say, <span class="Italic">tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you are serious to learn about that, <span class="Italic">tad vijñāna. Tad vijñānaṁ, gurum evābhigacchet.</span> You must go to a bona fide guru who can teach you. Nobody is serious. That is the difficulty. Everyone is thinking, "I am free," although he is pulled by the ear by nature. <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> You have done like this, come on, here, sit down. This is going on, <span class="Italic">prakṛti. Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> The rascal, befooled by his false ego, he is thinking, "I am everything. I am independent." Those who are thinking like that, they have been described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, ahaṅkāra vimūḍhātmā.</span> The false ego is bewildered and thinking, "What I am thinking is all right." No, you cannot think in your own way. Must think as Kṛṣṇa says, then you are right. Otherwise, you are thinking under the spell of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that's all. <span class="Italic">Tribhir guṇamāyāir bhavair mohita, nā 'bhijānāti mām ebhyaḥ param avyayam. Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛti sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> These things are there. Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> thoroughly, follow the rules and regulations, then your life will be successful. And so long you have got, this is also right, that is also right, then you will not do the right. You will all be misled. That's all. That is not (indistinct). What Kṛṣṇa says, that is right. That should be the (indistinct). Otherwise you will be misled. So we are trying to preach this philosophy in that way. Maybe, very small number, but <span class="Italic">ekaś candras tamo hanti na cittara sahasra.</span> If there is one moon, that is sufficient. What is the use of millions of stars twinkling. So that is our propaganda. If one man can understand what is Kṛṣṇa philosophy, then my preaching is successful, that's all. We don't want many millions of stars with no light. What is the use of millions of stars with no light? That is Cāṇakya Paṇḍita's advice, <span class="Italic">varam eka putra na chavur kasatan api</span> (?). One son, if he is learned, that is sufficient. <span class="Italic">Na chavur kasatan api</span> (?). What is the use of hundreds of sons, all fools and rascals? <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti na cittara sahasras.</span> One moon is sufficient to illuminate. There is no need of millions of stars. Similarly, we are not after many millions of disciples. I want to see that one disciple has understood Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. That is success. That's all. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānāṁ [Bg. 7.3], kaścid vetti māṁ tattvataḥ.</span> So, first of all, to become <span class="Italic">siddha</span> is very difficult job. And then, <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> There is still difficult job. So, Kṛṣṇa philosophy is little difficult to understand. If they are understanding so easily, that is not understanding. It is easy, it is easy, if you accept Kṛṣṇa's words, it is very easy. That is the difficulty. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakta, mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru,</span> always think of Me. So where is the difficulty? You have seen Kṛṣṇa's picture, Kṛṣṇa's Deity, and if you think Kṛṣṇa, where is the difficulty? After all, we have to think something. So instead of something, why not think Kṛṣṇa? Where is the difficulty? But he does not take seriously. He has to think so many things, except Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakta.</span> There is no difficulty to take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Not at all. But people will not take it, that is the difficulty. They will argue simply. <span class="Italic">Kūṭaka.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakta,</span> where is the argument against it? You are saying that, they may not think of Kṛṣṇa, they may not say about Kṛṣṇa. And Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakta.</span> This is argument, this is not philosophy. Philosophy is there, direct, you should do like this, that's all. You do it and get the results. You go to purchase something, the price is fixed, you pay the price and take it. Where is argument? If you are, if you serious about that thing, you may pay price and take it away. That is the advice of Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti rasa-bhāvitā-mati kriyatāṁ yadi kuto 'pi labhyate.</span> If you can purchase somewhere the thinking of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakti rasa-bhāvitā mati.</span> That is, we have translated into "Kṛṣṇa Consciousness." If you can purchase this consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, somewhere, immediately purchase it. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-bhakti rasa-bhāvita-mati, kriyatām,</span> just purchase, <span class="Italic">yadi kuto 'pi labhyate,</span> if it is available somewhere. And if I have to purchase, then what price? <span class="Italic">Tatra laulyam ekaṁ mūlam. Na janma-koṭibhiḥ labhyate.</span> If you want what is the price, he says the price is your eagerness. And that eagerness to obtain it, takes many millions of births. Why you want Kṛṣṇa? Just like the other day I said that if one has seen Kṛṣṇa, he will become mad after Kṛṣṇa. That is the sign. These boys are certified in their own country by the Christian priests that "These boys are our boys, they will never come into church, they are never interested about God, and now they are mad after God. What is this?" Because that is the price only to purchase Kṛṣṇa. To mad after Him. Where is Kṛṣṇa? <span class="Italic">He rādhe vraja-devike ca lalite he nanda-sūno kutaḥ.</span> Where You are? Where You are? <span class="Italic">Śrī-govardhana pādapa-tale kālindī-vane kutaḥ.</span> Are You under the valley of Govardhana Hill or on the bank of the Yamunā? Where you are? <span class="Italic">Ghoṣantāv iti sarvato vraja-pure.</span> That was their Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simply wondering where is Kṛṣṇa, where is Kṛṣṇa, where is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Ghoṣantāv iti sarvato pure khedair mahā-vihvalau.</span> Madlike, <span class="Italic">vihvalau. Vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-go...</span> This is, this price one takes, then you can get Kṛṣṇa, you can understand Kṛṣṇa. It is not so cheap, that anyone can comment on Kṛṣṇa, whimsically, and he becomes a devotee. That is not possible. That is going on. I can interpret in my own way. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mām ekam.</span> (indistinct) Somebody is taking Kṛṣṇa is black, somebody is taking Kṛṣṇa as something else. Who says Kṛṣṇa is black? Who told me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Cinmayananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa means "black." <span class="Italic">Sapta nuraman pure sita kar baba.</span> (?) One has studied all the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> seven cantos, seven <span class="Italic">khandas,</span> and he is asking, "Whose father is Sītā?" Sītā is a feminine, and the <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> expert is asking, "Whose father is Sītā?" This is their education, they are becoming big lecturer on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> he has understood Kṛṣṇa means "black." And people are following him blindly. Big swamiji is speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Can we (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Kṛṣṇa means, actually in Sanskrit, one of the meanings of the word Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is all-attractive, that he will not explain. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span>, it is said, <span class="Italic">asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya-viśeṣa-śobhaṁ [Bs. </span>5.30]<span class="Italic">. Asitām, sundaram.</span> He is blackish, but He is so attractive, more attractive than many millions of Cupid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Why you should commit offense like that? It is a great offense to decry Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) ...describe Him as blackish or black.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why does he say Kṛṣṇa means black?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Kṛṣṇa means black, (Hindi) Somebody questioned me: "What is Kṛṣṇa means?" Then apart from this, Sanskrit reply he gave: "Kṛṣṇa means black also."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why did he not say Kṛṣṇa means all-attractive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> As far as Kṛṣṇa's features are concerned, we know it is (indistinct) black. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The last time we had come here, I had come to just see on the first day what he says. So on the first day he said that now we'll have a <span class="Italic">gītā-jñāna yajña,</span> and he said we will take the <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> which are suitable and which <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> are not suitable...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> ...we'll reject those <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not suitable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I heard that with my own ears. He said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. He said "We will take the <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> which are suitable and which are not suitable, we'll reject those <span class="Italic">ślokas."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. He is to judge which is suitable, which is not suitable. Just see, this philosophy. Cinmayananda or any ordinary person, he has to judge which <span class="Italic">śloka</span> is suitable, which is not suitable. That means he is more than Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa has spoken something unsuitable-which he can judge. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I believe that in another sense whatever is written, we should take the sweet from the (?)...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no sweets...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...and if there are some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Everything is sweet in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...the other part is there. (indistinct) ...that other part, that meaning be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Other part, there is no other part. There is only one part. Just like Kṛṣṇa says that</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuriṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So there is no other part. It is direct meaning. If anyone who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is either <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ, mūḍhāḥ, narādhamāḥ, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā, asuriṁ bhāvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) Don't attack the part of death. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He was going to (indistinct) <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span> He said he will not accept <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> which are, we can accept, those which we cannot accept we will...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Reject.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We will go for the next one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> That was the reference. He was saying, "Now from today onwards, I will start on this chapter and we will go on to these <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span>" He was referring to these <span class="Italic">ślokas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now Kṛṣṇa has written <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> not written, has spoken <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and He is speaking to me and I have to judge which is suitable? This is, is that my position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Perhaps what happens here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No perhaps. He says that "What is suitable, we accept. And not suitable reject." Now who will judge which is suitable and which is not suitable? That is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Here (indistinct) comes just for one day or ten days that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May no, what is your answer to this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is what I was answering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What he does, each day he takes one <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> and he just goes on giving discourse for an hour or what... (indistinct) ...he just has his discussion, "Now this <span class="Italic">śloka,</span> we will take and we will discuss."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have read some of his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...because his <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is there, all <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has said somewhere, I don't particularly know, "The Indian priests(?) think like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In his <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> in the verse that describes how to meditate on the formless, he states that although it says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that it is very difficult to understand the formless aspect, he says this was true five thousand years ago but now it is no longer true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have read in his <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Five thousand years ago it must have been true but now...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. There is the verse, <span class="Italic">kleśo 'dhikataras teṣām avyaktā-sakta-cetasām</span> [Bg. 12.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> So in explaining that <span class="Italic">śloka</span> he said, "It was painful five thousand years ago, but it is not now painful. It has become easy." That means the version of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> can be changed after five thousand years. Then what is the importance of speaking by Kṛṣṇa if it is changeable like material things? then what is the authority of Kṛṣṇa? Is it changeable?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is the interpretation of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Interpretation, first thing is that: why interpretation? If the meaning is straight, just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samavetā yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1].</span> And someone is interpreting <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre</span> means this body. Why this interpretation? Eh? The <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetra, kuru-kṣetra</span> is still existing, the station is there. People are going as <span class="Italic">dharmakṣetra. Kurukṣetra</span> (indistinct) <span class="Italic">ācāret...</span> This is the Vedic instruction that everyone should go to Kurukṣetra and perform ritualistic duties, that is being done and it is written <span class="Italic">dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre [Bg. 1.1],</span> why interpretation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You are more than Kṛṣṇa? You are so, you have got the audacity to speak more than Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Interpretation... (Hindi)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are discussing the same thing, we go or not go. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> People are waiting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) You are a young man therefore I am requesting you: don't be misled by these blind leaders. Take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, and you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The meaning is clear, very clear. There is no question of interpretation.</div>
