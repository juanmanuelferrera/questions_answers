<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind he's very nicely dressed. But because he is not surrendered soul to Kṛṣṇa, he is a miscreant. That's all Beware of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can anyone be said to be innocent in this world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are three classes: one devotee, one innocent, and one envious. So we have nothing to do with the envious. With devotee, we shall make friendship, and to the innocent, we shall preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the innocent souls, they're not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He'll surrender. You teach him. Because he's innocent, he does not know. But you preach, he will become. That is our duty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So persons who we preach to and give the message of Kṛṣṇa consciousness to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then let.... If anyone hears very attentively, that means he's innocent. He should be given attention. And one who says, "Why Kṛṣṇa Bhagavān? Ramakrishna Bhagavān." Oh, that's rascal, immediately. Take him, rascal. That's all. Finished. Created God. Huh? This Ramakrishna Mission has created God. God cannot be created. God is God. This is anthropomorphism. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Zoomorphism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> These people that say that they are God, they should be taken to court and thrown in jail for misrepresentation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is by.... There are some.... But first of all, if somebody creates God, then he should be challenged that "Where is your, what is your definition of God? If you were created God, corroborate with the definition. Then we accept." This is very logical. We can ask anybody, "What is your definition of God? What do you mean by God?" Then he has to explain. This is the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, once you told a man, "What is your definition of God?" And he could not answer. And you answered him that "God means the Supreme Being." And you said, "You are saying you are God, but you don't even know the definition of God. So how you are God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you do not know what is God, how can you say that "Here is God"? You cannot say. [break] One who is after God, he'll accept our philosophy. But the, those who are rogues, who want to banish God or kill God, they'll not accept. So we have to avoid such persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Persons who are too much sinful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...they can't give up their sinful activities even after hearing about Kṛṣṇa, are they in the envious class or the innocent class?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're envious. Sinful means that is the cause of their becoming envious. [break] ...law. Religion means the order of God. Simple definition. <span class="Italic">Dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam [SB </span>6.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Just like law, we keep to the right or left, order of the government. One who obeys this law, he's good citizen. One who disobeys, he's rascal. Similarly, <span class="Italic">dharma</span> means the order of God. So one who obeys the order of God, he is really religious. One who does not, he's rogue, <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> This is simple. [break].... Christian. Now, what is the order of God? The Ten Commandments. If one abides by the Ten Commandments, he's really Christian. Take Buddhism; if he abides by the order of Lord Buddha, then he's right. Take Muhammadans even. So it may be one is Muhammadan, one is Christian, or one is Buddhist, one is Hindu, but if he abides by the order of God, then he's religious. Otherwise bogus. We are concerned Vedic religion. Our conclusion is that to approach Lord Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Oṁ tad viṣṇoḥ paramaṁ padaṁ sadā paśyanti sūrayaḥ.</span> This is Vedic, <span class="Italic">Ṛg-mantra.</span> Or Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one abides by this, then he's religious, or really religious. If he does not obey, then where is the religion? There is no religion. The instruction is here. One has to understand the philosophy from <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> rightly and appreciate, himself, and preach. This is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we hear that, from different religions, one should have faith in God. One should have faith in God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless one has faith, how he'll surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we see that persons, they speak of having faith without actually following the instruction of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's rascal! What is the meaning of faith? If you don't surrender, where is the meaning of faith? He's a rascal. When the surrender comes? When I have got full faith-"Oh, Kṛṣṇa is God, He's saying surrender. All right, let me surrender"-that is faith. "Yes, I have faith, but I don't surrender." What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "But we have weaknesses. Temptation is very strong."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another. You strongly pray to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te.</span> Then it will be possible. And if you have got less faith, then it will..., you'll have to suffer. You'll have to suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> We sometimes see that those who have faith in their religious process, but because in their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is not faith, that is rascaldom. If you have faith, you must abide by the religious process. If you don't follow, that means you have no faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> But sometimes we meet a rare soul who does follow, but because there's no mention of Kṛṣṇa in his scripture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not the question of Kṛṣṇa religion.... If he believes in God and the God's word is religion, so he must follow the God's law. It doesn't matter. Kṛṣṇa is another name of God. But God is the same, one, either you call Kṛṣṇa, or Govinda, or this or that. <span class="Italic">Nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktiḥ.</span> First of all, one must be faithful to God. That you may call God or Allah, it doesn't matter. But you must know what is God and what is faith to God, what is definition of God, what do you mean by "understand God." These things are required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that must become the practice of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practice is no question. We have to talk with science. Practice, you have practiced something which is against religion. That should not be taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's become the fashion of world...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fashion? Your fashion, kick on the face! No fashion! (devotees laugh) It is a science. It is not the question of fashion, a false faith, belief. These are all rascals. Science is science. Two plus two equal to four. That's all. There is no question of "I have no faith in this. I say five!" That will not be accepted. Two plus two equal to four. It is neither five nor three. If that truth is there, then there is faith. "God is this, and sometimes God is this"-that is no understanding of God. You must have clear understanding of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is the quality of a person who is actually faithful?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's accepting eagerly <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> if he's really follower of God. Because there is nothing extraordinary in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is the words actually for God to speak. You may call Kṛṣṇa or otherwise, but.... Just like <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This can be said by God only. Otherwise who can say that "You give up everything; surrender unto Me"? It can be said by God only. Either you talk of Hindu or Muslim, but ask one that "If God says, 'You surrender unto...,' will you refuse?" Let him become Muslim or Christian. So nobody can refuse the order of God. That is faithfulness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, why are there so many pseudo religions then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no religion! This is the only religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then why do they mingle at all? Why do they even get involved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we say that one who has no faith in God, he's a rascal, miscreant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But they pretend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pretend? Kick them! Why you should accept pretension? Then you are a fool also. You say "pretend," and still, you have to talk about them. That means you are also faithless. Why should you talk about the pretension? Pretension is pretension. That is faithlessness. Sometimes they pretend honest, but he's a thief. What is this philosophy? Thief is thief. That's all. [break] ...thoroughly the science of God. That is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> The words which is spoken in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that can be spoken only by God. Nobody else can speak like that. Who can say? Who has the right to say that "You surrender unto Me"? Nobody has right. Only God can say. That is God. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Enviousness is caused by sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Enviousness is caused by sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> And in the Fifteenth Chapter of the Seventh Canto, in one verse you mention that enviousness can be given up if one gives up the tendency to sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we see sometimes that the Māyāvādīs, they have perhaps given up the affairs of this world, but still, they remain envious, inimical towards Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So, how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he has given up? (laughter) What he has given up? You say he has given up; what he has given up? "I have given up everything, but I remain proprietor." What is this, given up? There is not, no "given up." The contradiction's there. One who has given up, what he has given up? He has not given up his personality. Then what he has given up? In Bengali it says that <span class="Italic">rasamba sataya chaibe tyāga,(?)</span> (indistinct) that "In the room, whatever is there, it is yours. But I lock it, I keep the key." (laughter) (Bengali) "I have given up." What you have given up? You have kept the keys. So we have to accept that he's given up? This is another foolishness. [break] So the first question will be, "You rascal, what you have got in your possession that you are giving up? If you have something, then you can give up. What you have got, first of all tell me. You haven't got anything. Even this body is not yours. As soon as God will kick you, you have to go out. Then what is yours? You say 'I have given up.' What you can give up? Nothing is yours." That is rascaldom: "I have given up everything; I kept the key." From here, for a few days we are walking. And while going, if I say, "Now this land I give you," where your land? Where you possess this land? This is like that. What you can give up? What is yours? You have nothing. This is nonsense. "I have given up." First of all, prove what you have got. If you haven't got anything, then what is to give up? This is all nonsense. <span class="Italic">Īśāvāsyam idam sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Everything God's property. So there is no question of giving up. Because everything belongs.... I also belong to God. My body, my mind, everything is given by God. Where you get this mind? Where you get this body? It is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: bhūmir āpaḥ analaḥ vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva, prakṛtir me aṣṭadhā.</span> He claims, "It is My property. What you have got? And you are also My part and parcel. So why you are...?" This is all nonsense, that "I give up." What you can give up? You cannot give up, you cannot enjoy. That is your position. If you enjoy, you are a thief. And if you say, "I have given up," you are a false. Therefore <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Somebody is thinking "I am giving up, and now I've taken <span class="Italic">laṅgoṭā,</span> (?)(indistinct) I have become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" And whose <span class="Italic">laṅgoṭā</span> it is? You have got still the <span class="Italic">laṅgoṭā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The...? The...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Laṅgoṭā</span> means the loincloth. So what is it you have given up? And you cannot give up your body. This is made, this <span class="Italic">kṣitir ap-tejo-marud-vyoma,</span> (indistinct) these five elements, they're also Kṛṣṇa's. You have got mind. Oh, that belongs to Kṛṣṇa. What you have got that you'll give up? You have stolen everything. You don't accept the real proprietor, and you are thinking, "I am the proprietor." That is your fault. That is miscreant. <span class="Italic">Stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12].</span> It is said there. Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> carefully, that everyone is a thief. <span class="Italic">Stena eva sa ucyate.</span> All thiefs, rogues, rascals. That is the substance. If one does not accept God, the Supreme, and does not surrender, he is miscreant, <span class="Italic">mūḍha. Mūḍha.</span> He does not know what does he possess, and he's thinking, "I am giving up." What you are giving up? You do not possess anything. A <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> falsely thinking that "I am giving up." What you have got? Nobody can give up, nobody can enjoy. This is real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Jīvera 'svarūpa' haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa:</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109] "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa. Everything possessed by Kṛṣṇa. So I'll simply try to offer Kṛṣṇa whatever is there for His..." Just like <span class="Italic">nokara</span> (indistinct), servant, in a house, he's trying to satisfy the master. But the things does not belong to him. The things belongs to the master. But if he serves very nicely, master becomes pleased, "Oh, he is very faithful servant. Perfect." Faithful means he knows that "Everything belongs to master, and everything should be utilized for master's pleasure, not for my pleasure." Then he's a thief, he's a bad servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Prabhupāda, what about these people that perform so-called <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> but their aim is to merge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm? That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> That is not <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Who says that is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> I said "so-called" <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that is not.... Cheating! That is another cheating. (Hindi) There is the same example. "Now I am serving the master. Just as soon as the master will be somewhere, I'll take everything." That kind of servant. Servant serving the master, but the intention is that "As soon as master is away, I'll take everything." (laughter) "I'll become Nārāyaṇa. Let me serve now Nārāyaṇa, and as soon as there is the opportunity, I shall become Nārāyaṇa." They are thieves, rogues, these <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ narādhamāḥ.</span> Very faithful servant. He's planning how to usurp everything belonging to the master, and saying, "I am very faithful servant." Caitanya Mahāprabhu is teaching <span class="Italic">mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Life after life, let me serve You." That's all. Never willing to become master. That is Māyāvāda. [break] ...don't want even salvation. Therefore He says, <span class="Italic">janmani janmani,</span> "life after life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...go back to Godhead can be sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is also a contaminated desire. Otherwise why Caitanya will say <span class="Italic">mama janmani,</span> to go? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yad gatvā na nivartante tad dhāma paramam [Bg. 15.6].</span> If one goes to Vaikuṇṭha he does not come. But Caitanya also says He does not desire that. He is.... "Let me remain perpetually here, but be engaged in Your service." That is real, pure devotee. He doesn't want even promotion. That is also mentioned now: <span class="Italic">dīyamānaṁ na gṛhṇanti. Dīyamānam,</span> even Kṛṣṇa says, "Come immediately to Vaikuṇṭha," "Sir, that is for..." Just like Prahlāda Mahārāja. Prahlāda Mahārāja was offered, "Whatever you like, you take." "Sir, do not make me a <span class="Italic">bāniyā</span> (indistinct)." [break] But if anyone wants in exchange of service, then he's not a devotee, he's a <span class="Italic">bāniyā</span> (merchant).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Is that a merchant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Merchant, yes.</div>
<div class="Verse">na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kavitāṁ vā jagadīśa kāmaye<br class="calibre2"/>mama janmani janmanīśvare<br class="calibre2"/>bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">This is prayer. No exchange. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura: <span class="Italic">kīṭa-janma hau jathā tuwā dās.</span> "If You want that I shall continue, yes, that's all right." That is full surrender. And on condition, "Sir, You'll take me to Vaikuṇṭha; therefore I'm surrendered." That is conditioned, that is <span class="Italic">bāniyā</span> (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So actually back to home, back to Godhead, means just back to devotional service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because a devotee is always in Vaikuṇṭha. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> He is already in Vaikuṇṭha. Why he shall for that, Vaikuṇṭha?

<div class="Purp-para">Why should you desire anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then they say, "Why you desire to serve Kṛṣṇa?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? That is not desire. It is a natural. That is natural. Obedience to Kṛṣṇa, that is my natural business. Servant's business is always ready: "What can I do, sir?" This is not desire. This is natural position. He's not desiring anything. He's simply ready, "What can I do?" <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is, he's not desiring anything. Desire means when I want something for my satisfaction, that is desire. [break] <span class="Italic">...mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya.</span> He's simply expecting what spiritual master will order. <span class="Italic">Citta. Āra nā koriho...</span> He has no other desire. That is desirelessness. [break] Desireless means a wooden stone. It has no mind, how it can de.... But every living entity has got mind, so this is desirelessness, that "I'll wait for the order of my master and immediately execute." That is desirelessness. .... [break] stop functioning, then what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">guru-mukha-padma-vākya, cittete koriyā aikya</span> **? That means awaiting the order from the mouth of guru. <span class="Italic">Āra nā koriho mane.</span> He has no other desires. That is to be under.... [break] <span class="Italic">Nirvāṇa, nirvāṇa</span> means that you give up all material desires. Not that "But he did not say anything more than that." Because it was meant for the fourth-class men, so he did not say. He simply asked that you finish this material desire.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that not misleading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not misleading. It is truth, but the truth as much as you can understand. It is not misleading because Lord Buddha knew that "This rascal will not understand more than this." So he did not say further knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, so some of our men, when we sell our books, sometimes we have to say things in order to get them to take the book. So that's actually not misleading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, that is not misleading. Let him take, some way or other. [break] Why do you think was done by Lord Buddha? Because the atheist class, they did not believe in God: "There is no God." So Buddha said, "Yes, there is no God. You are right. But what I say, you accept." "Yes, sir." But he's God. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> We know that Lord Buddha is Kṛṣṇa. But he says, "No, no, there is.... No, there is no God. Yes, you are right.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Buddha's name is also considered <span class="Italic">hari-nāma</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Holy name? If one chants...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, yes. He is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what does the word <span class="Italic">"buddha"</span> mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Buddha</span> means "one who knows, in perfect awareness." That is <span class="Italic">buddha. Buddha.</span> In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> this word is there, <span class="Italic">buddha.</span> From <span class="Italic">buddha, budh-dhātu</span>. [break] ...see the Sanskrit word, <span class="Italic">bodhave. Budha-bhāva-samanvitāḥ</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you mentioned two different types of servitors. One is seeking to steal the property of the master as soon as the master is gone, and the other is sitting waiting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's thief; he's not servant. He's a thief. He has taken service as a matter of means that "If I remain as a servant, I'll get the opportunity of stealing." So he's not a servant, he's a thief. <span class="Italic">Stena eva sa ucyate [Bg. 3.12].</span> [break] ...becoming a thief, if you have got some desire, you ask, "Kṛṣṇa, I am very poor. Please give me some money." That you can do. That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Ārto jijñāsur arthārthī jñānī ca bharatarṣabha. Ārtaḥ,</span> one who is distressed, he's praying. That is beginning. But when he's advanced.... Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He'll say, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varam...,</span> "Now I'm satisfied. I don't want anything." That is perfect stage. But even one goes to God and prays for something, he's called pious. Because he has approached God. And because he has approached God and he's asking God, there is some transaction in this way, by association of God, he'll be purified. One day he will say, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yāce [Cc. Madhya 22.42],</span> "Now, I am fully satisfied. I don't want anything. I don't trouble You. Let me serve You." [break] Why the devotee will ask from God? Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">yoga-kṣemaṁ vahāmy aham, teṣāṁ nityābhiyuktānām [Bg. </span>9.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> He says the responsibility, "I shall supply everything, whatever you want." So why the devotee will ask? If the child knows, "My father is there, my mother is...," why he shall ask? The father will take care whatever he wants. It is unfaithful that "God cannot supply my necessities. I'll have to ask Him." He knows everything. Why shall I ask Him? That is pure knowledge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...circumstance there for someone who's endeavoring very hard for material necessities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Someone who is endeavoring very hard for material necessities, is his position the same-faithless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One who is going to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is working hard for material benefit. So why someone? Everyone. Who is not working for material necessities? <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca saman...</span> If the cats, dogs, human being, everybody is working very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Say, for example, one who is engaged simply in preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> One who is engaged simply in preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's serving Kṛṣṇa. He's not material necessities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is supplying all facility at least to maintain body and soul together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. I went to your country without any money. Now Kṛṣṇa has given. I went with forty rupees; now I have forty <span class="Italic">crores.</span> Who has done this business? So if you serve Kṛṣṇa, so Kṛṣṇa will supply everything, whatever you need, require. He doesn't require to ask for it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The question then is, is a devotee required to work very hard for material necessities?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He has to work sincerely to serve Kṛṣṇa. Then everything is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even he doesn't consider material necessity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is material necessity? Even for the cats and dogs, there is no material necessities. It is all supplied by Kṛṣṇa. It is simply <span class="Italic">māyā</span> that "I am in material necessities." There are eight million lower species of life. Who is doing business for his...? We, simply civilized men, we are doing this. Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is supplying everyone. <span class="Italic">Eko yo bahūnāṁ vidadhāti kāmān.</span> He supplies everything. Even the ant within the hole of your room, are you giving any food?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then how he's living? And the elephant in the forest of Africa. Who is going to give them food? How they're living? From the elephant to the ant, He's providing, and He cannot provide you. This is all mistaken idea. You haven't got to ask. Everything is there. Because in the.... [break] ...accustomed to sense gratification life after life, we are habituated to ask. That is a habit. "Habit is the second nature." Actually, we don't require. These dogs, they are not asking, going to the church for asking, "God, give us our daily bread." Where he is getting bread? [break] Dogs are enjoying, but they are not asking bread from God. And where they are getting? (bird chirping in background.) [break] ...how he's chirping so nicely. But he has no anxiety. He knows that "I'll get my food anywhere. That's all right." The bird has got the sense, confidence: "Yes, I'll get." And that's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They're living day to day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They are living day to day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact. God has given everyone; you'll get your food. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">tasyaiva hetoḥ prayateta kovido na labhyate yad bhramatām...</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<span class="calibre3">SB</span> 1.5.18]. "Don't try for anything else. Simply try how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious." That is your only business. Other things will come. If you're destined to get something, you'll get it. <span class="Italic">Tal labhyate duḥkhavad anyataḥ sukham.</span> Just like nobody asks for distress, how it comes? You are destined to get it. Similarly, whatever happiness you are destined to..., you'll get it. Why you are busy about distress and happiness? You simply try to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. (pause) Now? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can walk to the end. We got here at 6:15. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's giving to the human form of life, who can understand. So if we miss this opportunity, that is our misfortune. Last instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: sarva-guhyatamam, man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never says that "Try for economic development." (laughs) <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām...</span> It is the most confidential knowledge. [break] ...Purī was chanting in a solitary place, and Kṛṣṇa came to supply him milk. Why? His determination was that "If somebody gives me voluntarily, I shall eat. Otherwise, I am not going to ask anybody." But he is being supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Sanātana Gosvāmī also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But for a renounced order of life, the order is you must beg, <span class="Italic">bhikṣā.</span> Not much. If I can subsist by taking one <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi,</span> I'll simply ask for one <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi,</span> not for two <span class="Italic">cāpāṭis.</span> That is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> If you can without any <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi,</span> that is very good. But you can ask as much as you require. Not to eat sumptuously and sleep twenty-four hours, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And what about householders?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Householder can eat the whole world and sleep. (laughter) Because he is householder, he has got the concession. Everyone should do that. Householders are unable; that is their incapability. "Because I am householder, I have got the facility to have sex as many times and eat as much..." That is not householder. That is <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī.</span> There are two words: <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī</span> and <span class="Italic">gṛhastha. Gṛhastha</span> is different from <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī. Gṛhastha āśrama.</span> Although he's householder, it is <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> only for advancing in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> But <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī</span> cannot do that. [break] ...man has got the potency. Otherwise why they are offering...? Everyone has got the potency. We have to utilize it. Hare Kṛṣṇa. You understand English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (indistinct):</span> Yes, Guruji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, thank you very much. [break] ...<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Dharmāviruddho kāmo 'smi,</span> "Sex life which is not against religious principles, I am that." Not that sex life, as soon as you like, sex. That is not <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> That is <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī. Dharmāviruddha. Dharma-aviruddha</span> means simply for begetting nice child you can have..., not for enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Putrārthe kriyate bhāryā.</span> This is Vedic principle. <span class="Italic">Putraḥ-piṇḍa-prayojanam.</span> A <span class="Italic">bhāryā,</span> wife, is accepted only for having son. Not for any other purpose. <span class="Italic">Putraḥ-piṇḍa-prayojanam.</span> This is material side, but still, it is religious. First education is <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> how to train him to avoid sex life. And still if he's not able, then he is allowed to become a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> a little concession. Otherwise, the whole Vedic civilization is: how to avoid sex life. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī</span>-no sex life. <span class="Italic">Vānaprastha</span>-no sex life. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span>-no sex life. Only <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> under control. That is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha. Gṛhastha</span> does not mean one who is doing everything whimsically on account of getting this concession. He's not <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he's <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī. Apaśyatām ātma-tattvaṁ gṛheṣu gṛha-medhinām [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">. Śrotavyādīni rājendra nṛṇāṁ santi sahasraśaḥ, apaśyatām ātma-tattvam...</span> [SB 2.1.2]<span class="Italic">. Gṛhamedhī</span> means he does not know what is spiritual life. That is <span class="Italic">gṛhamedhī.</span> And <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> means he knows what is spiritual life, and he lives on that status. That is <span class="Italic">gṛhastha. Gṛhamedhī's</span> definition is.... Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam.</span> They do not know what is the aim of life. It is like something, something like cats and dogs. They do not know. <span class="Italic">Apaśyatām ātma-tattvam [SB </span>2.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] So he'll speak to you.
