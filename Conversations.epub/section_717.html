<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Well, he couldn't do that immediately because this one has been there for twenty-five years, but they will try to get rid of all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rather inconvenient to Mr. Matrey, because in front practically. We have got wall. He has no very much objection. And how will they allow? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Have a gate in the middle of the wall and so many people will be passing. It will be a big international center so it will look bad for India that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So stick to that point. That's nice. [break] ...may take advantage of offering obeisances consciously or unconsciously. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Dr. Patel:</span> My son and his wife came. Especially for them... They don't have other holidays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) [break] What is the use of the fighting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have heard that the man could have first landed on moon and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody landed. This is all bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, whatever he did... Let us... It is all bogus, but that man is divorced by his wife because he has lost his sex. Somebody told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many cases. This is the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Dampatye ratim eva hi:</span> "Marriage relationship will continue only on sex power, that's all." If one is weak in sex power, the marriage will be cancelled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You must tell any other good messages, how actually a marriage is, can be for production of good progeny...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Putrārthe kriyate bharyā putra-piṇḍa-prayojanam. </span>This, the first, <span class="Italic">piṇḍa-dāna</span> for maintaining family. But nowadays nobody wants offspring. They want to kill to avoid botheration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> First they prevent, and if by accident it happens, then they kill it. And the medical profession help them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Help them. Before my speaking you are saying. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I am against it, no doubt. Once upon a time I used to be the doctor of all these so-called cinema actors and actresses, and you know their profession. And they are always falling prey of these sort of things, and they would come to me for relief, and I would refuse. So today I have none of them as my patient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you cannot relieve them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, I have taken a vow not to do wrong things. That is why I am here in your company. Otherwise I would be somewhere in... That is very common in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only Bombay, all over the world. Now it is imported in India also, to get relief of pregnancy. This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> There is a big board in Andheri railway station. It says "For abortion and for family planning come here and get your (indistinct)." (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> The college boys are taking advantage of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Always you can get the beer, all beer, every place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Cold beer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, because I don't drink. I don't know. I have not taken tea even in England during my education because I am not to take tea. I am totally teetotaler of the right way. The society is right from the beginning body conscious, more or less, we. We are not taught even during our age of education that we are not this body and something else. This was being done in the ancient times, our forefathers. When the boys were going to the guru, they were first taught this, that "You are not this body; you are something else." And here you are taught you are body so you have to take exercise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the first education, first instruction in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā-dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā, tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Unless one understands that "There is change of body and I am spirit soul within this body," he remains a cat and dog, and that's all. <span class="Italic">Dehātmā-buddhiḥ. Yasyātmā-buddhiḥ kunape tri-dhātuke sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are keeping this civilization-animals. How there can be peace? You cannot make several dogs, bring them together as nation, and they will live peacefully. It is not possible that "You all dogs come here and feel nationally and be peaceful." Will the dogs will be able to do that? Because you are dog, it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (Hindi) They fight among themselves for nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they are keeping them cats and dogs by education, culture, and they want to be happy. How it is possible? First of all let them come to the standard of human being. Then there is question of peace and happiness. They are kept as cats and dogs, and how there can be peace? You cannot make any peace in the dog society. That is not possible. Hare Kṛṣṇa. So that consciousness can come only when one is spiritually educated. If he is simply engaged for satisfying the senses, material, then he remains a cat and dog. You cannot expect any peace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think the greatest damage done to this civilization of Aryans of India was by MacCauley, who introduced the British system of education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why you accepted that? (laughter) Why you accepted? Then why don't you accept? You should have refused.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Well, we were not there to refuse. We came afterwards. Our forefathers gave us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can... Just like they are reforming. Their forefathers were drunkards, woman-hunters, (laughter) and they are reformed, the great-grandchildren. And we old men, we cannot do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I talk of MacCauley...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> MacCauley may mislead you. Why you should believe?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He misled our forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why you should be misled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now we are going to lead them. Are you not leading them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Your forefathers might have been misled, but why you will commit the same mistake again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Now we have improved upon the mistake and we are leading them, and we will lead them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is not the fact. These boys, European, American boys, they were misled from the very beginning of their life, but how they are improving in spiritual consciousness? The thing is we are not prepared to take up our own culture. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right, sir. God must have some, something to fulfill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take for example our big leader, Mahātmā Gandhi. He was supposed to be very good scholar in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Did he ever preach that "You are not this body?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I come from the <span class="Italic">ashram.</span> Yes, he did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is the question of nationalism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He never says... When he went to England...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why he asked the Europeans to go out? "Quit India."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because they were exploiting poor people. There was a question of uniformity of people. There was no question of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there cannot be uniformity. On the bodily concept of life there cannot be any uniformity. That is a... When uniformity comes? <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> When? <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then uniformity. You have no knowledge of Brahman. You are living like cats and dogs. How there can be uniformity? That is not possible. [break] Practically you see uniformity. Somebody is coming from Europe; somebody, American; somebody, African; somebody, Canada; somebody, Hindu; somebody, Muslim; somebody, Christian. How they are becoming uniform? Because on the Brahman platform. And if you remain in this bodily concept of life, there is no question of uniformity. <span class="Italic">Para...</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">nirmatśarāṇāṁ.</span> This uniformity means "I am envious of you; you are envious of me." This is our position. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says that this... <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> culture is meant for <span class="Italic">paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So if you remain in the material platform, there is no question of <span class="Italic">nirmatsara. Para utkarṣa asahanam.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">matsaratā.</span> The whole basic principle... Unless you come to the spiritual platform, there is no question of uniformity, peace, prosperity, nothing. Therefore our movement is "Change consciousness. Come to the spiritual platform, Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then everything will be all right." Otherwise not possible. What is that, <span class="Italic">māṁ aprāpyaiva mūḍha janmani janmani</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Aprāpyaiva mām eva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One who is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, birth after birth he will be pushed into the atheist family, that's all. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha janmani janmani asureṣu</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mām aprāpya adhāmam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adhāmamaṁ gatim.</span> So their result is they'll go down and down. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then how he comes up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span><span class="Italic"> Tri-guṇasya.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para">If you engage him in devotional service, immediately he is transferred to the spiritual platform. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāmaḥ krodhas tadā lobhas tasmād evam... Tri-vidhaṁ narakasya-dvāram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! Yes. Yes. On the material platform, he... The human life is meant for spiritual culture. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> But they have rejected. They are simply busy.<span class="Italic"> Athāto deha-jijñāsā.</span> That's all.<span class="Italic"> Dehātmā-buddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have got little point on this, that after all, the spirituality within you, namely<span class="Italic"> ātmā,</span> cannot remain independently without this body, so you have got to look after the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is not the fact. If you are actually spiritually advanced, you don't care for it. <span class="Italic">Deha smṛti nāhi yār saṁsāra bandhana kāhān tānra.</span> It is just like Raghunātha dāsa Gosvāmī. He had no spiritual... er, material con... He was eating every alternate day a little quantity of butter. That's all. How he was living in Vṛndāvana? So when one is perfectly on the spiritual platform, there is no bodily necessities. That is the sign. Therefore our civilization is to decrease the bodily necessities, not to increase. Control. Control, from the brahmacārī, control, control, control. Ultimately completely control. That is perfectional stage. <span class="Italic">Tyāgena.</span> What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span><span class="Italic"> Iśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvaṁ yat kincid jagatyam... [Īśo mantra 1].</span></div>

Simply sit down and hear what Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That's all.
