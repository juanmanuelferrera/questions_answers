<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...all the potential audience, and I'm hoping we'll see the documentary. So it's just a couple of questions I'd like to ask you, if I may? And if I can record them, we can have them typed out. I hope my little tape recorder works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You sit down. Actually ours is not in search of truth, but we are presenting the truth as it is. We are not searching out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Right. Well, this is what I want to... I wanted to ask you... I'll put the questions in order. The questions in order is... The first one is, "Within Vedic culture, what is meant by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span>?" The second one... Shall we take it in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You just learn it first of all. Vedic culture is that we are living entities. Some way or other, we have fallen in this material world and encaged in this body or other body. So material world means the spirit soul is wandering throughout the universe under material conditions. And the Vedic knowledge is to get him out of this material condition and take him again to the spiritual world. This is Vedic knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And <span class="Italic">bhakti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> is the direct method. There are many methods recommended. <span class="Italic">Karma, jñāna, yoga,</span> and at last <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> They are different steps of the same staircase going upwards, and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the topmost level.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is a devotional surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Spiritual world means there the Supreme Lord is supreme, nobody else. And all others, they are engaged in His service. This is spiritual world. Here, in the material world, everyone is trying to be master. In the spiritual world there is no such attempt. They know the master is only God and all others, they are servants. That is the difference between material and spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I think that covers that. Second question. We were talking about that in this documentary, "In Search of Truth." Do you think there is any other way to actually realize God in truth and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God can be realized through <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> surrender. Otherwise even it is realized, it is partial, not complete.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, that answers that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span>... Just like I have got some official servant, and I have got very confidential servant. So to my confidential servant everything is disclosed. He knows everything. But official servant, he may not know everything. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the confidential part of understanding God. Otherwise they understand vaguely, impartially, not sufficiently. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is a verse, <span class="Italic">mayy āsakta-manā pārtha yoga yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ, samagram, asaṁśaya samagra mā yath jñās...</span> You can quote it. That is the first <span class="Italic">śloka</span> of the Seventh Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">sri bhagavān uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>mayy āsakta-manāḥ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>yogaṁ yuñjan mad-āśrayaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>asaṁśayaṁ samagraṁ māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yathā jñāsyasi tac chṛṇu<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.1]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"Now hear, O son of Prtha, Arjuna, how by practicing yoga in full consciousness of Me, with mind attached to Me, you can know Me in full, free from doubt."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That answers it. Can I have that... Chapter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pusta Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Seventh Chapter, first text. Seven, one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Prabhupāda, I believe that answers all the questions I went through before that. We'd just like to say it's been very nice to meet you. We're both, in our own way, trying to find truth ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Asaṁśa...</span> These two words are very important, <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaṁ,</span> "without any doubt." Everyone, every religion, they have no doubtless understanding of God. Everyone has some doubt. Neither complete. That is only in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We're just discovering veils of ignorance. We're trying to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any religious system, ask them, "What do you understand by God?" They will not be able to explain, because that is not complete, not doubtless. Therefore these two words have been used, <span class="Italic">asaṁśayaṁ samagram</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Our reading has only drawn forth a lot of conflicting answers so far. We've been reading into Hindu philosophies, and most of the answers conflict with each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which book you are reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, we've been just reading mainly biographies by swamis and yogis, Aurobindo and <span class="Italic">Resynthesis of...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no realization. They have simply jugglery of words. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's new for us, so I'm not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's very new for us. We've only been doing it for a few months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I've got it. I am reading it. Each time I read it, I find I read it a little better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Aurobindo has no clear knowledge. And which other swami you are reading?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We've read... Which one did you read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Maharishi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he has no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We've started practicing that Transcendental Meditation. We have found that by practicing the meditation we have had a change in consciousness. It has led us into further inquiry, so we've found that it has been valuable in a certain way, and that's the only actual practice. We have been reading things like Muktananda and <span class="Italic">kundalini-yoga</span> and that sort of stuff, the <span class="Italic">haṭha-yoga.</span> So it's just been an inquiry of our own which we've never done before. We've only been exposed to our own Christian scriptures. And we find in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> and Christianity a lot of similarities. They are the same, as far as we can see. It's difficult, though, to understand our scriptures in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> everything is clearly explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right. Our scriptures are interpreted, and we've been taught to interpret them in a certain way, and it hasn't been very clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What scripture you are... <span class="Italic">Bible?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> But we only know the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> as we've been told it, and it's been told to us by unrealized men, and we ended up being virtually atheistically inclined, until that led to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So in <span class="Italic">Bible</span> what is the conception of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's very unclear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I was speaking. In every religion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> To identify with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no clear conception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right. And I think this is the reason that leads you away. We've been led away from the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> because of that. There is nothing clear, and everybody who has read it to us has read it to us in a different way. But I would say that the finest book we have read is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> There's no question. (end)</div>
