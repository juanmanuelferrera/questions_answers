<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> (begins in car) ...the sun is the center, in that way above the sun. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...is not center. It is above the sun. It has his own orbit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brāhmaṇanada:</span> Oh. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is situated in the middle of the universe. [break] ...diameter of the universe is four billion or forty million? [break] Sun is situated 200 billion from the circumference of the universe. But the earth is between the sun and the circumference. Therefore it appears to be almost correct, 93 million. Apart from these differences, these people say there was no civilization before two thousand years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Three thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three thousand. [break] ...this knowledge is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> which was written in words five thousand years ago, but the knowledge was known millions and millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Some of the scholars say that because Lord Buddha is predicted in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> that it proves that the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> was written after Lord Buddha appeared.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Buddha said like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The scholars, they say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say it's not possible to predict a person's appearance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say because it's not possible by ordinary means to predict a person's birth, because Lord Buddha is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgava...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still there is a science, <span class="Italic">Bhṛgu-saṁhitā,</span> which will give you prediction of your next birth. Still there is science, <span class="Italic">Bhṛgu-saṁhitā.</span> He'll give you description of three lives: your past life, present life, and future life. <span class="Italic">Bhṛgu-saṁhitā.</span> [break] <span class="Italic">...Bhāgavata</span> it is said <span class="Italic">bhaviṣyati. Kikaṭeṣu bhaviṣyati. Bhaviṣyati</span> means "He will appear." Why it is not possible? You haven't got that knowledge, that is another thing. But it is possible. [break] ...one word: <span class="Italic">tri-kāla-jñā. Tri-kāla-jñā</span> means "one who knows past, present, and future." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">vedāhaṁ samatītāni</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> "I know everything past, present..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Equally, He says. <span class="Italic">Sama tītāni.</span> He knows the past, the present and the future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And He says in another place, "It is not that we were not existing in the past, and neither it is that we shall not exist in the future." So this is past, present, future. <span class="Italic">Tri-kāla-jñā.</span> So we are not going to the temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Italic"><b class="calibre4">Śrī Govinda</b></span><span class="Bold">:</span> Oh, yes. [break]</div>
