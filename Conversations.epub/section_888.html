<div class="Purp-para">(much static throughout)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can go there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want to go, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can go tomorrow. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We left in the morning. It looked like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was little earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. [break] About twelve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. And their main program is they go every day on the lawn at the university and they set up a <span class="Italic">pandal</span> tent and chant for about two hours. And they are building a truck for distributing <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> in the wintertime on campus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You make arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. Very nice clean house, but not much bigger than a house like that. But very nice and clean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forty-eight cents?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I don't know. Ambarīṣa? How much are cigarettes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> I think they're seventy-five cents. They are very highly taxed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who cares for it? (laughter) Wine is highly taxed in India. When I was manager in Dr. Bose's laboratory, he was manufacturing alcohol(?) for medicinal purposes. The cost was one rupee eight annas per gallon. The government was levying duty. For medicinal purpose, five rupees per gallon, whereas purchasing liquor, fifty-eight. The government would take profit out of it, fifty-eight rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> (indistinct) Fifth Canto (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today, there was description, there is description, the fight was so severe that the blood sprinkled up to the sun planet. So why not moon planet? Why they say sun planet? The sun is the nearest planet from the earth. So this calculation.... They say the sun planet is 93,000,000 miles away from earth? And if you add further 1,600,000 miles, it comes to about fifteen (50?) million miles. Fifteen (50?) million miles, they have calculated, go there by the sputnik at the rate of 13,000 miles per hour. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> They said they went fifteen million?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, according to our calculation.... We agree with the figure 93,000,000, as approximate to the sun, but then our figure is 1,600,000 beyond it to the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) Ambarīṣa does not agree. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> No, I agree. I wonder where they went? I think they went somewhere. Maybe not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Prabhupāda said in Los Angeles it's very easy to simulate these moon landing pictures in a movie so that they're.... Just like there are so many films now where they show this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> People in the classes, when the students say that that they do not see God, there is no proof for God, I give that argument you give. I say, "Well, I am a common layman, I have no proof that we've actually gone to the moon. At least I haven't gone to the moon. Show me right away that you can prove it me." They say, "Well, we have rocks, they brought back rocks." "I don't believe that they are from the moon." They are astonished that I..., we could actually doubt. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> There is another planet that is close to the earth that they could have gone to, isn't there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) some petrol station in the sky?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa and Satsvarūpa:</span> I never heard that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They've been planning all kinds of space laboratories and things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there was some plan that there would be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Another planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, intermediate station for supplying petrol.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> For airplanes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There was some suggestion. (Bengali) ...why Sunday first, and Monday second, all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Sun, moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] Sun planet, moon planet, Mars, Jupiter, like this, last, Saturn. So if this is systematic, then this calculation also means sun planet first. Why Sunday first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You've defeated everyone, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any one of these boys can answer? Why Sunday first? Ambarīṣa Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Why Sunday first? Because the sun is closer to the earth. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my version.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Yes, I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why do they say the moon planet first?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ambarīṣa:</span> Because their senses are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Svarūpa Dāmodara also, he also not replied satisfactorily. [break] ...do not count talking about sun, moon excursion. Why they are now stop, not talking anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> All they could get was some dust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already known. Further?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> They want to go to Mars and Saturn now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Moon finished? Simply by taking dust? And still the government is going to pay for Mars and Venus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They all do favors for each other. The government contracts big construction companies to build military bases for them. And then in turn they all have engagement, they all feed each other, like that. We met one boy in Houston, his grandfather was a disciple of Bhaktisiddhānta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Indian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. No, he is not Indian, he was German.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> German. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> His grandfather was German, he was raised in Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we had two German Godbrothers. One is that Sadānanda. Another was Bon something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He was initiated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...family they live in Houston, they're a big construction company, and they do all kinds of construction work for the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think his grandfather was also architect.... That gentleman was Jew.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I don't remember. I think he was. He used to work with George Harrison.... Harrison was their name. He was very rich. Their family does construction work for big government officials in Iran, and they are building one big naval base in Iran.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not to take our work in Māyāpura? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...letter, Śrīla Prabhupāda. He never returned it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...half of what he says isn't true. I would doubt that all these claims are even true. He says things and then they turn out not to be true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> He came on my bus for a week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> He's nice, but I don't think he has all that aristocratic background that he claims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span>...by the results. What a man can do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I was noticing as we walk that there are so many trash cans, but no one throws their trash in the can. There are so many trash cans, but none of the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are throwing their trash in the can. They just don't care. They throw it along the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda was pointing out that at seven o'clock in the morning you'll see everyone in the liquor stores, but they don't organize them to come and clean. You were mentioning that everyone is lining up to buy liquor in the morning with their money from the government. They don't work. But instead the government should have them working cleaning the parks, but they are not expert managers. [break] ...in the early hours the people are sweeping the streets, cleaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> People in America, they don't care, they don't care to even walk five steps to drop a paper in a can.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Makhanlāl:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Upadeśāmṛta,</span> in the eleventh verse, it says that if one takes his bath even once in the Rādhākuṇḍa he immediately awakens his love for Kṛṣṇa. I was wondering, some of those who have had the opportunity to take bath in Rādhākuṇḍa, it seems though it may take some time. I was wondering, is that because we don't see time in the proper perspective?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you go to Rādhākuṇḍa? Unless there is some awakening of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...he's a rich man's son, but he's walking without shoes just like a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...was the president of Ann Arbor temple. I told him what you were thinking. You think you really want to go to Ann Arbor?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessary. (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> ...God, Christ, they believe that Christ is God, some Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Many different understandings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Some say he's a perfect man. Some say a son of God or he's actually God. [break] ...a spirit within.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> ...Holy Ghost is like Brahman and Paramātmā. All-pervading God and God within the heart speaking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And Jesus Christ is the only son of the Lord, and he's the Lord also at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And they say he has a material body, and he is God incarnated into flesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We also say. <span class="Italic">Sākṣād-dharitvena samasta-śāstraiḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The guru is as good as God. And only by the guru...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he's servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes. And we also say only by the mercy of the guru. But they say only through Jesus. [break] ...so many similarities. Sometimes a Christian asks, "What is unique about your religion? Why should I...? It seems to be the same as what we have."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The unique thing is that we're actually able to follow teachings, whereas they are not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> I lived in one Christian monastery, Śrīla Prabhupāda, before, with monks. There is no bliss. They don't have <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
