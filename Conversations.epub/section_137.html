<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we take account of past, present, future of this creation. When I say, "Some years ago I was there," that means within this creation. It does not go some years in your past creation. Do you follow what I say? Are you following what I am saying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1) (woman):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are feeling all right? Satsvarūpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You did not go to the airport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> No. I gave the lecture that was cancelled at...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Lecture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You were supposed to give a lecture today, but because you gave a lecture last night in Buffalo, we cancelled it and I went instead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you lectured there? That's nice. Now you have to lecture. I will have to retire. (chuckles) I want that all my students now should be prepared. Puruṣottama, you sit down. You are standing. You come here. Sit down. When, at present, when we speak of past, present, future, we refer to this particular creation of my body. Is it not? Similarly, "never return back." "Never return back" means... What is your question? I... missing point. Whose question it...? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What is the question? That if we've never been with Kṛṣṇa, if we've never been in Kṛṣṇaloka, then how is it that we start remembering His pastimes and His form?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You remember Kṛṣṇa's pastimes by hearing <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> You can hear Kṛṣṇa's pastimes. That you can remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But how can we remember if we've never known them before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you can remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> If we haven't known it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can know it by hearing from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> Why we are citing so many scriptures, <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Bhagavad-gītā?</span> Just to remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Just to remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Something you forget, but I tell you repeatedly, you hear; you remember. Is it not? Here something you have forgotten completely, and I remind you constantly. Then don't you remember?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. But I don't understand how is it that we forgot it... How can we remember...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forgot, you forgot. That is your nature. You forget so many things. You cannot remember what you were doing exactly at this time yesterday. Can you remember immediately? Forgetfulness is our nature. We are very minute; therefore our..., we are subjected to the quality of forgetfulness. Just like Arjuna. Arjuna was asking Kṛṣṇa that "How I can believe that you told this philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> to Vivasvān?" He said that "In... I, first of all, I told to Vivasvān." So in reply to that question, Kṛṣṇa said that "Both you and I had many, many births before, but you have forgotten; I remember." That is the difference between the Supreme Lord and ourself. He does not forget. He remembers everything, past, present, future, all, but we forget. That is the difference between God and living entity. We are subjected to forgetfulness. So we forget; again, if it is reminded, we remind. That is our nature. So at the present moment we are forgetful of our eternal relationship with Kṛṣṇa. And then, by good association, by constant chanting, hearing, remembering, we again revoke our old consciousness. That is called Kṛṣṇa consciousness. So forgetfulness is not wonderful. It is natural. We forget. But if we keep constant touch, we may not forget. Therefore this association of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotees, and constant repetition of the chanting, scripture, that will keep us intact without forgetting. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kirtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have to continue this service constantly. Then we shall not forget. Forgetfulness is not wonderful. That is our nature. That is our nature. And that is the difference between ourself and God. God does not forget. We forget. We are claiming, some of us, foolishly claiming, that "I am God, but I forget." God does not forget. Therefore I am not God. Is that clear? That is the difference between living <span class="Italic">jīva</span> and Śiva, God. He does not forget. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> He says, <span class="Italic">vedāhaṁ samatītāni:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 7.26] "I know everything of this present, past, future, everything." But we do not know. We have forgotten. In our daily life, in our childhood, so many things we did. We don't remember. But our parents may remember that as a child, that we did this. So forgetfulness is our nature. But if we keep constant touch with Kṛṣṇa, then He will give us remembrance. So <span class="Italic">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says in the Fifteenth Chapter. Now you read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> very carefully. In our examination next January... Yes. From <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> for title of <span class="Italic">bhakti-śāstrī.</span> Now we have to make our organization regularly a spiritual institution so that we may be recognized, and our students may be freed from this draft board requisition. That I am... Next step is going on. [Break] <span class="Italic">Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.</span> Puruṣottama? Why don't you get that tape? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puruṣottama:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate na tasya samādhikaś ca dṛśyate.</span> This is from <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad. Parasya saktir vividhaiva sruyate svabhaviki-jnana-bala-kriya ca [Cc. Madhya 13.65, purport].</span> It is said that nobody is seeing... This is called research. You are accepting any nonsense as God, and they do not have any information from the..., that God means <span class="Italic">na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate na tasya samādhikaś ca dṛśyate:</span> "God has nothing to do, no responsibility. Nobody is found greater than Him." So if this Vedic injunction is followed, if somebody is claiming, "I am God," we have to see whether he has nothing to do and whether nobody is greater than him. And these two tests will make him false immediately. He has to prove that nobody is greater than... Even contemporary... Suppose I am claiming I am God. So I have to show that at the present moment, throughout the whole world, apart from universe, nobody is greater than me. Then I am... Will these pretenders be able to show that nobody is greater than him? This is a simple test. And <span class="Italic">na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate:</span> "And he has nothing to do." There are so many things to test who is God. <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍ-aiśvarya-pūrṇaḥ.</span> Nobody shall be richer than him; nobody shall be stronger than him; nobody shall be wiser than him; nobody shall be beautiful than him. So these things have to be tested, whether he is God. And simply if I claim, "Oh, I am God," there will... No testament? If I say, "I am President Nixon," will you accept it? If you don't accept it, even an ordinary President Nixon, without testing his credentials, how you will accept a false man as God without testing? You must know what is that test. Credential. He must present credential. Just like when some ambassador comes to a foreign country, there is a ceremony that that ambassador must be recognized by the governor or the governor-general in that state, and he has to place his credentials, similarly, anybody is claiming as God, he has to place his credentials. And what is that credential? The test is there in the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣad,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and so many, all literatures, <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, Vedānta-sūtra</span>, in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> In <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> first it is said, <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ, anvayād itarataś cārtheṣv abhijñaḥ svarāṭ [SB 1.1.1]. Svarāṭ, svarāṭ</span> means fully independent. <span class="Italic">Satyaṁ paraṁ dhīmahi.</span> The Supreme Truth, fully independent. We are not fully independent. And just now, if I feel a little toothache, I will have to go to a doctor. So how can I claim that I am God? God's first qualification is fully independent, <span class="Italic">svarāṭ. Abhijñaḥ. Abhijñaḥ</span> means fully cognizant of everything. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puruṣottama:</span> Lugdoos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. All right. Take. Distribute little. <span class="Italic">Na tasya kāryaṁ karaṇaṁ ca vidyate.</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa. He is the Lord, but He has nothing to do. He is simply enjoying with His friends, with Radharani, with cowherds boy, with <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span> That is greatness. He has nothing to think, "How to provide?" (chuckles) That is greatness. He is taking the cows as a sporting. You see? And when He was called for killing Kaṁsa, He left everything, renounced everything. <span class="Italic">Aiśvarya samagrasya yaśasaḥ...</span> Everything in full, so much love, so much everything, but at once, in a moment, He renounced everything, went to..., left Vṛndāvana, and all these devotees, they began to cry for Kṛṣṇa for the rest of life. And whenever Kṛṣṇa was reminded, oh, He will say, "I am very soon coming. Don't worry. I am very soon coming." (chuckles) You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girl:</span> Have took, Your Grace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have taken. You take. You know how to make lugdoo? Himavatī is good. (chuckles) She learned many things about... We have got another nice girl in Buffalo. I have given her name... What is? Sadā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Sadānandinī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A very nice girl. Yes. Always chanting and dancing and always jolly. (chuckling) Very nice girl. You know her? No. She has recently joined. She is good devotee, good worker, very nice. So Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice. Anyone who comes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately becomes beautiful in every respect. [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Puruṣottama.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How many rose trees Jayānanda has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puruṣottama:</span> 108.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 108. So at least 108 flowers we'll have daily. Yes. So it is very nice. Our Hawaii, tulasi grows very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Hawaii. They have a new place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the place where now Govinda dāsī is staying, a very nice place, just on the seaside. And the house is two stories, entire house among the fig trees. There is nice arrangement. So you have any correspondence with her?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jadurāṇī:</span> A little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what does she say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jadurāṇī:</span> She said the flowers weren't out yet, but that was months ago. We have some mail for you. One letter is from her with up-to-date news.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Some devotees are coming. And in Honolulu, two boys, they are also doing. In Hawaii there are two branches now. Yes. One at Honolulu, one at Kauai. Kauai. That island's name is Oahu. Hawaii has five islands' stretch, and this is called Oahu. Oahu island, one side, Honolulu, and one side... This island means hill. And the valley of the hills are utilized for residential purposes. So all sides, Pacific Ocean. And there is ample production of sugar cane and pineapple. I was chewing sugar cane as it is. Yes. And there is so many coconut trees, palm trees, and mango. In mango season they throw away mangos. So I have asked Govinda dāsī that "You make mango pulp and dry it and send it." So they are doing nice, husband and wife, Gaurasundara, yes, trying their best. I do not know whether they are working now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Govinda dāsī is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Working. She can work. She can earn $400 at least.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Typing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. She is good typist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> We have one boy in Montreal. He says that he wants to go to Florida the first of May. His father is a real estate man. So he wants to get a job and then get a temple, and he wants someone to come there. He said me preferably.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. This South, North Carolina, they are also doing... (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He wants to go to Palm Beach. Palm Beach is the richest place in the country.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That's all right. So chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and everything will be all right. And Buffalo is also doing nice. Oh, yes. The students are educated circle. They are taking interest, both the boys and girls. And three meetings I attended. Every meeting was full, two hundred boys and girls. They were dancing, chanting, asking very intelligent questions. And Rūpānuga is holding class. There will be some examination of the students. They accept papers. Yes. Some Indians are coming from long distance. One Indian gentleman, he came to see me from, what is that place? Ninety-two miles away from Buffalo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himāvatī:</span> Did you see Nauvanī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nauvanī is there. Yes. He is there still. He is also very good. He works very nice in the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Every day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's a very good man. Everyone who will come to this Kṛṣṇa consciousness will become good man, even he's a bad man. That is the influence of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Sarvair gunaiḥ tatra samāsate suraḥ.</span> All godly qualities will develop in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is the test. Now, our students, nobody can compare with their behavior, with their character, with their innocence. Everything nicer. So don't worry. Simply go on chanting. Everything will be all right. Don't worry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jadurāṇī:</span> Doesn't sound like you're concerned about temple affairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. It... That's all right. For the time being you don't touch. You chant and everything will be... Soon you will be in good health. Then you will again work. Yes. Śāradīyā, you are painting? No. All right, you finish your school. You are going to school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śāradīyā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. You are painting? That's nice. You? That's nice. Practice painting nicely. We'll require so many pictures. We shall publish so many pictures, book. You are not painting. You have no time to paint. You have got enough engagement. So you can... So long you are here, you just show how to Deity worship, how you are doing that, and they will learn. Yes. She is doing that very nice. So you can, all of you, all girls, you take, her. See doing, how she is doing. Who is doing your temple worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Are you going to give some more instruction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. This is... In this age temple worship is not recommended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's not recommended. But Deity worship is temple worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is Deity worship. Because nobody can actually, very nicely perform, this age is not suitable. You see? Temple worship, the regulation, the engagement-at least four, five men must always be engaged, always, twenty-four hours.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In the temple worship. In the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We haven't got sufficient men, neither we can arrange such a way. Besides that, your previous culture, everything is completely different. So in this age Caitanya Mahāprabhu has..., this <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is all round. But at the same time, if you can perform as far as possible, that's nice, Deity worship. In this age Deity worship is secondary. <span class="Italic">Saṅkīrtana</span> is primary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Does it matter who performs the Deity worship? Does it matter? I mean is it some particular person?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is called <span class="Italic">arcana-siddhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Who should do it? I mean, in the temple who should do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone should do it. Yes, everyone should learn. Everyone should learn. Sometimes somebody is doing something, somebody is doing something. Yes, like that. Everyone should be expert in every respect, twenty-six qualifications. (car noise outside) You have got car here? No. Nobody has got car amongst our disciples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jadurāṇī:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himavatī:</span> Do you need a car, Swamiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because the temple is here, just in front. So what is the use of car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Prabhupāda, I found a place very likely for a new temple. And I've gone so far as... The lawyer even drew up a lease. So maybe tomorrow you could look at it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. What is the description?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Very excellent location, right downtown. The things wrong with it is that the temple area is no bigger than the temple area we have now, but the location is just the greatest. Second floor. Still, right downtown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Second floor. So what is the rent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Three hundred a month. But we can do it as long as... Presently, Patita-pāvana is working and so am I, and sometimes the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> get some money. So we wouldn't have any problem as long as Patita-pāvana would continue to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right, Kṛṣṇa will solve the problems. But the space is not lesser than this temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, the temple room is maybe even smaller than the present temple room, but then there's another large, very large room for a kitchen and then another space where bunks could be for sleeping. So there's actually three different spaces. The thing is that the main temple hall is not too large.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. That doesn't matter. You have to take <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. That should be the main business. And the..., at least sixteen men, four <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅgas.</span> Practice <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga</span> like that. And twelve cymbals, and one chanting and all others responding. Oh, it will be tremendous. Take some flags, "ISKCON, Hare Kṛṣṇa" flag, red flag. You see? And conchshell, <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> In New York they are doing now, and they also one day collected 240 dollars or something like that. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puruṣottama:</span> 247.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 247. You see? (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I'll try in Montreal. We have new devotees now, lot of new boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, you will get devotees. You just begin <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> party. You will get many devotees. You see? In Los Angeles, daily the devotees, new devotees, are coming, and very nice boys. We are now searching after a bigger place. Yes. That temple is not sufficient, although that is the biggest center of all our centers. It has got compound. It has got parking place. It has got two big halls, one big room, one big kitchen, and three, four, five small rooms. It is a nice situation, you see, just suitable for our purpose. And they decorate Jagannātha very nicely. Yes. So increase centers. And what is the name of the boy who went to... Nanda-rūpa(?). He wants to open Toronto?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> In Toronto. Toronto is a very good place to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So let him open.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Let him go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Okay. But not alone. He needs someone else, I think. He needs one more boy. I don't think by himself he can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we shall arrange, somebody to go. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Maybe you remember Mr. Sini(?) in Montreal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, he approached me just recently. He wants to open a store, Indian store and goods, and he wants the boys in the temple to work there. He wants to make some arrangement so the temple will get some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very cunning man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, I know. I don't trust him at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants to utilize our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes. Don't deal with him, right? That's what I thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He wants a cheap, cheap price. [Break] I don't believe all these things they have... They have come here to beg, to make money. You see? Their mentality cannot be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> I have a letter for you from Gopāla Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Gopāla Kṛṣṇa is a good boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Oh, he's very nice. Oh, he's getting so nice. He wants to come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. Because he is serving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Himavatī:</span> He lives in our house now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> He lives with us now. You know we have another house, the whole house, and almost everyone now is a devotee there. And they're eating <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
