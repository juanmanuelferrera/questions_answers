<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> In the beginning you just asked everyone to chant, and naturally they wanted to do more after.</div>

(chants <span class="Italic">japa</span>) [break] ...you take another body, you will greet.... This philosophy does not appeal to the Westerners. Eh? I think so.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes, they do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is the actual fact.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So.... So they are not afraid of going to hell? There are two alternatives, either heaven or hell. But if he's going to hell?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That's why they have confession.</div>

You know that? It becomes a terrible fright for them. Therefore war was not declared. They are very much frightened. They have suffered two big world wars. So why the God did not protect them?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They want to think they're the body. They don't want to hear that "I'm not the body," because if they're not in illusion, they can't try and enjoy so much the things of the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means foolish, less intelligent.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You know, and they never saw a white man there before. So the natives there in Hawaii were very enamored to see such a big white man, so they took him as God, and they were worshiping him. And one day...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes. And one day he was walking across the rocks and he hit his foot on a rock and he began to bleed. When they saw the blood, they said, "He is not a God. He is just like us." So they killed him and ate him.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> ...were so worried, but this country is so big, and there's only twelve million people. More people live in New York City than in this whole country. And they say "overpopulation."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They would not allow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes, they don't allow.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And other countries, they are starving for want of milk. Therefore I say the United Nation simply barking dogs. What is the value if they cannot adjust? United Nation, all the nations should take advantage all the facilities offered, but that they will not allow. And they are named, "United." Just see. Farce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> In New Zealand they have a hundred million tons of surplus milk powder, and they can't sell it, so they decided to feed it to the pigs. They could send it all over the world.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> The rascals, they try to blame everything on Kṛṣṇa by saying, "Why is Kṛṣṇa letting people starve?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is giving them sufficient. They are mismanaging. Still, Kṛṣṇa is still bad. Envious. Kṛṣṇa created this earth. Did He say, "This is for the Australians. This is for the Americans"? Did He say? Why you are keeping so much land as "Australia"? That is also Kṛṣṇa's fault? Australia was never given to the Englishmen. They came and they, by force they took it. So similarly America, the land was there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They call this colonization, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is not cheater. The Kṛṣṇa's energy is so powerful that anyone who is a cheater, he will be cheated, that's all, automatically. [break] If you infect some disease, you'll have to suffer, automatically. It is not that the disease has to be injected. No. Because you have infected, you'll suffer. The same law is there. You have done this sinful. You'll suffer that. That is the cycle of birth and death. You have created mentality. You'll become the same animal, and you suffer. <span class="Italic">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]<span class="Italic">.</span> [break] ...we have.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They say it is the upside-down river. It is more blue on the bottom than it is on the top.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> In factories they put all of their waste into the river. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda, last night you were describing how people serve their dogs. And now, in the Western countries, they have restaurants where you can take your dog, and he sits at the table with you and they serve a meal for him. And they have catering services. You can call up, and they will bring a special meal to your dog, so he can eat at his home. They have beauty parlors for dogs, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they have taken dogs as God. According to Vedic civilization, dog is untouchable. [break] ...all the centers, then how many days it takes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> To visit all of our centers in the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Europe, America? That is world round.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> About three months if you stayed one day in each center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, one day only?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Some time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Some time" means five to seven days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Say average, six days.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At least a half a year, six months, seven months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, so much time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Some of the temples are very small, though.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, average...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They can come to the big temple. Like here we have three centers. They all come here. Say the big ones in America, there's about six, six, seven big temples which the others can go to. They have facility to accommodate them. Then six or seven temples would be about a month and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And similarly six and seven in Europe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Europe, there are.... England, France, and Germany. No, that's big. Say about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Switzerland.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> So we will make propaganda several months before the festival.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can go to the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They are claiming we make too much mess on the streets after the festival, too many flowers on the streets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is a festival. There must be crowd. You have no festival? Unfortunate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They have festival, and it's beer cans, not flowers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you must fight to the court. How they can stop? It is our religious function. (pause) [break] ...to curb down this movement. In Europe, America, Australia...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Things are to stop their farms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think so. They have gone deliberately. We are against cow-killing, so if the movement increases, then their cow-killing may be jeopardized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Then they'd have to close many farms. On the grounds that milk causes hepatitis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> ...they'd have to close many farms. The government gives aid to so many different groups, but they will not give any aid to our group, although we are doing the most work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "Kṛṣṇa..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No, we are too much revolutionary for them, our lifestyle, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they do not like this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Just like those people who came yesterday. They could appreciate out movement, but if they felt that we jeopardized their job or something of that nature, then they would go against us, 'cause we are very small, but if we became very popular movement, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Go on with our work.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, and we're.... (interference)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hayagrīva edited. He thought, "cattle-raising." Not "cattle-raising," but the word.... There.... It is mistranslation. It is <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya,</span> "giving protection to the cows." Especially mentioned, <span class="Italic">go-rakṣya,</span> not otherwise. The animal-eaters may take other animals, but not cow. They can take the pig, goats, lambs, rabbits, so many others, if they at all want to eat meat, birds, these so many. There is no such mention that "Animals should be protected," no. "Cows should be protected." That is Kṛṣṇa's order. [break] They have decided to kill the cow. They have decided, "No brain. Eat." And our prayer is <span class="Italic">go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca,</span> "to do good to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> and the cows." Actually it is revolutionary to the modern age. But how it is possible we say otherwise? That Bon Mahārāja came and said, "Right? Am I right?" (?) When Bon Mahārāja here.... When our students said something, "Oh, that you cannot say. That you cannot say." He said like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yeah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Devotees, we're preaching along the lines that we're preaching, and he was saying, "You cannot say this"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Just like we don't say, "You are rascal." We say, "Kṛṣṇa says you are rascal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> "So you are saying Kṛṣṇa cannot say?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Na dhanaṁ na janaṁ na sundarīm</span> [Cc. Antya 20.29, <span class="calibre3">Śikṣāṣṭaka</span> 4]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's looking for some following.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He cannot hit the heart.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was begging, "Give me. Give me (indistinct) (transportion check?)" Who is the rascal that he'll give him (transportion?)? What he is? But he is such a fool, he's begging, "Give me (transportion check?)." Why they'll give you? Then what benefit they'll derive? But he has no common sense to think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is what I think this disease is, with the Siddha's group, is they are looking for followers, and they do not preach in your style because they would not attract people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīdhara's group?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śrīdhara Svāmī?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No, Siddha-svarūpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Siddha-svarūpa, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> They are after followers, and they do not speak strongly, for people would go away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In one sense it's also confirmed by Rūpa Gosvāmī, <span class="Italic">yena tena prakāreṇa manaḥ kṛṣṇe niveśayet, sarve vidhi-niṣedhā syur...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That "First of all help people to think of Kṛṣṇa, and then later on, the rules and regulations..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> But we follow in the footsteps.... <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> We must follow what the spiritual master is doing. We cannot create our own way. Then we will not be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's true, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> That is their idea. They have created their own way to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that idea is there. They are thinking of their own way. That is bad. We have got so much, so many literatures. They are printing their own literature and.... That is disturbing, yes. What he'll prepare? He's not a liberated person. He's thinking, somebody said, that "I'll give my interpretation on <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span>" If these things are going, they are.... It is against our principles. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> You know how to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Therefore I follow. I don't even know what Kṛṣṇa is. I'm just trying to follow. Therefore that will be successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is my preaching. What Kṛṣṇa said, you say as it is. Don't change. How you can give interpretation? And if he thinks that he can give another interpretation, what is this nonsense? Then he's not following guru or Kṛṣṇa, both. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to receive the mercy of guru and Kṛṣṇa. Through guru, Kṛṣṇa's mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> If they go on like this, can this be considered <span class="Italic">sampradāya-vihīna ye mantras te viphalaṁ mataḥ</span>? That is, their <span class="Italic">mantra</span> is not so effective if people are surrendering to Kṛṣṇa. Just like milk touched with the lips.... (end)</div>
