<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no more desire of material enjoyment he is fit for <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Anyone who sees: "Oh, this car is very nice. This beautiful wife is very... A very beautiful woman is very nice," he should not think of taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa. Viṣa-bhakṣaṇād apy asādhu:</span> "Such desires is most abominable, more than taking poison." To commit suicide by taking poison is most abominable thing, because he's going to be a ghost. He'll be punished to become a ghost, those who commit suicide. Or, if one is suddenly killed and he has so many desires, he becomes ghost. Therefore <span class="Italic">viṣa-bhakṣaṇa,</span> taking poison, and die untimely, is most abominable, or commit suicide. By the material law also, to attempt to commit suicide is criminal. You know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is criminal. (Bengali) If you take <span class="Italic">s annyāsa...</span> Just like there are so many <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> for filling up the belly. Wherever you go they give some alms. But in..., outside India, who cares for the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>? Then why you should be eager to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and cheat yourself? You cannot cheat others, but you can cheat yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Outside India a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> will starve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) So I do not know why our disciples are so anxious to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> at least those who are outside. Everyone comes: "Give me <span class="Italic">sannyāsa."</span> What is the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Freedom from authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh? Who cares him, for authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, they, they don't want to take order as <span class="Italic">brahmacārī. </span>If they're <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> they think they can do as they feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They all want to become leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what kind of leader? If you cannot lead others, what kind of leader?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's why a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you mislead them, if you mislead them, then what is the use of taking leadership?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That's why that system where a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is recommended for one year and then he proves himself by doing some extraordinary preaching work is a very good system. Otherwise, anyone just comes and by pressurizing and begging and pleading, then they try to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Then they don't stay to the path.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa</span> means ultimate success, because this human life is meant for becoming disgusted with this material life: "No more." Material life means to take a body and enjoy this material <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidrā,</span> sleeping twenty-four hours, eating like elephant, and sex life like a monkey, these animals. This is material life, eating, sleeping, mating, and always afraid of. This is material life. And human life means to take freedom from these four things: no more afraid, no more sex, no more hankering after eating or sleeping. That is success. Everyone... You'll see in the sparrow in the morning. They're enjoying sex. So this is material life: eating, sleeping, mating and fearing. <span class="Italic">Āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca.</span> And spiritual life means to become free from all this nonsense. That is spiritual life. They do not know what is spiritual life. The whole world, they do not know what is spiritual life. This is spiritual life, to become free from these four abominable things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They are trying to increase these four things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means cheating themselves. What is the use of taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and cheat yourself? Material life means <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">,</span> repeatedly doing the same thing. Either as human being or as monkey or as a small ant or the demigods, but doing the business is the same, four things: eating, sleeping, mating and fearing. In different scale, doing the same business. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaḥ,</span> "again and again," <span class="Italic">carvita-carvaṇānām,</span> "chewing the chewed." If one is sober, he thinks that "These four business, I have done many, many lives, as sparrow, or as jackal, or as demigod, and I have got this human form. Again I am doing this? So what is benefit of this human form of life?" This is sense. "I got this valuable life, and I am still doing the same thing as dogs and cats and sparrows? Then what is the difference between me and the dogs?" That is sense. "What is my better engagement?" That better engagement is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then his life is successful. Otherwise what is the use of...? Again become a sparrow. Again wait for millions of years to come by evolutionary process to the human form of life. You see? This is going on. <span class="Italic">Punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they cannot control the sense, they are going in the darkest part of this material existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it seems that in youth the desire to enjoy is so much stronger than in old age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> It seems that in youth it is, the desire to enjoy is stronger than in old age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. An old man is still stronger, but instruments are finished. He cannot enjoy. But the desire is there. You don't think that old man has got less desire than the young man. He has got the desire, but his instrument is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So much frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not. He cannot use the instruments for enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So he's frustrated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Frustrated? Everyone. Whether young or not, everyone is frustrated. He says that the desire in old man... It is expected because he has gone through the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life. <span class="Italic">Gṛhastha</span> life is a concession for sex life. That's all. It is not needed. But those who are unable to avoid it-"All right, have for some time. Then become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span>" This is the process. It is not needed. So in old age, after going through these stages, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is learning how to stop this sex life, and then, if one is still unable-"All right, take concession for twenty-five years. Then give up this habit. Then take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span>" So that is the process, one who has gone through the stages, expected that he has no more... <span class="Italic">āra nārī bapa</span> (?) "I have done..." But generally, those who are not trained up, their desire is not diminished. They have got the... That you see in your country, Western country. Seventy-five, eighty years old, they are going to the nightclub.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Paying hundreds and thousands of dollars. Where is the...? He has lost all capacity, but still, he'll go. Still, he'll go. This is called <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the club, the son is also dancing with the girl, and the old father is dancing, and by chance, they come in contact. The Western civilization is for this, <span class="Italic">āhāra-nidrā-bhaya-maithuna,</span> eat voraciously, and all become diabetics. They have got diabetes club, association. That means... What is this? Diabetes is the result of voracious eating. That's all. In old age it becomes very prominent because he eats voraciously, but he cannot digest. And all these foodstuffs becomes... What is called? Glucose?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then diabetes. The beginning-<span class="Italic">āhāra,</span> eating. That gentleman, that doctor who has given us that review, he has. He's very learned man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Mr. Shannam?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. From France.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> The professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. He has mentioned, "From the Vedic standard, we are all uncivilized. We Westerners are uncivilized." He has admitted that. Actually they are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Yes, they will be shocked when they find this out because the idea is that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, just like a man is suffering from tuberculosis, and if his physician says that "You are attacked with tuberculosis," then he'll shocked. But the fact is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> They think that the Vedic culture is uncivilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They think because they are foolish rascals. They do not know what is the value of life. Big, big professor, he said, "Swamiji, after death everything is finished. There is no soul." Professor Kotovsky. This is their education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> And then they wonder why their sons become hippies and act like monkeys. Even though they are civilized, their sons are acting like monkeys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually we are introducing the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement to make the Western people civilized. Yes. So you should take it very seriously and behave with responsibility. If you also want, become again like that, then how you'll be able to preach? Then what is the use of preaching? What is time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Six-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [Break] ...process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So is it necessary to be fixed up to take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> or one should take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> to become fixed up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To become fixed, become <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> the other three processes are there, to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> to become <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> to become <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> stage by stage. But if one is able, he can take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> The stages are there, but if one is very competent, he can be given <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> And that competency is also very simple. If you become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, then you can immediately become competent. <span class="Italic">Sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as you fully engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then immediately you become more than a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Your Divine Grace is so merciful because the Western people, they are habituated to so many bad habits which weren't existed, existing in the Vedic time amongst the higher classes. Still, you are introducing all these things for them. Many times devotees, they don't take that seriously.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Bengali) <span class="Italic">Ṣaḍbhir bhaktiḥ prasidhyati.</span> What is this? [break] ...our field or some other field, but food must be there. If you don't eat sufficiently, how you'll be able to work? <span class="Italic">Yuktāhāra-vihārasya.</span> We are not after dry speculation. Practical. Eat sufficiently. Work sufficiently. Don't be lazy. But the danger is if you eat more than sufficient, then you'll sleep sufficient. Therefore <span class="Italic">yuktāhāra,</span> as much as you require, take it. Don't take more; don't take less. This is the law of nature. Just like salt. You salt require. But if you take more, it is useless, and if you take less, it is useless. If in the vegetable the salt is more, then it is uneatable; if it is less, uneatable. Take as it is. It is not that "Because there is ocean of salt, let me three pounds' salt." That is going on. "Oh, it is available? Now let me eat." And then he becomes sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> For somebody who can work more, then he can eat little more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> If somebody can work more, then he can eat more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Work more and work less doesn't matter. If he's actually hungry, he can take. Work must be there. If he does not work, what is the use of eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> This program...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> The difficulty that every person has not got the same mentality... One...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... That will depend on the preaching of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> What is this? Frame?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It's a hot iron building, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's the wrong type of renunciation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no renunciation. There is sense gratification. "I like this." That's all. He is thinking that "I am so renounced," but he's still satisfying his senses. That's all. As soon as we manufacture something, that is sense gratification. "I want to fulfill my desire. That's all." That is sense gratification. It may be I sit down on the tree, or I may sit down on the palace. That is sense... The basic principle is sense gratification. The other day I was talking about <span class="Italic">hīrā-cora</span> and <span class="Italic">kṣīrā-cora</span>. <span class="Italic">Hīrā</span> means diamond. And <span class="Italic">kṣīrā</span> means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Cucumber.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I shall steal. I shall steal one cucumber." And another one thinks, "If I steal, I shall steal the diamond." But the stealing propensity is there, <span class="Italic">hīrā-cora</span> or <span class="Italic">kṣīrā-cora.</span> "Well, I am stealing one..., only one cucumber. That is not very dangerous." But, but to the eyes of law, both of them are criminal, either you take <span class="Italic">hīrā</span> or <span class="Italic">kṣīrā.</span> Big thief and small thief, that's all. Thief. You are thief. So we manufacture concoction that "Yes, I have got this stealing propensity. So I'll not steal diamond. I'll steal <span class="Italic">kṣīrā,</span> not <span class="Italic">hīrā.</span>" This is only mental concoction, but he is a thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> I think this side's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm ?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> life is Kṛṣṇa allowing us to steal <span class="Italic">kṣīrā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes, <span class="Italic">kṣīrā-cora.</span> The prostitute-hunter is <span class="Italic">hīrā-cora,</span> and he's a <span class="Italic">kṣīrā-cora.</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] ...sense gratification that comes from renouncing like that, that's like the Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> By artificial renouncing everything, they're actually simply another form of sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not artificial. It is a process. We have to give up this sense gratification. Go through a process to trained up. Just like sometimes in the club there is artificial swimming. Is it not? Artificial swimming. That is not swimming. But to practice something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Or the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> But sometimes people who renounce like that, they become very proud. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagad-guru:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, are you pleased when your disciples do things like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagad-guru:</span> Are you pleased when your disciples do things like that...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artificial?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagad-guru:</span> Well, such things as Sharma Prabhu's doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know. What is that? What is his question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He asked if you're pleased if your disciples do things like Sharma, if they, like, go to live in trees and do artificial renunciation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he's trying. That's all. But active service is more important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Hm. That is your example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But something is better than nothing. If he goes, goes away to practice somewhere else, better give him chance to practice this. He's not doing anything bad. That is good. That is... But the better service is to be active servant, servitor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's your mercy on us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu, personally He gives example. He could have done at His home. Why He took <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and went out of home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> We have one boy at the temple, Śrīla Prabhupāda, and he doesn't want to do any work. He simply reads, and he says that "I will not do any work now, but when I become realized by reading," he says, "then I will engage in work."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he's reading. That is working. If he's... But he is sleeping, that is another thing. In the name of reading, sometimes we sleep. If that is not done, it is all right. He's reading. That's all right. But if he shows that "I am reading," but he's sleeping secretly, that is bad. To see that he's not sleeping, he's actually reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee (4):</span> He's life member also, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Hm? Anyway, if he's doing something, that's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I read where you said that if one simply reads, though, one cannot become realized in the philosophy. One has to actually do something practical, and then the realization will be there from what he has read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [break] ...are nondifferent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Service and reading are nondifferent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, if one is actually reading. Just like Rūpa Gosvāmī. He was reading. <span class="Italic">Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau.</span> But he must be expertly reading, not as a book worm, expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> And on the other hand, sometimes devotees are only engaged in service, and then, without reading, and they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But every, everyone... You cannot expect everyone is capable for reading.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They have desire to read, but they have no opportunity. And then in their service, they become... They lose sight sometimes, where they, because of fallen condition, they cannot remember Kṛṣṇa in their service. But while reading, one can easily..., cannot help but remember Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If he cannot remember Kṛṣṇa, he will sleep. That is the test. When you have seen so many reading but sleeping, that means there is no Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yāhāṅ kṛṣṇa tāhāṅ nāhi māyāra adhikāra.</span> Sleeping is <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> so if he's thinking of Kṛṣṇa, there cannot be sleeping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, I'm talking not about the reading half, but the service half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Service also... Everything depends on advancement in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. If Kṛṣṇa is there, either you read or work as a coolie, the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> You instructed that service is as good as reading, but only... We see that devotees only doing service without reading, then they become agitated in their mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there is no Kṛṣṇa. The real disease is there is no Kṛṣṇa. Therefore he'll be agitated, either reading or working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> So how can they, the Kṛṣṇa...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, if they... One must go through this practice. Everyone must attend the <span class="Italic">ārā</span>..., <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārātrika.</span> One must attend this. One must attend this. Otherwise no <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> If one says, "I am sick," no <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> "You are sick. You cannot digest. That's all." And sick, sleeping, and at the time of <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> voracious eating, that is not sickness. If you are sick, you cannot take food. Don't take. (end)</div>
