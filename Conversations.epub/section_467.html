<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...<i class="calibre3">kāma-rāja-vivarjitam, dharmāviruddho bhūteṣu kāmo 'smi bharatarṣabha</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (reads translation to Bg. 7.11 in German)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sex life, married couple, that is alright, not otherwise, that is sinful.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, just this objection was that in this statement of <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> doesn't clearly say no reason you should not have sex life outside of married life, they say they state religious principles, but this is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious principles means married life, otherwise cats and dogs. What is this? If everyone has without any limitation sex life, then what is the difference between cats and dogs? Religion means you are not cats and dogs because religion is in the human society, not in the cats and dogs' society.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the spiritual life there is no sex life. In the spiritual world there is no sex intercourse. There is no sex life. Although there is man and woman, there is no sex intercourse. By chanting the glories of God there in the spiritual world, they get so much great pleasure that is far beyond this pleasure of sex life. If you have something best then you forget low grade pleasure. So this sex pleasure is lower grade pleasure. It is not pleasure, it is illusion, but in material world this is the greatest pleasure. Therefore everyone they are coming back to this sex pleasure, everyone. Even so-called religionists and swamis, they are coming down to the sex pleasure. Because in this material world that is the only highest pleasure. So, so long one will be attracted by the sex pleasure it is still in the material world. And when one will be on the platform to spite (spit) on sex pleasure, then his spiritual life begins. That is stated by Yāmunācārya. (Sanskrit). Yāmunācārya, a great saintly person, he was formerly big king, so he said, "Since I have become Kṛṣṇa conscious and enjoying, since that time, as soon as I remember even sex life, I spite (spit) on it and my mouth becomes turned." (laughter) This is the test. Not that you become very advanced spiritualist and at the same time advance in sex life. That is not. (Sanskrit) That is the test that as soon as you are advanced in spiritual life, all these materialistic habits will be rejected automatically. This is the test. Four things are material demands-eating, satisfaction of the tongue or belly and satisfaction of the genital, <i class="calibre3">āhāra</i>, and sleeping and to become a good defender, defense measure. These are material necessity. And the one who is spiritually advanced, these things will be reduced, almost nil. What Christ says, Jesus Christ about sex life? What does he say?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Only in the married life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Only.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And in the future it will pass completely.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So even if you are married sex life can be material too.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is also regulated. When the wife is menstrual period, so after five days you can have sex life and as soon as she is pregnant, no more sex life. So, sex life is meant for progeny, not for sense pleasure. Even the animals, dogs, cats, they have a period for sex life and as soon as the female dog is pregnant, no more sex life. In certain months of the year they have sex life, not all the year. So even the dogs they follow regulation and we human being, we do not follow. The dogs have no restriction. The female dogs are naked and they can capture anyone, anywhere, but they do not have unless there are certain period. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Therefore in spiritual life restricted regulated sex life, is essential.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Religious is automatically regulated sex life?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is religious life. If in the name of religion it is sinful life, that is another thing. Alright Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] <i class="calibre3">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu</i>. <i class="calibre3">samaḥ sarveṣu</i>, <i class="calibre3">mad-bhaktiṁ labhate</i>. That is the stage of making advancement in devotional life. Equality. Equality is possible when we are on the platform of spiritual life. Otherwise the United Nations will never be able to unite. That is not possible. (indistinct) If they unite, if they try to unite on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then. Otherwise.... We are all part and parcel of God. Somehow or other we are all differently dressed, although we are one. (indistinct) Now just like you are Canadian, I am Indian. (indistinct). There are crows, there are pigeons, there are sparrows (indistinct). Why they are not quarreling? Simply you are designated European, Indian and Canadian, German, so we have to give up this designation. Then they will be united. Otherwise, but they are very much proud of these designations. Therefore, <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> means <i class="calibre3">sarvopādhi vinirmuktam</i> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]. When one is completely free from designation. The designation is (indistinct). And the whole world is being ruled by designation, "I am Indian", (indistinct). <i class="calibre3">Ahaṁ mameti<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 5.5.8]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There is a hierarchy of consciousness, of course, but it's not...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) if I try to develop my consciousness with designation, it will not be (indistinct) It will not be effective at least in the matter of advancing spiritual consciousness. That you have to see (indistinct). Now in our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement we have got men from all parts of the world, but they are not thinking in terms of their original national designation. They do not think that they are American or Indian or so on, or Hindu, Gujarati(?), <i class="calibre3">kṣatriya.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Of course there can be ambition that is essentially ego attached to an idea of achieving consciousness (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That consciousness will not help you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It won't.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that will rather check you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, exactly.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> it is said, <i class="calibre3">yaṁ yaṁ vāpi smaran loke tyajaty ante kalevaram<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 8.6]. At the time of death if I die with designation, then I will have to accept again the body. The mind if it contains contamination, he gets different types of bodies on account of mind being contaminated.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Contaminated?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like if you contaminate some disease, then you must develop that disease. Similarly, if your mind is contaminated with some material designation, then you have to.... By nature's law. <i class="calibre3">Kāraṇaṁ guṇa-saṅgo 'sya<span class="Italic"></span></i> [<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>13.22]. Because mind associated with a particular type of the modes of material nature, (indistinct). There are three qualities-<i class="calibre3">sattva-guṇa</i>, <i class="calibre3">rajo-guṇa</i>, <i class="calibre3">tamo-guṇa</i> and mixed up. At first mixing it becomes nine and again mixing up it becomes 81. Each quality there are thousands and thousands of varieties and that means by mixing up these qualities there are 8,400,000 species of life. So, it is by the God's law, nature's law, they take account of the particular color and award the quality. It is not man-made law. That there may some mistake. There is no mistake. If you have contaminated this disease, whether small pox or whatever or (indistinct), you must develop. Therefore desireless. Desireless means material desires. Material desires begins with this designation. Just like the child, he has got a childish body and he plays like a child. The same child when he'll get a youthful body (indistinct). The soul is the same but on account of the type of the body, he is acting. This is material. Small child in the childhood talks like nonsense, people enjoy it. But the same child when he is grown up, if he talks like a nonsense, people will call him nonsense, rascal. Why? The body has changed, the circumstances have changed. This is (indistinct) that we have changed this body and on account of the bodily situation we are acting different. That they do not understand. There is not school or college, they do not know about the soul and soul changing different positions, different bodies. In this way he remains materially entangled and the real relief is to get out of this bodily consciousness and advance in spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So, <i class="calibre3">bhakti</i> is really a process of decontaminating the mind?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (indistinct) That is the real education. And all this rascal education will not help because all this education will keep you within this material body. The real relief is how to get you out of this material entanglement. <i class="calibre3">Tyaktva dehaṁ punar janma<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 4.9]. (indistinct) After giving up this material body, no more acceptance of this material body. That is real education. And <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i> says <i class="calibre3">pitā na sa syāj jananī na sā syāt</i>, <i class="calibre3">gurur na sa syāt</i>, <i class="calibre3">na mocayed yaḥ samupeta-mṛtyum</i>. There is no need of becoming father unless you train up your child to accept no more this material body. The child should be trained up by the father. The guru should train up the disciple in such a way that the disciple or the child or the student will not have to accept any more material body. (indistinct) The whole Vedic education system how to stop acceptance of material body. That is called <i class="calibre3">mukti</i>. <i class="calibre3">Mukti</i>, the definition of <i class="calibre3">mukti</i> is given in the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i>, <i class="calibre3">muktir hitvānyathā rūpam</i>. <i class="calibre3">Mukti</i> means when one is able to give up another form of body. He has got his own body, spiritual body, but so long as he has to accept another form of body, he is conditioned. <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavata</i>, <i class="calibre3">muktir hitvānyathā rūpam sva-rūpeṇa vyavasthitiḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Mukti</i> means to stay in his original spiritual form. Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to educate people how to achieve the original consciousness, that is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. Well, but this in one form or another is the aim of any true tradition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> True?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Tradition, religion.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Every teaching.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) tradition, they are all material. They are also designation. I'm thinking I am Hindu, you are thinking Christian, he is thinking this, these are all designation.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Within each of these there is the esoteric.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Whatever it is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is material. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <i class="calibre3">sarva dharmān parityajya</i> [Bg. 18.66]. "Give up all these types of false religions." <i class="calibre3">Mam ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</i>. That means come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <i class="calibre3">Ekam</i>, anyone. So unless one becomes fully Kṛṣṇa conscious, he's in trouble. (indistinct) And our difficulty is that when we want to convince a person on Kṛṣṇa consciousness, he thinks that I am Hindu, I am Christian, I am Mohammedan. I am trying to proselytize, that is (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> No, it was not that I was really saying. Rather that what I have heard from others comes to the same thing as you were saying.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others, if they try for the same thing, then it is alright. Because that type of religion, that system of religion, is first-class which teaches people to come to the platform of God consciousness, to love God, then that is first-class religious system. It doesn't matter what is the designation. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The process of change of consciousness which is actually taking place in you under many influences, I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Under many influences.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, influence should be only Kṛṣṇa or God. Kṛṣṇa, when we speak of Kṛṣṇa, God, but they have no clear idea what is God. How does He speak, how does He act. Where does He live. What is His form. What is his color. Nobody knows. Ask any religious people, "Do you know about all these?" (tape too faint to hear) (indistinct) If they think about it at all. First of all, generally they think of something impersonal or void. The Buddhists they think God is zero. And others they think God has no form. So, two classes. The Hindus they think God has not particular form, (indistinct). And you can imagine any of them(?) That is Śaṅkara. The <i class="calibre3">pañcopāsanā</i>. But still Śaṅkara is very careful. He has given five particular forms-the Goddess Durgā, Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Siva, the sun. Therefore there are sections-the sun worshipers, the fire worshipers. Originally, (indistinct). That is Vedic culture. Their Vedic culture means many demigods. But the original God is accepted, Viṣṇu. And original to Viṣṇu is Kṛṣṇa. <i class="calibre3">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]. Kṛṣṇa also says, <i class="calibre3">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 7.7]. "There is no superior form or authority than Me." That is confirmed by Lord Brahmā, <i class="calibre3">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇah <span class="Italic"></span></i>[Bs. 5.1]. Kṛṣṇa is controller. There are different grades of controller but the supreme controller is Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says <i class="calibre3">mām ekam</i>, "Unto Me, no one else." Now our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is trying to convince people to give Him our attention, therefore we have published so many books only about Kṛṣṇa. On every page you'll find Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa. Either in <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa Book</i> or in <i class="calibre3">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</i>, or in the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam</i> or in <i class="calibre3">Nectar of Devotion</i>, <i class="calibre3">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</i>. The word(?) is Kṛṣṇa, that is simply explained in the (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What is the word actually? "Kr" is the root for making, isn't it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, krs.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, krs means <i class="calibre3">karṣati</i>, attraction. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> About?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. India, formerly your country was part of India and you belonged to the same culture. So far I understand, Iran means Aryan? So Aryan culture was practically all over the world. Aryan culture.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Krs then as attractiveness and as cultivator. In Greek my name is also cultivator.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> In Greek, the origin of my name is cultivator. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there is a Greek word for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a word in Greek. He is called Kristo. Kṛṣṇa is sometimes pronounced by ordinary man as Kristo and that Kristo word means love. That is the other Greek word and from that Kristo, the word Christ has come.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct) Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is some connection with Kṛṣṇa (indistinct). What is that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> There are so many parallels between Kṛṣṇa and Christ.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Born in a cave. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <i class="calibre3">Mamaivāṁśo jīva-loke jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ</i>, <i class="calibre3">manaḥ sasthanindriyani prakṛti-sthani karsati<span class="Italic"></span></i> [Bg. 15.7<span class="Italic">]</span>. "The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal, fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the position of the conditioned souls that they are struggling for existence. Instead of finding out how to come to the original consciousness and that is struggle. Kṛṣṇa means love. So everyone is struggling hard how to reach the platform of love. So many institutions-philanthropic, international, United Nations. The only attempt, how to love each other. But they'll struggle, they'll not attain the platform, simply struggle. There have been so many attempts, even the favorite example, the United Nations. How much they are doing and people have got the idea of philanthropism, countryism, communism, communityism, this ism, that ism. The only thing is they are trying to come to the platform of love.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are manufacturing their own way. But Kṛṣṇa showed, "Not in this way, simply make Me center and the whole thing (indistinct)." But that they'll not do. They'll do in their own way, concocting some idea. And your idea will clash with me, my idea will clash with you, the same struggle continues. The communists will not agree with the others, the capitalists. The capitalist will not agree. But they are struggling to come to that, the platform of love.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, it's the inter-attractiveness even on a planetary scale that holds the world.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu gives very perfect formula-that you sit together, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and everything (indistinct). That also (indistinct). There is no loss, let us make an experiment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the loss if we sit together and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa? And if there is some gain (indistinct) If you propose this in the United Nations do you think (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Like we did together in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have seen it? They are very much eager.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So many people.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are very much eager. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Eager?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the other, the communist and the other (indistinct). I have seen many big, big officers they are chanting returning from the office and they are chanting and dancing. (indistinct) 20,000, 30,000. (indistinct) Now the government did not give us again that place in Delhi.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Last time when we came, there they gave.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> LIC Grounds(?)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> LIC Grounds(?)?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They gave us that (indistinct) Park.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in the jungle, nobody could reach, and they gave us that place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And still there were no less than (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (laughs)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It was not easily accessible, the motorcar cannot go. You have to leave your car three miles away (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I know the place.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He knows that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It is a difficult thing to get to.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and they gave us that park and at the last moment they rejected. First of all they gave then at the last moment the municipality thought that this land cannot be given to any religion. And offered that (indistinct). So we had no other alternative. (indistinct) And the government indirectly giving us so much hindrance. They do not like it. One of the important members (indistinct), he frankly said that we do not want that your movement will increase very fast in India. Because they know it, (indistinct), that India is naturally inclined to Kṛṣṇa. And if the selected people of the world combine together and push this movement in India, the whole program of the modern leaders (indistinct) That's a fact. And that was my (indistinct) I wanted to start this movement from India but nobody cooperated, so then I decided to come to America and my plan was successful.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> What was your connection with McGill? I heard...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was(?)...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You published first with McGill?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Bhaktivinoda probably(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Bhaktivinoda.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He sent his first book.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In 1896. Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was the first origin of this movement. But he simply thought of it and he was expecting that some other persons will take up the work. So somebody says.... [break] (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <i class="calibre3">Teachings of Lord Caitanya</i>, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Well, I'm very happy to have this chance to be with you. How long will you be here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A few days.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's all? And then?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going to India. (indistinct) Lord Caitanya's birth anniversary and open our Vṛndāvana temple. In Bombay we have got very nice land purchased and the government will not give us sanction for the temple.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Hm!</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (barely audible) (indistinct) through another friend (indistinct). The governor was (indistinct). He's my friend, I requested him, "You request the government to give us sanction." So he is very ardently pressing, explaining the whole thing about my position that he is member of this movement and still (indistinct). He has said no, but (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You know when I had Mr. Trudeau, our prime minister, visit India in '71, first place I took him was at Vṛndāvana.</div>
