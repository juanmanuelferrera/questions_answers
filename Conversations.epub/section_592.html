<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What time do you want to go there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Perhaps around... When is convenient? Ten o'clock? Before the massage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...fed up with so-called religion. Therefore they're angry. But when they find this is real, genuine, everyone will accept. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> ...wants to come and see you, he likes your movement very much. He has written one review of one of your books. He also met you I think briefly. He is from Boston, Mr. Leo Prudden, Professor Leo Prudden. Now he lives here in Los Angeles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There will be many professors coming over to see you while you are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> We'll discuss it with Upendra when is the best time. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...hīna paśubhiḥ samānaḥ.</span> "As soon as one become bereft of religion, he's animal." That's all. That is the difference between animals and man. They think to become polished animal is advancement of civilization. To become lion is advancement of civilization. "Because I am stronger than the dog therefore I am civilized." Americans think like that. "Because we are stronger than the Chinese dog or Russian cat, therefore I am civilized." (laughs) This is going on. "Because I am tiger, I am lion..." He doesn't think that after, "You be tiger or lion; You are animal." Just see. [break] <span class="Italic">...puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] So many dogs, "best friends." [break] ...they have erased, "No dogs on beach," "Dogs on beach." (laughter) Just see how lawful they are. [break] How many books are pending? Rāmeśvara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think we have just added one more in the Sixth Canto since you have started translating it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. How many books are pending?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Still about seventeen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have just sent <span class="Italic">Madhya Two...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not complete?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have finished. I mean to edit, editing?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you get it corrected. I am present. I will do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think when Nitāi and Jagannātha come, Śrīla Prabhupāda, all the books will come out within a few months, all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not a few months. I want these seventeen pending books must be printed within two months. That I want. Otherwise disqualification. Yes. [break] ...be done. Your so many GBC's are here, and you are also here, I am also here. Decide! It must be done. It is too much delay. [break] ...constructing something here, but stopped? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No, they just use that for cleaning the beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They use that for cleaning up the garbage on the beach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> I think this is some sort of volley ball or tennis that goes on inside there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inside the wall...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Inside the wall there's some sort of sports arena, tennis and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] Satsvarūpa Mahārāja, what is your report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Report?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, er...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Standing order?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They're still getting them in public libraries in Detroit...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have got standing order from Oxford University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> You heard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they have got, sent me the copy of the standing order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Oh, that's wonderful. They're getting letters from big professors at Cambridge and Oxford in praise of the books. They'll be very, very useful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> [break] ...professors are very impressed with your books, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> All the professors are very impressed with your books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Impressed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> We just got a review published in a magazine called Choice which is used... It's very important. It's used by all the libraries all over the country, and the review was excellent. They didn't say one bad thing. You should see that review.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where? You have got that copy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We have copy. I can bring it in today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That one review does more work than we could do by traveling all over the country for a year. Because the librarians, when we go to them, they say, "Well, we usually order our books from this Choice magazine." But now we're in it. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is helping us. Take advantage of it. [break] Vyāsadeva compiled <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> for this purpose. <span class="Italic">Anartha upasamam sākṣād bhakti-yogam adhokṣaja.</span> These <span class="Italic">lokasya ajānataḥ,</span> people are suffering on account of ignorance, so to give them proper knowledge, he made this <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> [break] Who can become more learned than Vyāsadeva? Therefore he is known as <span class="Italic">vidvān</span>, the most, supreme learned. He made this <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> to help these rascals who are spoiling their life only in sense gratification. [break] Life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapo divyaṁ putrakā yena śuddhyed [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know that our existentional condition is impure. The question does not arise that "I do not wish to die. Why there is death?" They are so dull-headed, this question does not... They are trying to solve so many question, but this question does not arise in their mind, that "I don't wish to die. Why death is forced upon me?" Inquire. Come on, all philosophers and scientists, come and make an inquiry commission, that "I don't want to die. The death is forced upon me. I don't want to become old man, and it is forced upon me. What is the reason?" Therefore they are rascals. The prime problem, they have set aside. Big, big scientists... That Professor Einstein and other, other, they are big, big scientists. They do not consider this question, that "I am a big scientist. So I am also going to die. So why it is?" That question, they have set aside. And they manufacture atom bomb to make dead very easy, not to stop death, but death-making very easily available. This is scientific. Hmm? Is that scientific?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Everyone is dying, and they accelerate death. And that is taken as scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They are also making research how to stop death.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They're making... But it's useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is in our hands; that is not in their hands.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Some time back I was reading an article on an airplane, one of those airline news magazines, about the science of gerontology, the science of putting off death or stopping death. They say, "Within twenty-thirty years we will have stopped it. We will even reverse the process of old age. We'll become younger." That was their claim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can do it-that is credit. But what is this credit, that people are dying and you discover atom bomb to accelerate death very quickly? If they are thinking like that, then sanity is coming. At least, they are thinking like that, that "Why death should not be stopped?" That will be credit if they can do so, but at least this question, it comes. Then they become human being, not dogs. And so long this question does not come, they are cats and dogs. This is <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This is the inquiry. Sanātana Gosvāmī when he approached Caitanya Mahāprabhu he first questioned this, <span class="Italic">ke āmi, keno more jape tāpa-traya:</span> "I was minister. That's all right. But I do not know why I shall accept death. Therefore I have come to You." This is minister, intelligence, that "People praise me, I am minister, I am very learned scholar, but I do not know why I am under the tribulations of three-fold miseries, and what is my position." <span class="Italic">Ke āmi, keno more jape tapa-traya:</span> "Who I am? I don't want all these things, why they are troubling me?" <span class="Italic">Grāmya-vyavahāre paṇḍita, tai satya kori mani:</span> "These fools and rascals, they call me, I am very learned scholar, and I also accept it, but I do not know why I am suffering." This is Sanātana Gosvāmī's question. So what they are doing? They are making research?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who are they? Very important men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Well, it just said... The magazine was not terribly detailed. It just said that many scientists involved in this are claiming that within twenty-thirty years they will reverse the aging processes. I think it is a bogus claim actually. They dream all kinds of things like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say when a person is born, there is a kind of clock inside them that runs so long. If they can change that clock, then they'll make it stretch out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Most of these big philosophers don't ever think of that question, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> These big philosophers never think of that question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because they have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficult subject matter, they set aside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They avoid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> But this gerontology is not a major subject in any of the universities yet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They know, "It is not possible by us." They know it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> I was speaking with Professor Stahl about this point in Berkeley. And he also had no answers for this question. He thought that there was no such thing as eternal life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, then, therefore you are a rascal. Then why you are struggling to live? Why, when you are sick, why do you call doctor, physician? Why this tendency? Why you are making research in medical science, opening hospital? Die. Why you are not willing to die? Then what is the answer? He says, "There is no such thing as eternity," but why you are struggling for eternity? Then what is the answer? Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Well, when we tell them your philosophy, Śrīla Prabhupāda, he became silent. The one... We were having a debate, and the one chairman of the debate, he then he turned to Mr. Stahl. He said, "So what do you think of this answer, Mr. Philosopher?" And Mr. Stahl just sat there very quiet. He couldn't say anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Everyone is trying to live. That is Darwin's theory also, "struggle for existence." So why you are trying to exist if there is no such thing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Well, they say, "We don't mind if we're not eternal, but we want to live as long as possible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That is my question. Why? Why this tendency?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Some years back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means it is unnatural. "I am eternal, but this death has been forced upon me. That is unnatural." That is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> Some time back in the newspaper... This old president of America, Harry Truman, died, and it mentioned that he was eighty-eight years old and that in the last eight years he had been in and out of the hospital ten times for surgery. So in eight years he had been operated on ten times. At eighty-eight years old he was still trying to live, and finally he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Revatīnandana:</span> So much misery; still, he would not die. He tolerated all these operations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This Professor Stahl, he was saying that his experience is that everything is changing and temporary. So therefore he was thinking that that is the nature of all things, that they are temporary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Temporary, this (indistinct). Why this "temporary" word has come into existence unless there is the opposite, "eternal"? Why do you use this word, "temporary"? When you say, "It is fraud," and there must be something as honesty. Otherwise, why this "fraud" has come? Hm? We say, "This is light"-means there is something as darkness. This is relative world. The Professor Einstein said relativity. This is relative: as soon as there is darkness, there must be light. Otherwise, how you understand light and darkness? So unless there is eternity, how do you bring this word, "temporary"? What is their answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They have no answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless there is father, there is no meaning of the word son. Unless there is husband, there is no meaning of the word wife. This is the relative world, and they are accepting this relativity. So how they can deny? As soon as you "temporary" say, you must accept there is eternity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> We were telling him that although everything is changing, he was still existing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now, existing, but why you are in change? That is the question. "I am existing," that we say, but we are trying to solve the problem of changing. But this changing is not very happy, to die and again accept another body and remain to, in the womb of the mother to develop that body in an airtight condition. So why these foolish persons do not take it as very miserable? And with the risk of being killed by the mother. Nowadays their abortion and killing. So is it very nice life, that you die and you enter into the mother's womb to develop another body? And that also not secure. Is that very nice life? [break] Write many articles on this subject matter and prove them that "You are all fools." [break] ...major problem, they have left aside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> The main problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Yes. And Kṛṣṇa says, therefore, "These are your real problems: <span class="Italic">janma-mṛtyu-jarā-vyādhi duḥkha-doṣānudarśanam [Bg. 13.9].</span> If you are intelligent, then you should keep always in your front these problems."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They think that we're avoiding the real problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> They think that we're avoiding the real problems because we're not doing business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are not doing business? We are doing the best business. You are working hard day and night, and without working, we are living comfortably. They cannot dream of. [break] ...is their envy, that "These people, without doing anything they are living so comfortably. And we are working so hard day and night." [break] Yes, this is envious. [break] He is searching some fish? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Clams.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> (break ) ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, we have scheduled some meetings with many professors there, from this Graduate Theological Union and other places. Dr. Judah will be there and some of his associates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dr. Judah, he wanted to see me earlier, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes, he'll be coming here probably on Tuesday or Wednesday. He's just coming from Boston. They had a big library convention there for the theological schools in the United States. So he had to go to speak at that, and then he'll be coming back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Did he speak anything about Hare Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> He's always speaking about this Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. (Prabhupāda chuckles) He gave one lecture just about two weeks ago. It was very very nice. I attended, and I was also speaking something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he is serious about studying this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is nice. Anyone who is serious, he will appreciate. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> ...that any intelligent person who hears this philosophy and reads your books, he'll have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> No one can even challenge. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are giving standing orders. They understand this is worthly. [break] ...is up? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> A little bit early still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then we can go this way. [break] ...many rooms are there in the new house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Oh, there are many rooms. Two very, very large rooms, at least as big as the temple room in San Francisco, er, in Los Angeles, excuse me. Two rooms that big. Then there's about four rooms for living quarters, a big kitchen, and then several offices, and then a nice quarters for Your Divine Grace with a bath, with a shower right there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What it was before?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> It was a Mormon church.</div>
