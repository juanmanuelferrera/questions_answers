<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> It's not in good order Swamiji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> It's not in good order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which order?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Well, my house where I live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I say that you purchase one house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Participate in one house?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Purchase. Buy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Oh. Am I gonna dig gold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, you have no money?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> To buy a house? I wish I did. I'd take all of the disciples and put 'em all in one house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You just make one down payment, and they will pay monthly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa will help you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Kṛṣṇa!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Sell your car!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> I've got a bad back. I can't walk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Your car helps your back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, your car is so nice. If I would have remained here, I would ask you to donate this car to the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Can never tell what I do for (Prabhupāda chuckling) all my sisters and my brothers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> These are all my sisters and brothers, Swamiji. Right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. certainly. So don't worry. Kṛṣṇa will give you better place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That was a disappointment because we almost, almost had it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No question of disappointment. In Los Angeles, we had so many disappointments. At last, we got very nice place. Now we are after bigger place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Tell Swamiji about the church we want to get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> The church...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then that article has worked adversely?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Yeah. The real estate man said if it had only come out a week later, he said, "You'd be in."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So publicity like this is not good for us, that people are thinking we are hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Yes. That's true, Swamiji. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then you should not give publicity. You must even in the beginning verify that we are not hippies. Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is not for hippies. In many places this is a notion, that we are hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Montreal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Montreal too, the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Yes, but a lot of hippies have gone back to... They've went to Florida, Swamiji. Thousands of hippies went back to Florida. They left Boston.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are, most of them, in Hawaii also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Oh, there's some in Hawaii too?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Prabhupāda, I think he was worried because... [Break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...all right. We don't hate hippies. We have nothing... But these people misunderstand. That is... That is another thing. We welcome everyone. We have no such distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Oh, yes, yes. Everyone can come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Kṛṣṇa's good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Kṛṣṇa wants a better place for us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Kṛṣṇa wants a better place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughing) And also it is a fact that many of our students have come from the hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Almost all of them. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are our best candidates. So you can advertise that "We are not hippies, but we are converting many hippies to the sane condition of life." That's a fact. They are searching after something better, but they have no leader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Yes, that's true. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no leader. Now, if they come to us seriously, they get the right thing. But that is also their defect. When we propose, "Come and take this Kṛṣṇa," they don't want. They want that marijuana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Prabhupāda, my mother had the idea of going to rich parents who are very anxious about their children who've become hippies and saying that this movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you should write article that "We are not hippies, but we are converting hippies to the sane condition. So father, mothers, who are anxious for their children, let them send their children to us. We take care." In this way you make impression in the public mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> And also they make donations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So our New Vrindaban scheme is there. Let them help and send their children. We make just opposite number of hippies. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Swamiji, but that has to advertised in papers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you do it? This is a service. You can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Yes, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are acquainted with so many people. You are experienced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> But I mean so that people can read it. So they'll understand it's not hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You go to responsible men and see, that "This is a nice movement. Why don't you patronize it to save your country's from the hippies' falling down, confusion?" We are saving. Practically this society is giving the best service to your country. They should appreciate, but they should not misunderstand us. How we can be hippies? We completely... That is also said. How foolish man he is, that, er... In that article, Satsvarūpa, in that article, it is clearly stated that we are refusing all these things. How they conclude that we are hippies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> It wasn't a bad article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh! What a nonsense he is!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> He is worried that hippies come to the ceremonies to see us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> I think that's why he's worried about hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Candanācārya:</span> Because he saw photographs that audience was hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So that we cannot cancel: "These hippies are not admitted." No. We admit everyone. We cannot say that "Such and such person cannot enter into our temple." We cannot say. Everyone is welcome. Everyone is welcome. And, if they do not come, how they'll converted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> I think that the confusion is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We cannot say, just like, in some hotels, that "Such and such persons are not admitted." No. We cannot. We admit everyone. Our mission is to elevate persons from down state of life to the highest state of life. So everyone is in down state. Lord Jesus Christ also said that "You do not hate the sinners, but hate sin." Is not that, Lord Jesus Christ said? So hippies may be sinners. We raise them to the pious life. But we say, "Don't do this. Don't do this sinful act. Don't take intoxication. Don't do this. Don't do this." We hate sin, not the sinners. Actually. If we hate sinners, then where is the possibility of preaching?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> If the hippies would come, come, come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Then you can get them out of this hippie into Christian conscience. See.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Yes. I can understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. All right. Kṛṣṇa will see. So you just give service to Kṛṣṇa, impressing people that these Kṛṣṇa conscious people are not hippies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Oh, yes! I told a lot of people. You know, Swamiji, the first time when I heard about 95 Glenville Avenue, the first time, a woman told me that, she says, "You know," she says, "gypsies, we have neighbors, gypsies on the street." "Gypsies! I haven't seen any gypsies." Well, I put my shoes. I went downstairs. I went to the door and I start reading. I says, "This is spiritual. This is beautiful. This is spiritual." I forgot right away. So she came to the door, Jadurani. She came to the door and she said, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," and she said, "Come in." I came in and she started talking to me and that's... I got started. So when I seen her, I said, "That's not gypsies. That's not gypsies." And I explained it to her. "Oh," she said, "I seen the curtains in the window," she said, "and I thought they were gypsies." "Oh, well," I explained it to her. "Oh," I says. I let her have it, there was no gypsies there. So she used to see me coming down to got to the temple. So nice, yeah? Do you like that place, Swamiji?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> Where the disciples are now, on Glenville Avenue? Or do you think that you need another place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, sometimes the, some children disturb. They broke...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Miss Rose:</span> No. Oh, I know they broke the windows. I know that. You know, Swamiji, it's very hard to find apartments, and, Swamiji, they're very expensive. $125, $135, $145 dollars a month, the apartments are. See. Yeah. And they're very, very hard to find. And sometimes I want to get out of there myself. Because, I mean, there is so many... It's really turning out to be kind of a bad, a lot of children there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let us see. As Kṛṣṇa desires. Begin <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Chant. (end)</div>
