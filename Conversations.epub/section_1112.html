Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">. Jñāna</span> and <span class="Italic">karma,</span> these are bondage. <span class="Italic">Karmī, jñānī,</span> yogi-they are especially bewildered. They want something, but still they say that "I am now renounced." So long there is want, he cannot be renounced. Renounced means no more want. <span class="Italic">Svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi:</span> "I am fully satisfied now. I don't want any..." <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ manyate nādhikaṁ tataḥ.</span> "I have got such a nice thing that I have no aspiration for getting any more." That is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">. Svamin kṛtartho 'smi.</span> So this is Vedic civilization, that at a certain stage one should forget that "I belong to this family, I belong to this society, I belong to this nation, and so on," there are. <span class="Italic">Sva-dhīḥ kalatrādiṣu. Sva-dhīḥ:</span> "My own men, my kinsmen." This is <span class="Italic">sva-dhīḥ.</span> And beginning from <span class="Italic">kalatrādiṣu. Kalatra</span> means wife. Wife is the beginning of expansion. From wife, child; from child to grandchild; grandchild to great-grandchild; and so on, so on. <span class="Italic">Stri</span> means "which increases." <span class="Italic">Kalatrādiṣu.</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Swamiji, I get two thoughts. Number one: having acquired a family, I am willing to renounce, but would I not be running away from the responsibility, in the name of Lord Kṛṣṇa, for the bringing up and educating the children? And second thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot educate, neither you bring. This is <span class="Italic">māyā. </span> Do you think... Do you think that only in your presence your children will be happy? There are... Just see here in the corner, the father, mother, and the child is always, twenty-four hours, crying. The father, mother, is there. They are poor men, they are taking care, but still, the child is unhappy; it is crying twenty-four hours. There are many you'll find. So does it mean that in the presence of father, mother, a child is happy? Everyone is being conducted by his destiny. The father, mother, may be there or may not be there; his destiny will go on. This is the law of nature. You see here. Do you mean to say, because that man is poor, he's not taking care of the child? Why the child is crying twenty-four hours? So if one child is made to cry by his destiny, even in the presence of his father, mother, he has to cry. Nobody can make him happy. So this is called illusion, that "I am doing." <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> A rascal, he thinks like that. But it is not the fact. The fact is <span class="Italic">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ.</span> His destiny or her destiny is to suffer. So even though father, mother... Suppose a rich man's son is sick. He has engaged good physician, good doctor. Does it mean that he will guarantee life? Then what is the principle? <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau.</span> Prahlāda Mahārāja said that "It is not a fact that when the children are under the protection of father and mother, he's secure." <span class="Italic">Tvad-upekṣitānām:</span> "If You neglect, that 'This child must cry; this child must die,' then even by the greatest care of the father and mother, he will die." So what is the use, saying that your duty...? Duty? That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Second thing is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, first of all you understand this. Then bring second thing. That you have no duty. Your only duty is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is your only duty. But because you are under the mental platform, you are creating duties, so but that also must be finished after certain age. That is compulsory, that "You are very good, responsible man. All right, do your duty up to this. No more duty. No more duty." So this "duty, no duty," this is our creation. We are under fully control of the nature. But we have created our mental concoction: "This is duty. This is good. This is bad." That is our <span class="Italic">mano-dharma.</span> Real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And everything is <span class="Italic">mano-dharma,</span> mental creation. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> in the beginning it is said that <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra: [SB </span>1.1.2] "This false <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is rejected." These are all false <span class="Italic">dharmas.</span> Real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. But it takes time. Therefore <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga</span> is required. But actually real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and do everything... <span class="Italic">Ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> What Kṛṣṇa wants, we must know it and do it. And this is real <span class="Italic">dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How to know it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can know from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> It is open to everyone. If you cannot understand, then go to guru. He will explain to you. "And how to know it?" You cannot say. "Keep to the left" is there. You cannot say that "I did not know the law." You have deviated. Why you have gone to the right? The signboard is there, "Keep to the left." You have gone to the right; you are criminal, must be punished. So Kṛṣṇa comes personally, and He is giving instruction. How can you say, "How to know?" This is criminal. This is criminal to say that you do not know what to do; you do not see God. God has given the law. There is no question how to know. Know it! <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">. Tad viddhi.</span> Know it! Why you are neglecting? <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi. Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> That, if you do not... What is called? Ignorance of law is no excuse. You cannot say in the court, "Sir, I did not know the law." <span class="Italic">Aiye.</span> You know or not know; you have violated the law; you must be punished. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Once you know, then everyone is benefited. Your family is not neglected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The ignorance of law... Why? Why this human form of life? To know. Why you do not try to know it? Then you must be punished. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">aśraddhadhānāḥ puruṣā.</span> "If you are neglectful to know," <span class="Italic">dharmasyāsya parantapa,</span> "this <span class="Italic">dharma,</span> this science, this duty, what I am giving..." <span class="Italic">Aśraddadhānāḥ:</span> "Eh! <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is..." <span class="Italic">Aśraddadhānāḥ.</span> There is no <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> Rascals. "Then the result will be <span class="Italic">mām aprāpya.</span> He does not get Me." Then what is next? <span class="Italic">Nivartante:</span> "He goes back." Where? <span class="Italic">Mṛtyu-saṁsāra-vartmani:</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.3] "Again in the cycle of birth and death, birth and death." Again, after millions and millions of years, he'll come, again get the chance of human body, another chance to know. So this is the chance to know. You cannot expect the dog will know, the cat will know. You have got human being. You must know. The signboard, "Keep to the left," is meant for the human being. If the dog goes from right to the left, he is not to be punished, because he has no knowledge. This is common sense. But you cannot neglect. You are human being. You cannot say, "I did not see the signboard. I did not know the law. Therefore, by chance, I have violated." No. No "by chance." You must be punished. This is the responsibility of... Narottama dāsa Ṭhākura, therefore, sings, <span class="Italic">hari hari bifale, janama goṅāinu:</span> "I have wasted my time." How? <span class="Italic">Manuṣya-janama pāiyā, rādhā-kṛṣṇa nā bhajiyā:</span> "I got this human form of life. I did not know what is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa." <span class="Italic">Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu:</span> "Knowingly, I have taken poison." A human being, if he does not become Kṛṣṇa conscious, that means knowingly, he is taking poison, and he must die. <span class="Italic">Jāniyā śuniyā viṣa khāinu.</span> Sometimes I do not know what is poison. Just like child does not know. He may take. But he'll not be excused. Even a child takes poison, it does not mean the nature's law will excuse him. No. But.... What to speak of child, a human being, if he takes poison, <span class="Italic">jāniyā śuniyā,</span> then what is to be...? So in the human form of life, you cannot neglect the instruction of Bhagavān. Then you'll be punished. Severe punishment. <span class="Italic">Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān ksipāmy ajasram andhā-yoniṣu</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>

Then my becoming very big scientist, big lawyer, big this and that, everything finished. But that law is not in your hand. After death, you cannot say, "Mother nature, you are giving this body.

It is my liking." <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva-netreṇa [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> When you are criminal, you are under the grip of the magistrate.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever... The rascal says. A rascal says. It is not private. No private-public. It is laws of nature. You have to abide by that. The nature's law is "Now winter. You have to cover your body." There is no second law. So that is wanting, that we are... The present defect is that every one of us under the laws of God or nature, whatever you say. And still, we are declaring independence.
