<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...how you can reject one and accept another. It must be properly utilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like if one has got money, he cannot... He can utilize it for good purposes, and he can utilize it for bad purposes. So money is not bad. It is bad when the purpose is bad. It is good when the purpose is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> it is used for... Just like in <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> it is said that the murderer should be hanged. So this is also <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> to get him a man hanged. But <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā</span> says that this kind of <span class="Italic">hiṁsā</span> is necessary. Because the man who's committed murder, if he's hanged, then in this life all his sinful activities finished. Otherwise, in his next life he has to suffer so many things. So it is the duty of the king to take his life so that he may be relieved from other sinful reaction. So according to <span class="Italic">śāstra, hiṁsā..., ahiṁsā</span> is good, but when there is necessity, <span class="Italic">hiṁsā</span> is also good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes. When there is right <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> then it becomes a right action.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And a right action is inherently inspired with love and devotion to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And therefore it is no more <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span> But when the devilish...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And actually it is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Actually it is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> exactly, but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like father gives a slap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, it is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, the <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> so-called <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> when it is directed by Kṛṣṇa, that is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span> That is love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. But when it is not directed by Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then it is <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. Then it is <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span> And I am against that <span class="Italic">hiṁsā</span> which is not directed by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yeah, that's all right, that's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> (laughs) Yes. And especially today in the society we are all living in, nuclear age where all the power of destruction in the hands of those who are not devotees of Kṛṣṇa is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> That is <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. Therefore we are trying to make how you can, I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you have understood. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That so-called <span class="Italic">hiṁsā,</span> when it is directed by Kṛṣṇa, is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, exactly. I agree. That's, that's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The same example as I gave, gave you. That when the king condemns a murderer to death, it is not <span class="Italic">hiṁsā.</span> It is doing good to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. But only if the king is a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... King is... King means a devotee. Because the king did not remain devotee, now monarchy is abolished. King means Kṛṣṇa's representative, <span class="Italic">nara-devatā.</span> The king is supposed to act on behalf of Kṛṣṇa. Just like Kṛṣṇa's business is <span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnāṁ vināśāya ca duṣkṛtām [Bg. </span>4.8]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly, king's business is to give protection to the faithful and punish the unfaithful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But today's kings...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today's no... I'm speaking... Today's good and tomorrow is bad, that is not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm speaking the principle. The king must be representative of God. Therefore we offer so much honor to the King. Exactly like God. Why? Because King is supposed to be representative of God. Our Vedic conception is <span class="Italic">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> This <span class="Italic">catur-varṇa.</span> It is the king's duty, government's duty, to see that a person claiming to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> whether he's acting as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Nowadays that... Such supervision is not there. Therefore a man acting as <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> but he's claiming to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah, yeah, yeah. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is the king's duty. Just like the king, it is the government's duty to see that nobody cheats. If a person without any medical qualification, if he writes "Doctor, Medical practitioner," he should be punished. Similarly, if one is claiming to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must act as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> If one is claiming to be <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> he must act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Now, what are the qualifications of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> what are the qualifications of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> they are there already in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is government's duty, that you are claiming that everyone should be employed, everyone should be engaged, in his own occupation. That is called <span class="Italic">svadharmeṇa idanasya(?). Sva-dharma</span> means the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> By quality. <span class="Italic">Guṇa-karma.</span> By quality and work. So it is the duty of the government to see that a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is employed, is engaged as a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> a <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> is employed and engaged as... Just like <span class="Italic">vaiśya. Vaiśya,</span> it is said that <span class="Italic">kṛṣi-go-rakṣya-vāṇijyaṁ vaiśya-karma svabhāva-jam [Bg. </span>18.44]<span class="Italic">.</span> Now the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas,</span> they are in the share market speculating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. There are no more <span class="Italic">vaiśyas.</span> (laughs) Exactly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Industrialists. Industrialists means <span class="Italic">śūdras.</span> So if they're <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> why they should claim as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaiśyas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is government's duty. To see, "Why you are claiming <span class="Italic">vaiśya?</span> If your industry is to produce food grains, agriculture, give protection to the cows..." So in India ten thousand cows are being killed, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> are big, big (indistinct), big, big <span class="Italic">zamindars.</span> You see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Sitting quiet. (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Similarly <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Nehru. He is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but what did he do as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> But he was the head of the government. Who will speak against him? Everything is topsy turvy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. When such... When such situation arises where the king is no more representing the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> are no more following that duty...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is, this is... This world is material world. And (aside:) Why don't you come here? You can take another pad. (desires woman guest to sit comfortably)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Would you like a chair?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman guest:</span> No, it's okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> My question was that when there is no more people following their <span class="Italic">sva-dharma,</span> their true self...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That anyone can do at any moment, any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. But then what is the action for the... Practical action, practical...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical action... If you give up... If a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> gives up <span class="Italic">sva-dharma,</span> then it becomes a <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kula-dharma,</span> what is that in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> <span class="Italic">Jāti-dharma, kula-dharma.</span> So they produce <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span> If one does not follow the <span class="Italic">jāti-dharma,</span> the <span class="Italic">kula-dharma,</span> then he comes to the category of <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara. Saṅkaro narakāyaiva.</span> So when... A person born in <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family not acting as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he's <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span> So when there are number of people from the <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara</span> class, then the whole society becomes hell, <span class="Italic">narakāyaiva. Śaṅkaro narakāyaiva.</span> What is that? Read that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>

<div class="After-Verse">"With the destruction of dynasty, the eternal family tradition is vanquished, and thus the rest of the family becomes involved in irreligious practice."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is, one after another, is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So those who are responsible for giving up <span class="Italic">kula-dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">jāti-dharma,</span> and creating <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara...</span> <span class="Italic">Varṇa-saṅkara,</span> just like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya,</span> they are supposed to undergo the purificatory process <span class="Italic">daśa-vidhā-saṁskāra.</span> So the first <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span> is <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna.</span> So in this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> it is said by Nārada that as soon as <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra</span> is not taken, immediately the whole family becomes <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> So who is observing the <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna-saṁskāra?</span> Nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> (laughs) Nobody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, <span class="Italic">kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> Correct? In this age of Kali, everyone is to be accepted as <span class="Italic">śūdra</span>. No <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> no <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> All <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> or less than <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pañcavān.(?)</span> This is the position. So at the present moment, to reform that, you cannot take them to the original position. It is not possible, it is Kali-yuga. <span class="Italic">Mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ [SB </span>1.1.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are very slow, they don't accept the right path... Just like God is here, Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> But they're creating their own God. Even big, big leaders they are saying, "Eh, Kṛṣṇa, why Kṛṣṇa should be accepted?" Even big, big leaders, they do not believe that Kṛṣṇa was there on this planet, there was Kurukṣetra battle. You know better than me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if big, big scholars say, when Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī... [Bg. </span>18.65]. The scholars say, "It is not to Kṛṣṇa." You see? If now, I can frankly say, if leaders like Dr. Radhakrishnan, Gandhi and others, they mislead people, then how the people will be in normal condition? This is the position of India at the present moment. The leaders... <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> The leaders are blind. They have no training. They are not in disciplic succession. They do not know what is what, and they are taking the part of leadership, then everything is spoiled. <span class="Italic">Jāti-dharma, kula-dharma.</span> And they have created <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes. Everybody is <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore the only remedy is</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. But what...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is most scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But what you are emphasizing is <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But what I'm asking is how to bring the <span class="Italic">karma-yoga,</span> the action, to transform the society, bring back into the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the yoga in its preliminary stage is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Yoga, yoga means connecting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">karma,</span> when you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Yoga karma sukhośanām.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Akarma sukhośanām.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are addicted to <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you bring <span class="Italic">bhakti, karma-miśra-bhakti,</span> that is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> Similarly, you are addicted to speculation, <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> When you bring <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> and mix with it, then it is <span class="Italic">jñāna-miśra-bhakti</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna-yoga.</span> So, this things are there. Just like <span class="Italic">karma-yoga. Yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi, yat tapasyasi, kuruṣva tat mad-arpaṇam [Bg. 9.27].</span> This is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> You are doing something, everyone is engaged to do something, but Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi,</span> never mind, even if you are a thief. Your business is stealing-steal. <span class="Italic">Yat karoṣi</span> means that includes everything. <span class="Italic">Yat karoṣi yaj juhoṣi yad aśnāsi, yat tapasyasi, kuruṣva tat mad-arpaṇam.</span> "Give it to Me. The result, give it to Me." <span class="Italic">Karmaṇy evādhikāras te mā phaleṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Mā phaleṣu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga-</span>when you do not take the result. Ah? You may do whatever you like, but if you, if the result, if you give to Kṛṣṇa, that is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. Yeah, but <span class="Italic">karmaṇy evādhikāras te...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> This is the, the point that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you have to work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But... So... If our responsibility is to act without attachment for the result, I accept, I agree with it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa says that <span class="Italic">purottama manaḥ (?).</span> The result must be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes. But that should be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if you do not take the result, who will take it? It cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you must be giving to someone, to who is the perfect person who can take it. That is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So <span class="Italic">yat karoṣi,</span> that is the... Arjuna, he was a fighter. He was a fighter, military man. So his business was to fight. But he fought for Kṛṣṇa. Therefore it's <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga, karma-yoga,</span> whatever you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. Yes. What I'm now asking is that what you are telling us is very important, that we must act for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> But Kṛṣṇa is telling to Arjuna where to act, and how to act, and what to act, that is "Fight." And at that moment He is telling to fight the Kauravas. Now, we are confused here, that what is our fight? What is our fight?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our fight, it is not the same fight as Kurukṣetra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No, it's not same. Therefore we are in confusion, that what is our fight? Of course, we must surrender our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He wants to know how he will be engaged. Who will tell him what to do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Kṛṣṇa's representative will tell you. Kṛṣṇa is not there, but Kṛṣṇa's representative is there. So you have to ask the Kṛṣṇa's representative.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> So that's why I have come to you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> ...to ask you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you think we are representative of Kṛṣṇa, that is good. (everyone laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Perhaps you can speak for the representative of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, at least I'm directing all these boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're thinking, "And to become Kṛṣṇa's representative is very difficult thing." It is not very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> It is not difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because Kṛṣṇa... Who is Kṛṣṇa's representative? Just like Caitanya Mahāprabhu says, that</div>
<div class="Verse">āmāra ājñāya guru hañā tāra' ei deśa<br class="calibre2"/>yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa'-upadeśa<br class="calibre2"/> [Cc. Madhya 7.128]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">You understand Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says that "By My order, you become a guru." "So what shall I do, sir? What is Your <span class="Italic">ājñāya,</span> order?" That <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha 'kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">':</span> "Whomever you meet, you just speak what Kṛṣṇa has spoken." That's all. What is the difficulty? If we speak what Kṛṣṇa has spoken, exactly... Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> without my interpretation, no nonsense. No. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no more superior truth above. Truly speaking, that here is Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa. There is no more superior person or authority than Kṛṣṇa. So what is our difficulty? We are exactly repeating the statement in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are saying the same thing. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> We are asking these people, "Just surrender to Kṛṣṇa."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Don't bother with any other things." Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we are teaching them, that always think of Kṛṣṇa, always become devotee of Kṛṣṇa, always offer obeisances to Kṛṣṇa. So what is our difficulty? There is no difficulty. But if we actually do this, then I am Kṛṣṇa's representative. Who is representative? What the original master wants, if one does the same thing, he is representative. It is not difficult. But people will not do that. He'll try to avoid Kṛṣṇa and take Kṛṣṇa's book <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and interpret nonsensically and spoil the whole thing. This is going on. He's not ready to speak what Kṛṣṇa has spoken. He speaks his own words of the authority of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. If you want to speak your own word, why you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> How much, aḥ, devilish mentality. You want to speak your own philosophy-speak. Why you take advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span> But that is going on. They take advantage of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and speak their all nonsense things. They're not representative of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa's representative is he who exactly speaks what Kṛṣṇa has spoken. It is not very difficult. So everyone can become Kṛṣṇa's representative, provided he speaks exactly like Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. No, but... Can I take you back to the point which is not clear to me? When you said that <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is speaking in a context of a clear defined action for Arjuna, whereas now that clearly defined action is not available to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not available?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> 'Cause we don't know what is our action. Now, going to the...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is wrong translation. <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means occupation.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> means <span class="Italic">karma.</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> does not mean inactivity.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> activity means <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So that activity is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Ah? <span class="Italic">Yajana yājana paṭhana pāṭhana dāna pratigraha,</span> these are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣatriyas,</span> to become king, to fight for the protection of the citizens, to become charitably disposed.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> you have to act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So acting means <span class="Italic">karma.</span> How you can avoid <span class="Italic">karma?</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is also <span class="Italic">karma. Bhakti</span> is also <span class="Italic">karma. Bhakti,</span> what is this <span class="Italic">bhakti?</span> Just like we are engaged in devotional service. That service means <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So they're also rising early in the morning at four 'o clock offering <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārati,</span> and then reading books, then chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> then taking the class and taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> then going to outside for performing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> to distributing books. All day, twenty-four hours <span class="Italic">karma.</span> So therefore outsiders, they can not understand, that "They're also working like us, they're also selling books, they're going to the press, they're also eating, they're riding motorcar, they're typing, what kind of <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> it is?" They cannot understand what is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> They think <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> means, just like "Close your eyes and make some murmuring sound, that is good." <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is not like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti</span> is the quality...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, quality of <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Just like Arjuna, Arjuna was fighting. So he was giving the certificate-<span class="Italic">bhakto 'si. Bhakto 'si:</span> "You are My devotee." So everything is <span class="Italic">karma,</span> whatever you do. It is activity. But we have to see the quality of that activity. What is the quality of it. Yes, how you can live without being active? You are living being. That's not possible. Simply we have to see the quality of our activity. That makes one <span class="Italic">karma-yogī, jñāna-yogī, dhyāna-yogī, bhakti-yogī.</span> Everywhere there is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Without <span class="Italic">karma</span> there is nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. Can I ask you another...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">karma-miśra-bhakti</span>. It is not unalloyed <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unalloyed <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is very high state. But originally...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Akarma,</span> then it comes <span class="Italic">akarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">akarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, more than <span class="Italic">akarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Sannyāsa?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More than a<span class="Italic">... Sannyāsī</span> is <span class="Italic">akarma,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Sannyāsī</span> is also not <span class="Italic">akarma. Sannyāsa</span> means... That is also described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalaṁ kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>6.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is also <span class="Italic">karma. Kāryaṁ karma karoti yaḥ sa sannyāsī.</span> "It is my duty"-on this principle when one works, he is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> He does not work for himself, he works for Kṛṣṇa. And that is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī. Anāśritaḥ karma-phalam.</span> Because if you are doing something, there must be some result. But you do not take the result. <span class="Italic">Anāśritaḥ karma-phalam. Kāryam:</span> it is my duty. <span class="Italic">Kāryam. Karma karot... Karma karoti yaḥ.</span> That is <span class="Italic">karma. Sa sannyāsī.</span> So how you can say in <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> there is no <span class="Italic">karma?</span> <span class="Italic">Karma</span> is always there. But you have to see for what for this <span class="Italic">karma</span> is being done The end justify the means. What is the end of this <span class="Italic">karma?</span> So when the end is Kṛṣṇa, to satisfy Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanaṁ bhaktir uttamā</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 19.167]<span class="Italic">. </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. But what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">akarma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Akarma</span> means that does not produce another <span class="Italic">karma</span>. Or sometimes <span class="Italic">akarma</span> means laziness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No, no, (laughs), in the sense of <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmaṇo hy api boddhavyam.</span> So <span class="Italic">akarma</span> means, that is <span class="Italic">bhaktyā. Akarma</span> means, just like <span class="Italic">yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra karma-bandhanaḥ. Anyatra karma-bandhanaḥ:</span> when you become bound by the result, the action of the <span class="Italic">karma,</span> that is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And when you act <span class="Italic">yajñārthe</span>, for Viṣṇu, for Kṛṣṇa, that is not <span class="Italic">karma,</span> that is <span class="Italic">akarma.</span> It does not produce, <span class="Italic">karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said, "Those who are engaged in devotional service, they're not producing any more <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. Hm. But then why there are three words, <span class="Italic">karma, vikarma, akarma?</span> There are three.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... <span class="Italic">Vikarma</span> means..., <span class="Italic">karma</span> means you act according to the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> That is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> And <span class="Italic">vikarma</span> means when you violate the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Violate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Violate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "You should not do this." Just like in the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> it is said that you should not indulge in sinful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. That's the <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span> If you act sinfully, against the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> then it is sinful, that is <span class="Italic">vikarma.</span> And <span class="Italic">akarma</span> means which does not produce any other result. That is <span class="Italic">akarma. Karma, akarma, vikarma.</span> Yes. But generally we act, we indulge in <span class="Italic">karma</span> to get some result. And that is <span class="Italic">karma.</span> That is not <span class="Italic">vikarma. Vikarma,</span> when you act against the principles of sinful activities, no, no, when you act as sinful activity, just like <span class="Italic">striyaḥ sūnā</span> (Sanskrit). Four kinds of sinful activities are described in the <span class="Italic">śāstras:</span> illicit sex life. You can not indulge in sex life without marriage, that is illicit, that is sinful. So killing animals unnecessarily, that is sinful. Then intoxication, that is sinful. And gambling. These are sinful activities. So when you do not obey the orders of the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and engage yourself in sinful activities, that is <span class="Italic">vikarma,</span> you're becoming bound up being entangled. Therefore <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> is the safest platform, because you do not produce any more <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Whatever <span class="Italic">karma</span> you have to act, it is finished in this life. <span class="Italic">Karmāṇi nirdahati kintu ca bhakti-bhājām [Bs. </span>5.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Otherwise, beginning from ant, up to the Brahmā, everyone is bound up by the reaction of <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. <span class="Italic">Vi</span>... But is it not like <span class="Italic">vasiṣṭhaṁ jñānaṁ vijñānam.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Vasiṣṭhān karmān vikarmān?</span> <span class="Italic">"Vi-"</span> is generally used as to... a sort of <span class="Italic">bhaktyā.(?)</span> To give the quality of the <span class="Italic">karma,</span> quality of the action. Like <span class="Italic">vijñānam, jñānaṁ vijñānam. Karmān vikarmān.</span> So this a little, what is the root of the language? I don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānam</span> means you must know things theoretical knowledge and practical knowledge. That is, <span class="Italic">jñānam</span> means theoretical knowledge. And <span class="Italic">vijñānam</span> means practical knowledge. <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ vijñānam</span>. When your knowledge is applied practically in life, just like <span class="Italic">yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra.</span> This knowledge is theoretical, that one has to work only for <span class="Italic">yajña. Yajñād bhavati </span>(indistinct). This things are there. So everyone should act for<span class="Italic"> yajña. Yajñeśa</span>. In the <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">varṇāśramācāravatā puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān, viṣṇur ārādhyate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you act according to <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama, brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> never mind, whatever you are. Everything is meant for pleasing the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Viṣṇur ārādhyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam.</span> So in order to satisfy Him, there is no other way than to act according to the tenets of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> This is the beginning of civilization. Without accepting this division of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama,</span> that is animal society, everything is chaos. (some people talking aside)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> You want to ask anything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (aside:) (indistinct) ...Kṛṣṇa first, and then you know what to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we are teaching this <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> just to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Then everything is all right. And then Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi.</span> He's taking charge. Then what is the anxiety? Just surrender, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes. But what happens that some people have a social dimension, social political dimension, and have no spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But then it seems to me-I'm just asking-that we, when we are emphasizing this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we are in danger of forgetting the social political dimension. So how to bring this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are thinking wrongly that we are not responsible. Why you are thinking like that? You are thinking wrongly. Kṛṣṇa did not take in politics, part? Then why you are thinking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No, no, I'm not saying Kṛṣṇa did not take... I'm just saying that it seems that He sometimes, it seems, that people who emphasize the spiritual consciousness do not clarify enough..., it is not clear enough-and I'm not saying it's not there but it's not clear enough-the social political dimension, social action, political action, how we run our society in its practical terms. So it is not clear.</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is clear. If you are actually surrendered soul, then to you it is clear, it is very clear. Kṛṣṇa gives direction, that this is the business of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> this is the business of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So politics is the business of the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span>. So if you act according to Kṛṣṇa's direction in politics, then you are surrendered soul. It is not that because we have got this <span class="Italic">mālā</span> and <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> we are surrendered soul, and a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> cannot be surrendered soul, or a <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> cannot be surrendered soul. You have to act according to the direction. Kṛṣṇa is giving direction: "This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's karma.</span>" You do it. That means you are surrendered soul, at the same time you are acting as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> But if you act whimsically, then what is your surrender? And why did you become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa?</span> Then there is chaos. That is the present position of the society. They are not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, they do not abide by the direction of Kṛṣṇa. Still, they have become leaders. Then the whole thing is chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Chaos, yes. Yes. Now what we are, Ann and myself, we are publishing a magazine called <span class="Italic">Researchers.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Now he has become special advisor to President Kaunda in Africa. So we have taken it up to continue the magazine. Now I was talking-Mahādeva was also in it-but how we can bring this total understanding together? So when we talk people outside, how to communicate this consciousness in simple language, so that they are not at first...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are presenting...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> ...they understand the way of communication.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But we are asking all these students... When I came first in America, in 1965, I simply asked them, "You chant with me, Hare Kṛṣṇa." They did it, and gradually everything has come. So where is the difficulty? (everyone laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> (laughs) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If they chant, then they'll understand everything. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> Everything is misgiving within the heart. So if the <span class="Italic">ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam,</span> if the mirror of the heart is cleansed, then when the mirror is cleansed you can see your face correctly. Similarly when all misgivings, all dirty things is cleared from the heart, you can see things as they are, correctly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> In order to clear your heart you have to chant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> What about meditating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the best medicine, meditation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> What about the other kind?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When meditation, meditation, <span class="Italic">dhyāna,</span> it is very difficult nowadays. You chant to meditate, you think of your own business. That's another thing. So this is forced meditation: "Hare Kṛṣṇa!" Even if you do not want to hear, you will hear. (laughter) And there is chanting and dancing, everyone who doesn't wanted to hear they also hear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> What about people who believe in Jesus, God? I mean, what about Christians? It might not have the same effect on them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But Kṛṣṇa is God, and Jesus is teaching exactly what Kṛṣṇa's taught, so there is no difference to a person that has a pure heart. If we chant, all of us who have come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we've realized that Jesus Christ's teachings are fulfilled in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Jesus said that he's son of God. So we say Kṛṣṇa is God. So what is the conflict? God must have a son, one or two? So he's also the son. Where is conflict? (everyone laughs).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No conflict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> I am not sure, I think people might think there was a conflict. I mean...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Conflict is there when you disobey Christ. That's why Christ said, "Thou shalt not kill." All the Christians are simply killing. Where is a Christian? There is conflict. They'll support: this killing is this, this isn't that, this isn't that (?). They want to kill. That's all. That is conflict. If you actually follow the tenets of Christianity, there is no conflict. But if you do not follow, at the same time you say you are not Christian, there is conflict. It is clearly stated-I've asked so many Christians-that "Why do you kill?" Christ said "Thou shalt not kill." They want to support their killing process in so many ways. They'll never agree that "Yes, Christ says not to kill. We should stop it." No. They want to support it by various interpretations. That is conflict. Clear word is there, "Thou shalt not kill." And why they're maintaining so many slaughterhouses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> But it's the same with Arjuna, wasn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are talking of Christianity. Don't talk of Arjuna now. If you talk of Christianity, don't take support from Arjuna. You talk of Christianity. It is clear statement, "Thou shalt not kill." Why you are killing? "Thou shalt not covet." And illicit sex and illicit man and woman intermingling is going on. Who's stopping it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> True.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see Arjuna-you are talking of Arjuna-before fighting, before killing so many things, he getting clarified. Ah? (Sanskrit) Just see, "Why shall I kill?" So you have to understand why you should kill, why you should not kill. (aside:) Hm. Read that.</div>

No. So we are rather unhappy that in London I've seen thousands of churches practically closed. Nobody is going there. We are not happy to see. This is happening. But why people are abstaining from going to the church? Although there is Pope, and so many priests and other things. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> It has become an institution, and there is no more religious...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no life. A simple thing, that if you disobey the orders of Lord Christ, how will you become a Christian, first of all? Where is your Christianity? Simply rubber-stamping "I'm Christian" you become a Christian, without following the tenets?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Same as you were saying, Nehru was not a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but only because he was called <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Śaṅkarācārya. They all accept Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">.</span> They accept it.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the principle, they never... Just like Śaṅkarācārya and Rāmānujācārya. He's impersonalist, personalist, but both of them accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You'll find from their notes, comments on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Śaṅkarācārya, although he is impersonalist, he says <span class="Italic">nārāyaṇaḥ paraḥ avyaktāt:</span> Nārāyaṇa is beyond this cosmic manifestation; He's transcendental. That means he says He's person. Nārāyaṇa, as soon as Nārāyaṇa, the Personality of Godhead. So we have nothing to touch in the spiritual understanding. He's talking of the material understanding. His philosophy, he started the philosophy, <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he wanted to stop these material activities. <span class="Italic">Jagan mithyā.</span> Śaṅkarācārya never advocated for nationalism, for starting schools or college, hospital... Never. Why? Why should he do? If we say <span class="Italic">jagan mithyā,</span> then why should we bother all these things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is following Śaṅkarācārya? And they say that "We are followers of Śaṅkarācārya." And they are engaged. Śaṅkarācārya follower means he must become first of all <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> then talk anything else. So who is taking, going to do that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> And all those Śaṅkara Maṭha and Śaṅkarācārya's various places in India, don't live as <span class="Italic">jagat</span> was <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">jagan mithyā...</span> We don't say <span class="Italic">jagan mithyā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We Vaiṣṇavas, why should I say <span class="Italic">jagan mithyā?</span> If God is true, what is created by Him, that is also true. Because Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">bhūmir āpo 'nalo vāyuḥ khaṁ mano buddhir eva ca, bhinnā me prakṛtir aṣṭadhā [</span>Bg. 7.4]<span class="Italic">. Me,</span> "My." So why should I take Kṛṣṇa's things as false? If Kṛṣṇa is true, His things are also true. So we don't take that this material world is false. We don't say. Our philosophy is that this material world may be temporary, but because it has connection with Kṛṣṇa, it can be used for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. That is <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, bhakti-yoga. Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Just like here is a microphone in the tape recorder. Now it is material. And if we say "No, no, we are Kṛṣṇa conscious, we cannot touch this material thing." We don't say that. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Everything has connection with Kṛṣṇa, so why shall I call it as material? <span class="Italic">Parityāga.</span> This is condemned by Rūpa Gosvāmī,</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">hari-sambandha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know this art.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Now people know only "French Connection," they're forgetting Kṛṣṇa connection. (laughs) Yes, very true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we see everything has got Kṛṣṇa connection. Therefore we utilize it for Kṛṣṇa. Just like you're talking about Kṛṣṇa, it is being recorded. So it is useful for Kṛṣṇa's service. Why should I give it up? Because the airplane is there, therefore my preaching has been easier. Every year I'm wandering all over the world, twice, thrice. Because if you use airplane. So why shall I give it up? It is giving me facility to preach my Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, why shall I give it up? It is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> Just like the Jains, they do not ride on car, but if by going in a car I can go and preach, very swiftly, and come back again, why shall I give up this car? So our philosophy is not like that. <span class="Italic">Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate.</span> It is <span class="Italic">yukta-vairāgya.</span> We have no attachment for all these things. We are sitting in this palatial building, that's all right. But you can talk things under the tree. But if I sit down underneath a tree nobody will come to me.

<div class="After-Verse">Yukta-vairāgya. After all, you have to practice <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> Not under attachment. But in connection with Kṛṣṇa, nonattachment is required. Otherwise this nonattachment will not stay.

Therefore, they say it is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> but they are accepting it, under a different name-"Now let us start this school, now let us start this hospital..." They're coming to the <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> platform, under some disguise of philanthropy activities. If it is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> why you are starting a school?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes. Only way is to <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is not <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> business. For starting school the government is there, public is there. Why you... That means <span class="Italic">brahma satyam</span> you could not understand; you are coming to the school-starting. He could not perceive that <span class="Italic">brahma satyam.</span> Although he tried to do it, but he could not understand. Therefore now he has to maintain himself, eh? So, people will not give him alms, so he must show that, "I'm starting this school, I'm starting this hospital, I'm doing this, give me some <span class="Italic">candana."</span> "Give me some subscription," and taking subscription and become fat, that's all. This is going on. If <span class="Italic">brahma..., jagat</span> is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> why you are coming again to this <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> platform?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yes, yes. So detachment is there.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhukti.</span> And <span class="Italic">mukti</span> means "I shall become one with the Supreme." So these two things are described as <span class="Italic">piśācī.</span></div>

<div class="Normal-Level">So a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is already <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20].</span> So he hasn't got to ask for <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> He's already <span class="Italic">mukta.</span> Just like Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura says,</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...New Gayā, and this is the New Gokula. You are in touch in politics, therefore I'm talking something of politics, that the politicians of India, they wanted the..., from the British government, India, a strong united nation. But they could not achieve that goal. Pakistan was taken away. They're now lamenting, or there is some, always unsettled anxiety due to Pakistan. So... So far this movement is concerned, we are spreading the Indian culture, Kṛṣṇa consciousness, all over the world. So the politicians are lamenting for division of India, and here is a movement that everyone will glorify India for this culture. Why do they not join? It is practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Yeah. But the trouble is that politicians are not interested in Indian culture; they're interested in power.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Like poverty, and this lack of balance between rich and poor. How these problems can be solved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, that... Gandhi wanted to solve it, but you rejected. Gandhi wanted it to... Village organization. He started that Wardha Ashram. But you have rejected. What Gandhi can do? That was good proposal-to remain satisfied in one's own place. That was Gandhi's proposal. That "Don't go to the city, town, for so-called better advantage of life. Remain in your own home, produce your food, and be satisfied there." That was Gandhi's policy. The economic problem he wanted to solve by keeping cows, by agriculture, by spinning thread. "You want food, shelter and cloth? Produce here, and remain here. Don't be allured by the capitalists and go to cities and engage in industries." But Jawaharlal Nehru wanted, overnight, to Americanize the whole India. That is the folly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Reporter:</span> Hm. Hm. I agree.</div>
