<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see by every one of us in this temple, like that. There will be, as the <i class="calibre3">gopīs</i> said, that "Since You are here, the opulences, all opulences are there.'' Since You are in the temple, since Kṛṣṇa is present there, all opulences will be. Just see that in the temple since Kṛṣṇa is present there, all opulences is there. If you think that this is idol worship, that is another thing. Kṛṣṇa is present here. You should believe like the <i class="calibre3">gopīs</i>, then everything (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (reading <i class="calibre3">Kṛṣṇa</i>, <i class="calibre3">The Supreme Personality of Godhead</i>, chapter "Songs By the Gopīs") "Although the lotus flowers are so beautiful, without Your glance they fade away. Similarly, without You we are also dying. Actually we are neither..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This building, it was a Christian church. Nobody was there. It was a barren desert. And since Kṛṣṇa has come here, you see? Same business. Is it not the fact? Same religion, the same. It was a church, but because there was no Kṛṣṇa, it was a barren land. This is a fact. Nobody was coming there; therefore they sold it off: "It is useless.'' That's a fact. Similarly, everyone can bring Kṛṣṇa at his home by becoming a devotee. There will be opulence. There is no question of committing suicide out of frustration. So many men, so many actors, out of frustration, committing suicide. They want to die. But if they take Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa consciousness, immediately everything will be there. Not that Kṛṣṇa was present there and not present here. He is present here. The Deity is present here. And if you think otherwise, then Kṛṣṇa will be (indistinct). If you think that Kṛṣṇa is absent, then everything is lost.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (continues reading) "Actually we are neither Your wives or slaves. You never spent any money for us, yet we are simply attracted by Your glance. Now if we die without receiving Your glance, You will be responsible for our deaths. Certainly the killing of women is a great sin, and if You do not come to see us and we die, You will suffer the reactions of sin. Please come and see us. Do not think that one can be killed only by weapons. We are being killed Your absence. You should consider how You are responsible for killing women. We are always grateful to You because You have protected us many times..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the feeling of separation. Such feeling everyone should... (aside:) Go on.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "...from the poisonous water of the Yamunā, from the serpent Kāliya, from Bakāsura, from the anger of Indra and his torrents of rain, from forest fire and so many other things. You are the greatest and most powerful of all. It is wonderful that You have protected us from so many dangers. We are surprised You are neglecting us at this moment. Dear Kṛṣṇa, dear friend, we know very well that You are not actually the son of mother Yaśodā or the cowherd man Nanda Mahārāja. You are the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the Supersoul of all living entities. You have, out of Your own causeless mercy, appeared in this world, requested by Lord Brahma for the protection of the world. It is by Your kindness only that You have appeared in the dynasty of Yadu. O best of the dynasty of Yadu, if anyone afraid of this materialistic way of life takes shelter of Your lotus feet, You never deny him protection. Your movements are sweet, and You are independent, touching the goddess of fortune with one hand and in the other bearing a lotus flower. That is Your extraordinary feature. Please, therefore, come before us and bless us with the lotus flower in Your hand. Dear Kṛṣṇa, You are the killer of all the fears of the inhabitants of Vṛndāvana. You are the supremely powerful hero, and we know that You can kill the unnecessary pride of Your devotees, as well as the pride of women like us, simply by Your beautiful smile."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unnecessary pride is very bad. "Oh, I have become very advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.'' That we should never think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "We are simply Your maidservants and slaves. Please, therefore, accept us by showing us Your lotuslike beautiful face. Dear Kṛṣṇa, actually we have become very lusty, having been touched by Your lotus feet. Your lotus feet certainly kill all kinds of sinful activities of devotees who have taken shelter there. You are so kind that even the ordinary animals take shelter under Your lotus feet. Your lotus feet are also the residence of the goddess of fortune, yet You dance on the head of the Kāliya serpent with them. Now we are requesting You to kindly place Your lotus feet on our breasts and pacify our lusty desires to touch You. O Lord, Your attractive eyes, like the lotus, are so nice and pleasing. Your sweet words are so fascinating that they please even the greatest scholars, who also become attracted to You. We are also attracted by Your speaking and by the beauty of Your face and eyes. Please, therefore, satisfy us by Your nectarean kisses. Dear Lord, words spoken by You or words describing Your activities are full of nectar, and simply by speaking or hearing Your words one can be saved from the blazing fire of material existence. Great demigods like Lord Brahma and Lord Siva are always engaged in chanting the glories of Your words. (devotees continue reading for several pages) Great yogis like Lord Siva, Lord Brahma or even Lord Śeṣa and others always try to fix their attention upon Kṛṣṇa in their heart, but here the <i class="calibre3">gopīs</i> actually saw Kṛṣṇa seated before them on their cloths."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is yoga. This is yoga system, to see Kṛṣṇa within your heart. That is real.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> (continues reading until end of chapter) (end)</div>
