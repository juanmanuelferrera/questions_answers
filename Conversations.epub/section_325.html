<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...last hundred and fifty years, one of the major problems of western theologians has been the relationship between reason and faith. They've been seeking to understand faith through reason but they have not been able to come to any terms of the relationship between their reasoning abilities and faith. So there's been like a leap, almost a rejection of any kind of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just like we are walking on this street, so there is relation. This path is made for my walking. This is the relation with this road and myself. This is not made for... For animals also. But at least, we can take it is made for man. So for walking of man this road is made. So this is my relation. So in this way, everything you search out, you'll find out some relation. Is it not? Try to understand this first. Everything you take... Just like here is a microphone. There is my relation: I talk and it is recorded. So where is the difficulty to find out relationship with everything. Is there any difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They see one, Śrīla Prabhupāda. The theologians perceive when they see that reason and faith are in two realms...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is reason, that everything we are using, there is a relationship. How can you deny it? If I have got relationship with everything, then I have got some relationship with God also. Try to understand this fact. Hmm? Have you got relationship with God or not? If we have got relationship with everything of God's creation, then why not with God? Answer, any one of you. Why you are silent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Because you're right, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Hare Kṛṣṇa. We must have some relationship with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Their point is that they can only have faith in God. Their reason tells them there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of faith, it must be. Faith may be false. There must be. Because we have got relationship with everything, therefore ultimately everything is created by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> That requires faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not faith; it is fact. Faith may be wrong. Faith may be right or wrong, but fact is fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, when they say fact, they mean what they can perceive through their senses grossly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, with senses, senses. That is... Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement means that we have got relationship with God and senses, our senses. That is <span class="Italic">hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> When the senses are engaged with the Supreme, in relationship, that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It is a question of senses. It is not vague. We apply everything, we go with our senses. Just like the leg, we go, take our legs to the temple. We use our tongue for glorifying, for eating the <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Every senses. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> It is not sensuous, but engaging the senses in the service of the proprietor of the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> But they say that's a faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's not faith, that's fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say when we offer <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> it's just a faith that a God accepts it because you cannot see God eating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, you cannot see, I see. I am not a fool like you. (laughter) I can see; therefore I offer. But you cannot see. So I have to open your eyes. You come to me. That is our propaganda. You are blind. You are suffering with cataract. I shall operate and you'll see also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't see, that does not mean I don't see. Why do you accept like that? You may be fool rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They want their team of scientists to see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Scientist means another rascal. Big rascal. You are a rascal, and your bigger scientist, he's a big rascal. He's a big rascal. <span class="Italic">Saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> You know this verse? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> People who are like hogs, dogs, camels and asses glorify nondevotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the, anyone nondevotee, he's a big camel, or big dog or big swine, like that. So these people who are praising them, they are also cats and dogs and swines, and the leader is also big swine. That's all. That is the difference. The so-called scientist, philosopher, is a big animal. That's all. But he is animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say we're just dreamers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dreamer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Dreamers. That we make up fantasies about God and heaven, but actually,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why fancies? You have no brain to understand; therefore you say, "fancy"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, their common ground of objectivity is what they can perceive with the senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you can sense with the senses. You perceive with the senses the sand, but who has made the sand? You have not made. Why you are so fool that you don't understand this? This sand... Here is a perception, direct perception. This water, vast water-direct perception. Who has made it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they say, "If it was made by God, we'd be able to see him just like the sand."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but you have to get the eyes. That I say. Because you are blind, you have cataract, I have to operate. You'll see. You'll see. You come to treatment. Therefore the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "Go to guru and be treated and try to understand." But how you can see with your blind eyes, cataract eyes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, that vision, that seeing, is supramundane. They only consider the mundane vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, supramundane, everything is supramundane. Because... How do you know that there is nothing in the sky? Now you say it is vacant. So your eyes is deficient. It is not vacant. There are innumerable planets, but you cannot see. You cannot see. You are blind. Therefore, because it is not in your power to see, you have to hear from me. "Yes, there are millions of stars there." You have to accept it. You cannot see. But because you cannot see does not mean that it is vacant. It is deficiency of your senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they will admit that, but they say, "Still, we cannot... Even though we are ignorant of some things, we still can't accept what we can't see."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If you are ignorant, you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Because what we're told may be wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> May be wrong, that is your misfortune. But the process is that where your senses cannot approach, you have to hear from authority. That is the process. But if you don't approach authority, if you approach a cheater, that is your misfortune. But the process is, where your senses cannot act, you have to approach authority. That is the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they want experimental knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is experimental.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say, "It cannot be proved."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not proved? Just like I gave you the... this water, this sand, it is practical. Now you must know somebody has made it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, the difficulty is, in a group of atheists, you can't prove God no matter what you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, atheists, kick them on their face. Atheists, they are... Those who are reasonable, that everything see, that somebody has made. So this sand is also made by somebody, the water is also made by somebody, the sky is also made by somebody. Now you find out who is that somebody. That is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> They do not want to transcend the limits. They do not want to transcend the limits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question of transcending, practical. Everything you see, it is made by somebody. The stick is made by somebody. The cloth is made by somebody. So this must be made by somebody.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> But they would say, "Present me the somebody so that I..." They would say, "Present to me the somebody so that I can see him."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I'll present you. So you have to take training from me. You have to make your eyes to see Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> We want to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the... Yes. But if you refuse to be treated, if you don't go to the physician, then how you'll be? You are blind now. There is cataract. Now you have to treat in a surgical operation. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is the injunction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> You see, that step requires faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not faith, practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Initially it must be, there must be faith in the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Practical. If you want to learn something, you must to go the expert. That is not faith; it is a fact. You cannot learn anything by yourself. That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> If someone is actually sincere, can he be cheated or will he always get a bona fide guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if he is sincere he'll get. Yes. <span class="Italic">Guru-kṛṣṇa-kṛpāya pāya bhakti-latā-bīja</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 19.151]<span class="Italic">.</span> Guru and Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is within you. As soon as He sees that you are sincere, He'll give you the right person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> So if you are not completely sincere, you might get a Guru Maharaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> If you're not completely sincere, you might get someone else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because you want to be cheated, you go to the cheater. That's all. <span class="Italic">Ye yathā māṁ prapadyante tāṁs tathaiva bhajāmy aham [Bg. </span>4.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is intelligent, superintelligent. If you are a cheater, He'll cheat you. He'll cheat you. First-class cheat, Kṛṣṇa. But if you're actually sincere, then He'll give you the right thing. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhag..., mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> [Bg. 15.15] "Everything is coming from Me: <span class="Italic">smṛtiḥ,</span> remembrance, and forgetfulness." If you are a cheater, Kṛṣṇa will give you such intelligence, you'll forget Kṛṣṇa forever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, so it is so, "Birds of a feather flock together." The cheaters flock together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "Birds of the same feather flock together."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The thing is that our philosophy is as supportable as theirs, but because they are in control they have the dominance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who has dominance?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atheists? (laughs) One kick of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> he's finished. (laughter) All dominance. One this kick his dominance all finished, in one second. (laughter) No dominance. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> They are under control, but thinking that "We are free." That is called <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> that is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> They are under full control but they are thinking, "We are free." That is <span class="Italic">māyā. Mohinī, mohinīṁ śritāḥ.</span> What is that verse? <span class="Italic">Āsurīṁ mohinīm?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Rākṣasīm. Moghāśā mogha,</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṛtiṁ mohinīm. Moghāśā mogha-karmāṇo mogha-jñānā vicetasaḥ [Bg. </span>9.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they are bewildered, all their hopes will be frustrated. <span class="Italic">Moghāśāḥ.</span> Because they are rascals, <span class="Italic">āsurīm,</span> atheists, all their hopes will be frustrated. This is stated. And that is being done. They are making so big, big plan; now it is going to be frustrated. Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Still, they don't want to come to their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. Rascal means that however kick him on his face, still, he'll insist. That is rascal. Rascal means that. They'll never take good lesson. That is rascal. And sensible means he takes good lesson. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> And why they remain rascal? Because they are <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ,</span> very, very sinful. Very, very sinful. Don't you see? They are maintaining slaughterhouse. They are maintaining brothel. They are ruining everyone's life by sense gratification. These are all sinful activities. Therefore they remain rascal forever. They cannot improve. Because they are so sinful, they have to suffer, go to the darkest region. They'll have to become worms of the stool. That is awaiting them. But they do not know how things are going on. They are thinking, "We are now safe. We are safe." That is foolishness. That is rascaldom. So you are now feeling all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Rascal means that... You know the story, that Kālidāsa, a great poet, he was a great rascal. So... It is a long story. So he was sitting on the branch of a tree and cutting. So some gentleman: "Why you are cutting? You'll fall down." "No, no, I'll not fall down." But when he fell down, then he went to that gentleman, "How did you know, sir, that I shall fall down?" Then they concluded, "Here is a rascal number one." (laughter) "Here is a rascal number one." They do not know that they are going to hell. That is rascaldom. By their so-called scientific advancement, philosophy, education, they are going to hell. That they do not know. Therefore they are rascals. Therefore they are rascals. This is the definition of rascaldom: one who does not know where he is going. If somebody goes in this way straight, and you say "Don't go!" "No! Why shall I not go?" He's rascal. (laughter) He's rascal. And the another rascal, "Yes, yes, you can go, it is all right." <span class="Italic">Yata mata tata patha.</span> "As many ways you manufacture, it is all right. You can go this way." He's another rascal. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> How do we bring them to their senses?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Be Kṛṣṇa conscious and everything will be solved. How we are speaking? Because we have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante māyām etāṁ taranti,</span> as soon as you surrender to Kṛṣṇa, all this <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> misconception, will go. You'll become right person, in knowledge. That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, to become perfect man. Because there is guidance, the perfect guidance, so he becomes perfect. <span class="Italic">Harer nāma harer nāma harer nāma...</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21]. [break] This is the statement in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata. Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram: [SB </span>7.5.30] "Because they cannot control their senses, therefore they are making progress towards the darkest region of hell." <span class="Italic">Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita:</span> "And repeatedly chewing the chewed." They make one plan. It is frustrated. Again make another plan. That is frustrated. Again make another plan. But they will never agree to accept that these plans are all useless. That is rascaldom. That is rascaldom. Repeatedly chewing the chewed, chewing the chewed. The same woman, same vagina, and that is their pleasure. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> At home, and in street or nightclub and theater-the same vagina. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they would say that that is braveness. they are brave in trying again and again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they must say. That is their rascaldom. One who goes, braveness, go to the Pacific Ocean and die, and go to hell. That is their braveness. That is their braveness. They are bravely going to hell. That's all. There is a story, <span class="Italic">palavarne boi nate</span>(?). One man is chasing another man. So the man who is chased, he's asked, "Why you are fleeing away, fleeing away?" So, "Am I afraid of you? Why shall I not flee? Why shall not go? Am I afraid of you." He's fleeing out of fear, but still, he says, "Am I afraid of you? Am I afraid of you? Why shall I not? Why shall I stop?" This is the position. "Bravely I am going to hell. Why shall I stop? I am brave." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It's crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, crazy. This is stated:</div>
<div class="Verse">piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya<br class="calibre2"/>māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Just like when a man becomes crazy, ghostly haunted, he speaks all nonsense, similarly, anyone who is under the influence of this material energy, he's crazy." He's crazy, talks all nonsense. That's all. [break]</div>
<div class="Verse">māyār bośe jāccho bhese'<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic">Khāccho hābuḍubu bhāi</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura's... "Why you are being carried away by the waves of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and you are becoming drowned and sometimes up, sometimes down? Why you are wasting your life in that way?"</div>
<div class="Verse">jīva kṛṣṇa dās e biśwās<br class="calibre2"/>korle to' ār duḥkho nāi</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"If you simply accept Kṛṣṇa as your guidance, there is no more <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>" But they'll not accept. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore one who accepts and surrenders unto Kṛṣṇa after many, many births of such struggle for existence, he is actually wise. He's actually wise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, why has it taken so long for a pure devotee to come to the West? Has the West been so sinful that no pure devotee has come before Your Divine Grace?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) Don't be sorry. At that time you were so sinful that you could not receive a pure devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Once in a lecture a lady asked you why hadn't you come sooner, and you just said, "Well, you weren't ready for me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, "Because you were not ready." (laughs) Yes, I told, yes. Now the Western boys, the descendants of the Western people, they are fortunate; therefore they receive Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kona bhāgyavān jīva.</span> It is Kṛṣṇa's desire that "These people are suffering so much; let some devotees come here." So you are all devotees. You have come to join together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, during the progress of evolutionary process, suppose if the individual soul falls down from the human platform, the individual soul falls down from the human platform to some other lower species, but in the course of again evolutionary process, at some stage along the path he'll come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Is this...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, that is the process. Evolution means to come to that end, Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is real evolution. If one misses the chance, then again falls down. But the natural progress is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But ultimately he will come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, ultimately everyone will come to Kṛṣṇa. Not Kṛṣṇa consciousness, but Kṛṣṇa. At the end of this world, devastation, they enter into the body of Kṛṣṇa. They remain there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That wouldn't be very good for a devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? But they have no sense. These birds are feedies(?) or their bodily extension is so much. I think they're feedies(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They're what.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> What? Very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how they are experienced. They're not afraid of the ocean, although they are very small. They know how to save him. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</span> [Bg. 15.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is there within the heart. They are giving, "Now get off." They immediately get off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Boy. That's Viṣṇu within their heart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] ...nice, very broad and clean. [break] ...can overflood the whole area, but no. "Up to this, no more, sir." Under whose order they are working? There must be some control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They would say it's under the control of the moon. The moon controls the tides.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the moon is controlled by whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They'll say, "By nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nature is controlled by whom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> Who is controlling the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is answered in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram: [Bg. 9.10]</span> "Nature is controlled by Me." Therefore He is absolute controller. But He is not controlled by anyone. Therefore He is absolute controller. Just like a, what is called? Magnetic stone?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Magnet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Magnet, it attracts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Iron filings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Iron filings. But who has given this power to this magnetic stone? You cannot give.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say, "It's just there by nature's arrangement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is answered: "Nature is controlled by God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, they prefer to leave nature as nondescript. When they say or designate as "nature," they prefer to leave that nondescript, nonspecific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? That means insufficient knowledge. They do not wish to describe it because your foolishness will be discovered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They will say that "I can do that. That is done by nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the case of a magnet, suppose if I take a piece of iron and if I magnetize it by electrical current, it will act as a magnet. So they say...,</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but the iron is not manufactured by you. Neither the magnetic stone is manufactured by you. You take nature's product and utilize it. That is not your original creation. So what is credit to you? You can transform. That is in your hand. <span class="Italic">Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat</span> [Bg. 7.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are two things: material and spiritual, inferior energy and superior energy. <span class="Italic">Jīva-bhūtāṁ mahā-bāho.</span> The living entities, they are superior energy. Why superior? They can take the materials and handle. <span class="Italic">Yayedaṁ dhāryate jagat.</span> That is your superior energy. You can take the matters and combine it and make something else. That is the world, going on, matter and spirit. You have created your own body by your desire. So that you can do, but the materials, the body, you cannot create. That is not in your power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They are trying to make it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again "trying." It is already there. What is the use of your trying? The same thing. Already dog is barking, but one is trying to imitate. That's all. But people will go to see the imitation barking by purchasing ticket, and the real barking they'll neglect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> That is called, "new discovery."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that new discovery? Barking is already there. What is new discovery? You are simply imitating barking, that's all. Barking is already there. What is discovery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But that imitation is just new.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Imitation is flattery. That's all. Imitation is the best way of flattery. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Actually they are proving our point because as persons they can imitate the Supreme person, but He made the original. If they were not persons or living entities, they couldn't imitate God's creation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, in your laboratory, by mixing hydrogen, oxygen, if you produce one ounce of water, what is your credit? Here is vast water already.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say it was not done before in the lab.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is done already; otherwise where the water came? You do not know who did it. That is your ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So it just enviousness. They're just envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foolishness. Enviousness means one must be able. But they are not able. Simply foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> They have created artificial gems, like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like you are a powerful man. I am a powerful man. I become envious. That is allowed. But I'm not powerful, I'm trying to imitate you, it is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they're saying that God didn't give me all the knowledge to do, how to make this water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because He wanted you to remain a fool. He wanted. Because you are atheist, He wanted that you shall remain ever fool. That is God's business. <span class="Italic">Tān ahaṁ dviṣataḥ krūrān kṣipāmy ajasram aśubhān yoniṣu</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> These atheistic class, they remain always fools. Kṛṣṇa gives him birth in such a family, in such a country, in such a posi..., that he remains fools. He remains always fool. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> Prabhupāda, it's like the barber giving opinion on the science of medicine. It's like barber giving opinion on the science of medicine. Because the materialistic person, they claim to be expert of material science, and still, they want to give opinion on the spiritual science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they are not even expert of material science. They are expert in bluffing others things with jugglery of words. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, they're saying that it was not done before, like telephones and these airplanes and these new discoveries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, there were better telephones. You do not know it. Just like Sañjaya is sitting with his master, Dhṛtarāṣṭra, and he's relaying all the war affairs going on. He asked, <span class="Italic">kim akurvata sañjaya: [Bg. 1.1]</span> "What did they do?" But he was sitting in the room. Where is your that telephone? It is television within the heart. He is seeing everything and relay. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> don't you see? <span class="Italic">Sañjaya uvāca, dhṛtarāṣṭra uvāca.</span> Dhṛtarāṣṭra inquired, "Now, after meeting my sons and nephews, what they are doing?" And he's relaying, "Now Duryodhana is going to see Droṇācārya. Droṇācārya says like this. Bhīṣmadeva says..." How does he say within the room? But you know that science?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they will say that that was only possible...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He will say... They may say, but we are putting some fact. They may say all nonsense. We are not going to accept that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Some of them say, "Well we've improved on nature. By making things like plastics and medicines, we've improved nature."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Very improvement. People were eating in silver plates, golden plates, and you have improved by plastic plates. (laughter) This rascaldom can be understood by another rascal. We are not going to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The plastic is a great problem because they can't get rid of it. Plastic has become a great problem because there is no way to dispose of it. So it just piles up and piles up, and they can't get rid of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> In the future they are going to make plastic houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Transparent, you can see everything from the house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the credit there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say that is an improvement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali Mardana:</span> But the plastic depends on oil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is their foolishness. They are going to hell and still they are thinking, "improvement." This is their foolishness. Foolish means that, that he's going to hell, but he's thinking, "improving." This is their...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, wouldn't it be more sincere if these people, these scientists said, "We don't want to be taken out of this dream, that with our senses and with all the machines built on senses we will be able to make it"? But they don't want to be taken out of that dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is their foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> They don't want to admit it even.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? They have to admit Just like I gave you the example that you cannot see how many stars are there, but there are. If you say, "I don't see it, I don't believe it," that is your foolishness. That is your foolishness. You have to admit that your senses are limited. They are not perfect. That is the four defects of the conditioned soul: he commits mistake, he is illusioned, he cheats, and his senses are imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> But they say they try and try again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, try, how? How can you? You are diseased person. Suppose you are suffering from cataract disease. So you can try, try, try, try. Will you be cured? You'll never be cured. You must go to a physician. He'll operate, surgical operation. Then there is chance of seeing. You cannot, trying, trying, trying, trying. Then you go on trying, but you'll never be cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> But that is just what they do not want to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is foolishness. That is foolishness. They do not take good advice. That is foolishness. Foolishness means <span class="Italic">mūrkhāyopadeśo hi prakipaya na śāntaye</span> (?).<span class="Italic"> Mūrkha,</span> a rascal, if you give him good advice, he'll be angry. Just like a serpent, if you bring the serpent and if you tell the serpent, "My dear friend serpent, you live with me. I shall give you daily nice food, milk and banana. You'll be very pleased." So the result will be that his poison will increase. One day he'll say, "Phaḥ! Phaḥ!" (laughter) So these rascals are like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they won't give up hopes. They are always hopeful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is foolishness. Their hopes are being frustrated every moment; still, they are hoping. That is foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I once was distributing some of your literature to a library, and the librarian said, "If these are five thousand years old, where is the proof of this? Do we have the copies that were written down five thousand years ago?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the proof. This is the proof. You see. But if you close your eyes... Just like if somebody says, "Now there is sunrise, light." And if he is in darkness, he says, "Where is the proof there is light?" So, "You please come out and see." So you read it and there will be proof.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Even if you don't accept it's five thousand years old, that doesn't diminish the value of the books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply read it. There is no question of five thousand, ten thousand, old or new. Just see what is the knowledge there. <span class="Italic">Lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām [SB </span>1.7.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they are fools, for them this literature is made. <span class="Italic">Lokasyājānato vidvāṁś cakre sātvata-saṁhitām.</span> [break] ...accept <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> then their Darwin's theory is finished.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The theologians are saying that if we say man is simply soul, he is not his body, we are not accepting the whole man. The whole man means soul and body together.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Body, mind and soul.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Wolfe:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they are foolish enough to try it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they are going to make houses on the moon now. On the surface of the moon they'll make houses in a few years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the benefit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There's plenty of space on the earth. Why do they have to go to the moon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Because it was not done before, so they want to show it to the people. They want to show the power of science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Power of science means imitating the barking of the dog. That's all. Dog is already barking, but they imitate and they become scientists. That's all. This is their power. How to imitate. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they will say, "We are more advanced." So they can imitate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all right. But we are not so fools that we shall waste our time for imitation. We have got already real thing. Why shall I go to the imitation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Their imitations are cheap. Like a sputnik, how does it compare with a planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not cheap! Their imitation... They are going to the... They're spending millions and millions. It is very dear, costly. First thing is imitation, and that imitation is very, very costly. Very expensive. So that is their foolishness. They'll be satisfied with the imitation which is very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They work so hard. Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is a nice incident. There is a scientist from France, Pasteur. When he was about to be married, the same day, he forgot his own marriage day because he was working in his laboratory, doing experiments. So one of his friends reminded him, "Oh, Pasteur, your marriage day is today so you come out from the lab and you have to go there." Then he went out and got married,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a Bengali proverb, <span class="Italic">yāṅra loke bie naya, para lokera ghumnaya:</span> (?) "The man who is to be married, he has forgotten, and the neighbors, they are not sleeping, 'Oh, that man will be married. That man will be married.' " But he has forgotten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> So people are saying that "See how sincerely he's working. Take his example."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So who is not sincerely working? He's working for some money. That's all. So everyone is working for money. What is the difference? If he's not paid for that, he'll not work. Just like a dog is working for the master, for the bread. That's all. So he's working not for himself, not for others, but for his money. Or some ambition. Prestige. That's right. [break] ...where? On the beach you are seeing?</div>
