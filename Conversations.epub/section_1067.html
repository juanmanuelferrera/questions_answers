<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So this is a... In the battle between the demigods and the demons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The verse was</div>
<div class="Verse">teṣāṁ padāghāta-rathāṇga-cūrṇitād<br class="calibre2"/>āyodhanād ulbaṇa utthitas tadā<br class="calibre2"/>reṇur diśaḥ khaṁ dyumaṇiṁ ca chādayan<br class="calibre2"/>nyavartatāsṛk-śrutibhiḥ pariplutāt</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Translation: Because of the impact on the ground of the legs of the demons and demigods and the wheels of the chariots, particles of dust flew violently into the sky and made a dust cloud that covered all directions of outer space, as far as the sun. But when the particles of dust were followed by drops of blood being sprinkled all over space, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Purport: The cloud of dust covered the entire horizon, but when drops of blood sprayed up as far as the sun, the dust cloud could no longer float in the sky. A point to be observed here is that although the blood is stated to have reached the sun, it is not said to have reached the moon. Apparently, therefore, as stated elsewhere in Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, the sun, not the moon, is the planet nearest the earth. We have already discussed this point in many places. The sun is first, then the moon, then Mars, Jupiter and so on. The sun is supposed to be 93,000,000 miles above the surface of the earth, and from the Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam we understand that the moon is 1,600,000 miles above the sun. Therefore the distance between the earth and the moon would be about 95,000,000 miles. So if a space capsule were traveling at the speed of 18,000 miles per hour, how could it reach the moon in four days? At that speed, going to the moon would take at least seven months. That a space capsule on a moon excursion has reached the moon in four days is therefore impossible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) So my reason is alright?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Modern scientists (Hindi-about challenge)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever Mars going? Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes. They don't put anything about it now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi conversation)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Grapes are sour. Full of sand. (Hindi conversation) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...thirty-six thousand students so it's in a very, very nice area, just for the type of people we'd like to reach, you know, intelligent. And also it's a... Actually what it is, it's a motel that's had its, you know, it has no business there. It's surrounded by other more expensive...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So there is one building within the land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, it's like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> OK, this here's a diagram here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This is the street right here and you enter here and there's buildings here, you know, for a restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Right here. We're going to make a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is already there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. We're going to make an extension of Govinda's Restaurant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And here you have the offices where you can make an apartment and here we have thirty units, small, about the same size as the rooms upstairs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Which is good for like <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's not luxurious, it's just small rooms. In here we have a small swimming pool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's not too big. And all these are fully grown trees with, there's some palm trees here. Then in the back...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) for the trees are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, did you see the tree? OK. In the back here, this is, we have fruit trees, different types of fruit trees like a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, very, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Pomegranate, you know and some peaches and plums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pomegranate is a very nice fruit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. And this area right here is more or less empty and available for... These are small bushes here, these are small bushes. So we are proposing to construct a temple right about in here, then use the rest of the land for farming and growing flowers for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You are destroying these trees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, see these trees, they're not real tall all the way, there's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, this is green also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, this is greenery around here and occasionally there's a big tree and then along the back here's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big trees are this side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, exactly, and also in here around this area and around in here. And in the back here we have like a small desert garden with cactus and different things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is desert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, it's not a desert but that's the way this rear portion has been landscaped, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's made to look like a desert but it's actually very lush and it looks a lot bigger than two acres.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...these things are (indistinct), you can keep cows. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm not sure if we can keep cows in there because it's inside of the city and sometimes they don't allow the cow within a certain zoning. And now the only problem we might run into with this is that it's not zoned right now for a church or a temple but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't say "temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Excuse me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say "community project."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Community project?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Community project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh, community project. Well...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't say church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> OK. But the thing is if... The first thing that it can be rezoned for is a church and a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no need of rezoning because we are Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa community. So wherever we live we worship Kṛṣṇa. It is not a public show, it is our own private worshiping Deity. I can keep Deity in my home. Just like Christian Deity, Mary, Jesus Christ, in the room. There is no objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I don't think there's any objection to that but according to Guṇagrahi (indistinct-mic noise) ...problem, San Diego, like the government there doesn't approve too much of them and each time they try to buy a nice piece of land, you know, somehow...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's why I say, "Don't call it temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Don't call it temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, community project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Community project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Project. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> OK. I can tell them that. But he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are just establishing a community project. But because we are Hare Kṛṣṇa people so wherever we live we worship Kṛṣṇa, that's all. Don't say temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Don't say temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> A problem may come if they say, "But you invite people to come."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Friends I must invite. For feast. This is our community project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Once you're in there, then it's... In Melbourne we told them that it's just strictly private, it was going to be like a monastery, there was just going to be a few monks who were going to do our worship, like that. And then when we were in we just had the Sunday feast and everything and everything was fine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well actually, the way...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śaṭhe śāthyaṁ samācaret.</span> That is that if the other is cheat, you become cheat. Why you should be honest? <span class="Italic">Śaṭhe śāthyaṁ samācaret.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well, in this case actually I don't think there will even be a problem if we said "temple." Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your... I say, "Don't declare it a temple." It is our community, living quarters, residence, that's all. We live like this, our style of living is this. How you can...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Just like the usual was doing something at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Don't say it is temple. That's all. (chuckles) Kill law by law. (indistinct) ...and safest position is that you don't say it is a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Well actually we're not coming on to them like we are, you know, Hare Kṛṣṇas or anything like that. We are going in <span class="Italic">karmi</span> clothes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, there are many communities, <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> in our Hare Kṛṣṇa movement. We don't say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> According to the escrow we say that we want to build like some sort of a church and the zoning laws for that particular area... Now if you want to rezone, the only thing that's allowed to rezone for is for churches and temples, they have it written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take help from Detroit. He knows very well. That was rezoned. You did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He knows everything. That was a residential quarter. Now we have made it a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the process?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Well we had, because we were dealing with a Ford, the grandson of Henry Ford, because he was wealthy, he had a lawyer friend who had a connection in the zoning board so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Influence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what was the law point? You cannot influence by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, we... The point was that that particular property was secluded. By making it a multi-residential dwelling with a public worship facility there was no inconvenience to the neighbors. That was the main thing. We went around to all the neighbors in the neighborhood. We got them to sign a petition saying they had no objection to our holding meetings there and having multi-residential and that was our strongest, besides our connection with this lawyer, having the neighborhood support was our strongest weapon. And the neighbors all were very warm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The black people, they are simple. They are not so (indistinct). If they are satisfied...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> We gave them <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and a little chanting and they were satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Actually the neighbors around here, all along here are businesses on either side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then they'll suffer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Then there's no... Actually even if we ask for rezoning, they cannot refuse us because according to their laws the only thing that this particular land can be rezoned for, number one on the list is churches and temples. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you do it, but if there is doubt you can say, "No temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Right, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct-talking together) ...take the name of a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This is a minor problem in this case. It used to be a major but it's minor now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Community project. That's all. We are Hare Kṛṣṇa community, it is our project. We live together, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Well I'll pass that along to Guṇagrahi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I went to San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, about two years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a big park, San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Balboa Park. You had one lecture there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. So how far it is from the park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> About ten or fifteen miles. You see it is more in, away from the ocean and it's located right in the middle of this college community where most of the residents are students of the university and the university has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can get the chance of attracting students.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Oh yes, yes of course, this is a main thing there of the location is in being around the student community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> San Diego seaside, I went. There are so many swimming clubs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In La Jolla.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The underneath, under within water they're swimming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Skin-diving, underneath the water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> San Diego.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> San Diego. (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It's in California. San Diego, California.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> See, at the present moment the San Diego temple, they used to have two buildings and they have been more or less evicted from the main building and they had to move the Deities to the residential quarters and they had to move all the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīnis</span> out to another building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they have left that building?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, they left that building, the main building and now the Deities are in the one over, the which used to be the residential quarters and it's just a little small room and it's very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inconvenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Very inconvenient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So start this temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So this is in escrow now, it's already started and it will take ninety days and it all depends on the rezoning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The zoning has been applied for?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, it's been applied for and the chances of them refusing us is very slim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When is their next meeting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I really couldn't say, I don't know but it will be soon. There's one boy who's working on it. I forgot what his name is. I have a bad memory for names. But anyway, I and some friends of mine would like to construct a temple right here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Right there, just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do, according to choice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And we were thinking about a design like a large dome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You know and then on each corner, kind of like, what do you call those?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Cornice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You know with a little thing. And then right in the middle of the dome, we want to put like a big gold, not real gold but you know, gold-colored thing with flags.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Flags.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Put flags on the top. Right exactly. This was our initial idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you make a temple like this? You see?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> (indistinct-talking together) ...attractive point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But then you cannot deny that it is not a temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, that's true. Actually...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Best thing is this type temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Like here. With three domes. Well see, it all depends on the cost. I have some cost estimates here that... We figured out it's somewhere between thirty and forty dollars per square foot to build.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Now if we build a temple that's 6,500 square feet, quite a large size, that would come out to $260,000 and on down to 3,600 square feet which would be about $144,000. I've collected about $100,000 on my own and I have another person who promised somewhere between fifteen and twenty-five and by the time that three or four months have... Actually we couldn't build until about six or seven months anyways so by this time...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) ...that Kṛṣṇa will (indistinct) money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Also another thing, this is... You may remember when you were in Los Angeles last time, Kṛṣṇa-kanti and Mangalananda asked you if they could do this contemporary style music with Kṛṣṇa lyrics. So this is the very first copy. Actually there's not much to see it's just like any other album. This is the first test pressing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He has a cassette which you can listen to some time if you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I can listen. Play it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> You would like to hear something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's done to like modern popular music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> With the lyrics about Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you keep one record player.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well record players are a bit bulky to carry. They have it on cassette.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this time anyone comes, ask them to bring one record player. Japanese record player is very cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, I think that's a good idea to have because all these albums are coming out now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But you can get them all on cassette...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Between fifteen dollars, sixteen dollars.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> One of her cows, Premadhana. She's given it to us. We've had it now for five or six and we have built a nice area for her. We have ten acres of land for her to roam around on. She's very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So take your country (indistinct) Kṛṣṇa conscious. Then surely we shall get the government. This is the prediction of a politician, "Kṛṣṇa conscious, the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is spreading like a epidemic. That I'm afraid within ten years they'll get the government."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Hare Kṛṣṇas. That will be main thing. At least they will criticize Hare Kṛṣṇa and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. (laughter) That's all. We want. (Sanskrit) It is said that. (Sanskrit) If we respect chanting, it is very good, even by neglecting chant, that is also good. Just like Ajamila, he chanted. He never meant "Nārāyaṇa." He meant his son, but he got result. <span class="Italic">Ante nārāyaṇa smṛtiḥ [SB </span>2.1.6]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never meant that he's calling for Nārāyaṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can prepare little <span class="Italic">daliya,</span> that's all. (Hindi) Unfortunately they do not try to understand the science of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Vidhi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vidhi ne.</span> One must know... <span class="Italic">Vidhi,</span> that practical and theoretical. So <span class="Italic">vidhi,</span> mostly theoretical and when you practice it, it is <span class="Italic">jñāna, vijñāna. Jñāna, vijñāna.</span> So <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> means theoretical knowledge and <span class="Italic">vijñāna</span> means practical application.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Is religion a practical knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religion means, that I was discussing, religion means the law given by God. That is religion. They do not know it. They do not know what is God, they do not know what is the words or order of God. Whole world is like that. They profess some religion but religion means the law of God. But if they do not know what is God, then how he'll understand the law of God? That means there is no religion. All cheating. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjita kaitavo,</span> the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> rejects all kinds of so-called religious system, accusing that they're all cheating. Cheating, all cheating. If you do not know God, what is the meaning of their religion? It is simply cheating. If you have accepted a style of religion without any understanding of God, then it is simply you have been cheated. And that is going on. Everywhere. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> I have been to all these four corners of India, Badarikāśrama, Rāmeśvaram, Jagannātha Purī and Dvārakā and he told me what they say, Viśvavarūpa Śaṅkarācārya, he's in Purī Śaṅkarācārya and (Hindi) ...and about 800 rooms in that Paratmaniketan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eight hundred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Eight hundred rooms. Very big temple and the daily income is about more than 1500 rupees per day, donation. I still get from three months. His speech is at nights, their <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> But if you see that practical life, you realize all this <span class="Italic">tīrthas,</span> what you call? They are no more <span class="Italic">tīrthas</span> now. All (indistinct) use that word shopping centers, what we call. I have been to the Sivananda Ashram. Some Cidanandaji is there. Sivanandaji is no more. When I went to Yoganiketan, there is one Gangesvarananda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cidananda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Cidananda is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> He is a disciple of Swami Sivananda, Divine Life Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is dead now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> No, Sivananda is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Cidananda is the in-charge of that institute, Divine Life Society. There is another Yogesvarananda. There is Upaniketan trust. They are having three years' course for regular yoga. And there is some (indistinct) Mahesh Yogi, transcendental meditation (indistinct) <span class="Italic">samādhi.</span> I lived there for fifteen days, tried to get something out of that. Everywhere I found there is no... We are after peace. There is no peace there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda, you say that religion is the law of God. So that means there can only be one religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. God is one, (indistinct) for everyone. (indistinct) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So all others are just contaminated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if they follow the rules, God, God said that "You just surrender unto Me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> So natural laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the religion. God says that "You surrender unto Me." This is religion. So if one does not know what is God and where to surrender, then where is religion? Is it wrong for God to say that "You surrender unto Me"? Can you say like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> How, how can you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If God is the supreme, He has the right to say like that. Just as the government can say that "Must obey." So if the government can say this, the head of the supreme government, if He says that "You surrender." What is wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Nothing wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is clear. Simple, two words. Unfortunately they want to deny God. They take the place of God, all these Māyāvādīs. <span class="Italic">Ānandam,</span> mostly. So that is rascaldom. How you can take the position of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they want to take the position of God. "Everyone is God. I am God, you are God." This is they are claiming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Bhagavan Rajneesh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many rascals. Why Rajneesh? There are many other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> There are others, Satya Sai Baba, and so many others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. What? People also do not ask that "How you become God?" That's also so foolish. They accept any rascal as God. That Rajneesh, what he is? He advertises "Bhagavān," and there are many rascals, they accept him. What he has done? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> How to stop it then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Stop, but unless you are intelligent, how it can be stopped? If the people are not intelligent, the cheaters will cheat. It is very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> But Swamiji, mostly educated persons, Ph.D, D.Litt., M.A., postgraduates, they are the followers of this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> They are supposed to be very learned but actually they're fools, <span class="Italic">māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> These so-called educated, they are bereft of knowledge. They have no common sense. That I was asking this debauch, as God. That also ignorance. He does not know what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Yes, because education is no education now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not know. We have got the definition of God,</div>

Now so far Kṛṣṇa is concerned, He showed all these things. <span class="Italic">Aiśvaryasya...</span> For example Kṛṣṇa married sixteen thousand wives and for each wife a different palace. And for each wife ten sons. Woman requires very nice accommodation, sons, husband, that is their ambition that He fulfilled, although he married sixteen thousand one hundred and eight wives. This is <span class="Italic">aiśvaryasya samāgrasya vīryasya.</span> This so-called rascal Bhagavān, who has shown this? Why shall I accept this cheap god? Show me something that you are God. Seven years old Kṛṣṇa, He lifted the Govardhana hill. (Hindi) There is, but they have no knowledge to compare with the idea of God. So far knowledge is concerned, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> left by Kṛṣṇa, it is adored all over the world. Especially nowadays we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> and millions of copies we are selling. Now we are advertising, where is that picture?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Teaching is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> I mean for teaching too. As far as books...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Saxena:</span> Yes, there should be centers too, could give right interpretation to all these things. Because interpretation means, everybody is not in contact with Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But in the books Śrīla Prabhupāda has given elaborate purports.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Word to word meaning. You have seen our books?</div>
