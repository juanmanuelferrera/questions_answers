<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they were not crying very loudly, but the grandfather inquired, "So why there is, it appears there is some great suffering?" So my father's eldest brother, he inquired, "Is your mother dead?" I consider like that, no, no. "So I am also dead." He died later on. Next day. He simply inquired, "I think your mother is dead." They said, "No, no." "No, I am also going to," and he died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> These things are not very wonderful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From spiritual point of view this has no meaning. This is worldly affection. It is worldly affection. That is not very good asset for spiritual life. <span class="Italic">Āsakti.</span> One has to give up <span class="Italic">āsakti.</span> That is the process, renouncement. Voluntarily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Anāsakta-manaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anāsaktya.</span> Yes. Our Vedic process is that at a certain age you must retire from family life. Voluntary, forceful, giving up association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> Even there is worship (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So these are <span class="Italic">āsaktis.</span> This husband and wife dying together, it is admitted(?) because <span class="Italic">āsakti</span> is there. That <span class="Italic">āsakti</span> will help him, that the wife will become a husband next life, and the husband will become wife next. And in that way they'll have to take birth again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> Soul has got no tax.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma-bandha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Karma-bandha</span> and <span class="Italic">jīva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Find out this verse, Fifth Canto, Fifth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> <span class="Italic">Karmātmakaṁ yena?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, <span class="Italic">śarīra-bandha. Parābhavas tāvad abodha-jāto yāvan na jijñāsata ātma-tattvam, yāvat mano vai karma?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bandha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "As long as one does not inquire about the spiritual values of life, one is defeated and subjected to miseries arising from ignorance. Be it sinful or pious, <span class="Italic">karma</span> has its resultant actions. If a person is engaged in any kind of <span class="Italic">karma,</span> his mind is called <span class="Italic">karmātmaka,</span> colored with fruitive activity. As long as the mind is impure, consciousness is unclear. And as long as one is absorbed in fruitive activity, he has to accept a material body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. By <span class="Italic">lābha-yoga</span> (?) woman will become man and the man will become woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> So long you are taking birth...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What action you have got? Before that the verse is,</div>
<div class="Verse">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma<br class="calibre2"/>yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam<br class="calibre2"/>asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.4]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">So this body is temporary, but it is very miserable. That they do not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Kuṇape tri-dhātuke.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they do not understand. That as soon as you accept a material body, either a very rich man's body or poor man's body or any body, either <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>'s body or <span class="Italic">śūdra</span>'s body, to accept material body means undergo miseries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> But you have no choice to accept. By the will of God...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have got... You can become free. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti kaunteya [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">. Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakti-avyabhicāriṇī</span>. I have got that tendency, <span class="Italic">bhakti, avyabhicāriṇī-bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, simply to know Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Māṁ ca 'vyabhicāreṇa bhakti-yogena ya...</span> So you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa without <span class="Italic">bhakti. Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> So without <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> there is no possibility to understand Kṛṣṇa. But if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then you'll become free from this process of accepting material body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is only business, to become Kṛṣṇa conscious and avoid this botheration of repeating body, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]. Dehāntara-prāptiḥ</span> is there. If you want to stop <span class="Italic">dehāntara-prāptiḥ,</span> then you have to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. There is no other way. But if you think that it is very pleasure to enter within the womb of mother and accept one body, and again come out and again work, and again die, and again enter. <span class="Italic">Bhūtvā bhūtvā pralīyate [Bg. </span>8.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> If you want this business, that is your choice. You can do it. But if you want to stop it, then this is the only way. Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">na sādhu manye.</span> It is not good. <span class="Italic">Nūnam,</span> read that verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Harikeśa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma<br class="calibre2"/>yad indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sādhu manye yata ātmano 'yam<br class="calibre2"/>asann api kleśada āsa dehaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>5.5.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: </span><span class="Italic">Kleśada āsa dehaḥ. Kleśada, as soon as you get a body, kleśada. May ha</span>ve good doctor friend, but I'll have to suffer. We can get some relief, but suffering is there. Therefore <span class="Italic">na sādhu manye.</span> It is not good. So people are being trained up to become mad, <span class="Italic">pramattaḥ.</span> And do anything, bring money. This is the modern civilization. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Things which are forbidden, they are doing that. Why? <span class="Italic">Indriya-prītaya āpṛṇoti, </span>only for sense gratification. They have no other ambition. Bring money and gratify senses. This is modern civilization. This is the exact explanation-<span class="Italic">nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> Black money, white money, this money, that..., never mind, bring money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> (laughter) By any way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is modern civilization. Big man, big rich man means bring money some way or other. This is big man. This is Kali-yuga. Because if you have got money, you have got respect, you have got honor, you are recognized. So therefore they are after money. Bring money, that's all right. When I shall get money, I may have done black money, force money, this money, nobody will remember it. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> This is modern civilization. Bring money and enjoy sense. <span class="Italic">Nūnaṁ pramattaḥ kurute vikarma [SB </span>5.5.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> What for it is, struggle so much working hard? <span class="Italic">Yad indriya-prītaya.</span> Only for the satisfaction of the senses. They have no other ambition. Because most of them, they do not believe there is next life. Most of them, 99.9 percent, they do not believe. Big, big professor, I have talked with so many big, big men in Europe. They have no... Our leaders also. The Munshi, he did not believe in the next life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> There is research in parapsychology in certain municipality(?) of India, they have proved that (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they may do, a very great service, but we know it without going to the psychological process. We believe Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">], bas,</span> finished. What is the use of going to the psychology and...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> But those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, those who are fools, they may waste their time in that way. (laughter) But we are not so fool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> They are fools to not to think that they'll become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are rascal fools because they do not take Kṛṣṇa's word. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Why should we bother? Our mission is simply to propagate Kṛṣṇa's instructions. This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. We don't manufacture anything. So-called yoga, so-called meditation, so-called this and... We don't care for all this nonsense. Our only business is how to implement the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, the rascals may understand and be happy. That is our mission. We haven't got to manufacture anything. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission. <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> You simply carry the message of Kṛṣṇa and try to deliver it to anyone you meet. This is our... We haven't got to manufacture anything. Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is. Take it, without interpretation. Don't spoil the whole thing. Interpretation means spoiling. Whole thing spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian doctor:</span> Each man understands according to his own level of understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Suppose, just like you are medical man, you are giving somebody medicine, you are giving the direction. If he wants to be cured, he must take your direction. Not that somebody comes, "No, no, you can take it this way, you can do this." That is nonsense. That is nonsense. This nonsense we want to stop. Kṛṣṇa is giving the instruction, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> the Supreme Personality of Godhead. What business you have got to poke your nose and give interpretation? Are you bigger than Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa left it for you? This nonsense going on. Big, big swamis, big, big yogis, big, big politicians, simply misinterpreting, he's spoiling his own life and he's spoiling others. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> This is going on. Very serious condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You are not going to go down now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Would you like to go on the terrace, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I like, I can... (conversation in Hindi) Why I have taken so much trouble?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They are already traced out. So we come here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you come and preach. The country is going to hell, the human society is going to hell for misguidance. These rascal leaders, they're going to hell themselves and they're leading others. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānās te 'pīśa-tantryām uru-dāmni baddhāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> These fools and rascals are leading, they are going to hell, and they are taking the followers to the hell. This is going on. Stop this. At least in India. Save. That is real <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission.</div>
<div class="Verse">bhārata-bhūmite haila manuṣya-janma yāra<br class="calibre2"/>janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra<br class="calibre2"/>[Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Para-upakāra. Our India is not meant for exploiting others. Doing good to others, that is India's mission. Our teachers, our <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> do not teach us "Go and exploit others and bring money"-British Empire. This is not India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> Even Jesus never taught that. These are the wrong followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jesus is different thing than that. I mean to say generally, generally, the people they want to exploit others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> It is the greed of the human being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, but the mission should be, human being should be meant for doing good to others. <span class="Italic">Para-upakāra.</span> That <span class="Italic">para-upakāra</span> spirit is gone on account of losing our own culture. Otherwise, India's culture is <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> India was open, "Come everyone, learn." Lord Jesus Christ also came here. All the Chinese, learned scholars, they used to come. The history is there. And India was open. <span class="Italic">Gṛhe śatrum api prāptaṁ viśvastam akutobhayam.</span> This is Indian culture. Even the enemy comes, "Yes, please come, you stay." But later on, they took advantage: "Oh, they are very liberal, enter there." And still we are liberal. "Please come here, stay here and take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> free, and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Open to everyone. I shall manage anyway, I shall travel, still I shall lay down my life and bring money. Come here, stay. Still we are liberal. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, <span class="Italic">janma sārthaka kari' kara para-upakāra</span> [Cc. <span class="calibre3">Ādi</span> 9.41]<span class="Italic">.</span> First of all, make your life successful by Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Then do good to others. Yesterday, I think, in Tehran, one boy came. He proposed that is it not good to help others? I immediately challenged, "What you have got you can help? What is your asset?" You cannot help. It is simply bogus proposition. If you can help, you can simply help by spreading Kṛṣṇa consciousness, as Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Sir, I have come to you." "Why?" "To request you that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious." "How?" <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ,</span> "Always think of Me, just become My devotee, offer little obeisances." Anyone can do, a child can do. You cannot do? What is the difficulty to become Kṛṣṇa conscious? Is there any difficulty? You haven't got to practice any yoga process, pressing your nose or keeping your head or this or that, no. Nothing. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru mām evaiṣyasi asaṁśayaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Without any doubt you are coming back to Me." And that is the highest perfection, <span class="Italic">tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no difficulty in preaching this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no difficulty to accept it. And the result is the supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> These are the people who have no faith.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to canvass. They have no faith, I know that. Then why there is necessity of preaching all over the world? They have no faith, it is a fact. And you have to create faith. That is preaching. <span class="Italic">Padayor nipatya.</span> That Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī,</div>
<div class="Verse">dante nidhāya tṛṇakaṁ padayor nipatya<br class="calibre2"/>kṛtvā ca kāku-ś atam etad ahaṁ bravīmi<br class="calibre2"/>he sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya dūrād<br class="calibre2"/>gaurāṅga-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is preaching. Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, what is that? <span class="Italic">Kāku-śataṁ padayor nipatya, kāku-śatam kṛtvā, śatam,</span> "I fall down on your feet and I am flattering you with folded hands." "Why? Why? What do you want to say?" "Yes, I have to say something." "What is that? Say it! Why you are becoming so humble?" "Yes, I have to say." "What? Say it!" <span class="Italic">He sādhavaḥ,</span> "You are a very nice <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> But you forget all nonsense."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> That's <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-upakāra.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">He sādhavaḥ sakalam eva vihāya,</span> "Whatever nonsense you have learned-forget." Then what to do? <span class="Italic">Kāku-śataṁ bravīmi sakalam eva vihāya dūrād gaurāṅga-candra-caraṇe kurutānurāgam.</span> "You just become devotee of Lord Caitanya. I am flattering you, I am falling down on your feet"-this is preaching. And what is Caitanya Mahāprabhu? <span class="Italic">Yāre dekha tāre kaha kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.</span> And if you do that, then what is the result? <span class="Italic">Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> If one is doing like that, Kṛṣṇa immediately recognizes, "Oh, you are the best friend of Mine." So if you are recognized by Kṛṣṇa, then what you want more? You are undergoing so much austerities and... To be recognized by God. And God says that "Immediately I recognize you." Whom? One who is doing this. <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">. Na ca tasmān manuṣyeṣu kaścin me priya-kṛttamaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.69]<span class="Italic">.</span> Immediately. You may be a fool, you may be rascal, you may be illiterate. But if you do this, immediately Kṛṣṇa recognizes. Kṛṣṇa never said that unless one is a big grammarian, big scientist, big politician, big engineer, big doctor, then I can do it. No. Simply one who does this. <span class="Italic">Ya idaṁ paramaṁ guhyam</span> [Bg 18.68]<span class="Italic">.</span> What is that <span class="Italic">paramaṁ guhyam</span>? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Give up all nonsense. Surrender to Me." This is <span class="Italic">paramaṁ guhyam.</span> And they are simply manufacturing nonsense. So the time is very bad, but nature's law is very strict. We may defy it, "There is no God, there is no next birth, there is no nothing." We may say like that, but when death will come, you cannot say anything. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham [Bg. </span>10.34<span class="Italic">]. Bas,</span> all your talkings, all your intelligence taken away. <span class="Italic">Tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Immediately transferred to another body. <span class="Italic">Daiva-netreṇa.

So (Hindi) They are talking, "Yes, you take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> without Kṛṣṇa." They say it, and they are doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Doctor:</span> Who?</div>
