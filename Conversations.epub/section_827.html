<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness, there is one very nice cause. The cause is, the Western people, they have no attachment for wife. Is it not a fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not care for the wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> They do not care for family attachment in general.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> is due to frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever the cause...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> is there. That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then you came and gave the missing link. You gave the Kṛṣṇa consciousness itself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> means that there must be another engagement. Then life is successful, with another spiritual engagement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That you have supplied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I have studied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> You must have known that before you went to the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. Kṛṣṇa wanted to preach Kṛṣṇa consciousness in the Western countries, so He gave me the chance to take the credit, that's all. It is Kṛṣṇa's arrangement. But He liked that one of His devotee may take the credit. That's all. <span class="Italic">Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin.</span> Kṛṣṇa said to Arjuna that "I have already killed them. They are not returning, either you fight or not fight, but you can take the credit." So it was arrangement of Kṛṣṇa that Western countries should now have this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And He wanted to give the credit to His poor servant. That's all. Kṛṣṇa likes that. He does everything, but He gives credit to His (chuckling) poor servant. That is my..., <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> The whole process is how to achieve <span class="Italic">vairāgya. Vāsudeve bhagavati bhakti-yogaḥ prayojitaḥ, janayaty āśu vairāgyam...</span> [SB 1.2.7].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">jñānaṁ ca yad ahaitukam.</span> That was automatic. And the <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> means <span class="Italic">vairāgya-yoga. Vairāgya-yogaṁ nija-bhak.... Vairāgya-vidyā-nija-bhakti-yogam</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 6.254]<span class="Italic">.</span> So anyway, you have got the right thing. Now make it perfect. <span class="Italic">Satataṁ kīrtayanto māṁ yatantaś ca dṛḍha-vratāḥ [Bg. </span>9.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> With great vow and endeavor, <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> should go on. Then it is perfect. There is no difficulty. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> is <span class="Italic">bhajana.</span> So if you are engaged, <span class="Italic">satatam,</span> in <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> then you are safe. <span class="Italic">Māyā's</span> father will not be able to touch. In India as soon as you say, "You give up your family life," immediately he becomes morose. The family attachment, especially the wife's attachment, is very, very strong. And <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says if one can give up this attachment of wife, then he can conquer Kṛṣṇa. It is said. He can conquer Kṛṣṇa. Simply.... Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a ditch here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> There's a place to walk, though, on the left-hand side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] ...from his fallible soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Fallible soldiers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fallible soldier? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Sometimes I say to young boys, "You are seeking protection from your parents in your childhood, and then, when you grow old or when you grow older, they will want protection from you, because they will become old and feeble. So where is the protection? There is actually no protection." And everyone can easily understand that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Protection is ultimately Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is all false thought that "He is giving me protection. He is giving me..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. And the same person who is giving me protection, later he will ask me for protection, and then I will ask somebody else...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, even when the father-mother is supposed to give protection, that is also not right conclusion. Otherwise there are so many fathers and mothers who is giving protection to his children. The father-mother, when the child is sick, the father-mother gives all-one who has got means-best medicine, best medical treatment, but the child dies. Where is the protection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. Even that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So there's actually no protection in any case.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody was.... Some bird was killed here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> [break] Sometimes we see a big house and at least two or three generations are all living together, same two or three families, his mother, his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is joint family, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, joint families. And because of that, the attachment is very strong, it appears.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? After the Battle of Kurukṣetra there were many men killed. How were all the young people and the women protected after so many millions of men were killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you mean by protection?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, I mean like Arjuna was arguing that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That was also.... That was condemned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, that argument was not accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That argument was not accepted by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> But I mean, then how...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He proved that "You are a rascal. One who puts this argument, he's a rascal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That was just an excuse to avoid fighting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa clearly chastised him that "You are talking like a fool." Eh? <span class="Italic">Aśocyān anvaśocas tvaṁ prajñā-vādān: [</span>Bg. 2.11] "Talking like a very learned man, but you are a fool. No learned man speaks like that." Why they have kept this nice road within this forest? What is the idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's some village on the other side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, for village the government is not going to keep such nice road. This government department, forest department.... The government policy is to develop these places for industry in future. This industry is the cause of falldown of the human society-industry. So the reaction is.... The industry, two things required-four things required: land, labor, capital, and organization. So now the industry is going on, and the capitalists and labor, there is fight. The laborers, they are finding out that "We are working. Why the capitalists will take the profit?" This is communism. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the Communists, they are thinking, "By changing the hand, things will improve." But they do not know that very industry is the cause of falldown. They're simply trying to change the hand. The principle should go on, industry, only the proposal is that the capitalists should give up and the workers should take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Which way is India headed towards? The capitalists or the Communists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> India has no, had no such ideas. They are borrowing ideas. India's idea is self-realization. Live very simple life-<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> they are living simple life, becoming very learned scholar, pure character, advanced in spiritual life-one class, ideal. And <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> they are supposed to be the king. They distribute the land on nominal taxation, and the <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> utilize the land for cultivation and cow-keeping, and the <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> they are engaged as weaver, blacksmith, goldsmith, mean other necessities of life. In this way the whole society is simplified, and the central point is how to become advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by cooperation. This is India's civilization. There is no question of industry. <span class="Italic">Ugra-karma.</span> It has been condemned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as <span class="Italic">ugra-karma,</span> laboring very hard for livelihood. This industry means engage the poor worker class to work very hard, and there is huge profit, and some directors of the capitalists, they take it. And they have one dozen motorcars, palatial building, no work, simply wine and woman, that's all. This is going on. And the others, they are seeing: "There is no classification, neither real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> nor <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> nor <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> So he is enjoying like that. He has got so many cars. He has got such a nice apartment. Why not me?" There is struggle. This is actual picture. Our Vedic advice is that make life very simple. You must have some means of livelihood. Keep your body and soul together. So according to quality, <span class="Italic">guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">,</span> there must be division and then simple life. The real aim is <span class="Italic">tam abhyarcya,</span> how to become Kṛṣṇa conscious. Everyone is.... <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> is guiding, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> is ruling, and <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> is producing food, and <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> they have no brain; they are helping. In this way the society is very peaceful, and everyone is advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is India's civilization. Now, due to this association of the <span class="Italic">rākṣasas...</span> Even up to Mohammedan time this civilization was being continued. Mohammedan did not touch the Indian culture. Sometimes by, what is called, fanaticism, there was fight. Not like this. The Arjuna.... Aurangzeb began this. Otherwise, from, what is called, the first emperor? Akbar. Akbar, Jahanghri, then Shajahan, there was no trouble. They did not touch. Even there was some marriage connection. They want to remain as <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> king, that's all. The other things were not interfered. So instead of a Hindu <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> the Musselman <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> People were satisfied: "A <span class="Italic">kṣatriya...</span> We have to work. Somebody must be king." So in this way the Indian people accepted the Britishers. "All right, you remain king. Don't interfere." But later on, to exploit the whole country, they began to plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Industry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The industry, railway, and this way, that way, European way of life. And the result was they were kicked out. And India is now trying to perfect...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> The same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same thing. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Tragedy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tragedy, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last year, when Governor Reddy was here, you were talking with him how "Let there simply be the government's position to check and see that everyone is following their particular religion."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is government's position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So how would, for example, the government.... In a perfect society, how would the government check to see that the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are actually practicing, and how would...?</div>
<div class="Normal-Level"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is.... The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa...</span> This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This formula is there. <span class="Italic">Satya śamo damas titikṣā ārjava.</span> So you have to see whether he is possessing this quality. Or train them. Have brahminical school, what I am willing to do. That is required absolutely. There must be a class of men, perfect <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Otherwise society will be ruined. In the Western countries there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> There may be some <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> and <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> only, and <span class="Italic">śūdras. Brāhmaṇa</span> there is none. So the same thing is here also now. Therefore the whole society is going down. There is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> What is this? This is brahminical culture. We are asking them not to be sinful, become devotee. This is brahminical culture. <span class="Italic">Namo brahmaṇya-devāya go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca.</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness means <span class="Italic">go-brāhmaṇa-hitāya ca,</span> for the benefit of brahminical culture and cow protection. That is brahminical culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> So to be recognized as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> To be recognized, our men will have to be, as you were saying yesterday, perfect gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> means perfect gentleman. <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> means perfect gentleman. A rogue, thief, cannot become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> is perfect gentleman. Who feels for others, that is gentleman. Who does not feel for others, for his sense gratification, he is a rogue. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> a gentleman, must feel that "Why there should be animal killing?" That is gentleman. If you are killed, you cry and you are.... Hundreds and thousands of animals you are killing on the plea that they have no soul? Lowest class, <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> They have been described as <span class="Italic">narādhama.</span> So <span class="Italic">narādhama</span> civilization, how he can be happy? There must be frustration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yesterday, Śrīla Prabhupāda, four or five people stopped me while I was in a bus during the day, and they would stop me and look at me with <span class="Italic">tilaka</span> and etcetera, and say, "Why have you given up your Western life and taken to this life?" (Prabhupāda laughs) They were amazed. And then I had a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> and I'd show them your picture, and I'd show them the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> and say, "<span class="Italic">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<span class="Italic">,</span> a higher taste." And then they would appreciate. They would.... They were so impressed by your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> They looked at your picture, and they'd go, "Yes, yes, you are right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in my Preface I have written that: "What is the necessity of the human society?" This is this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is required. It is a mistake to understand that we are trying to push on Hindu culture. Where is the Hindu culture? To become a gentleman is Hindu culture? It is for everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> They think that their paraphernalia makes them gentlemen. If they have a big car and a nice house then they are gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he may be great rogue, that "Simply dress yourself nicely; you become gentleman."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Usually materially opulent people are puffed up and mean. They're not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gentleman means that if you go to a gentleman's store, "Beware of the dog. Beware of the revolver." This is your culture. And when you go to the airport everyone is searched out, pocket. So who is gentleman? Is that gentleman? There is no gentleman in the world. All rogues and thieves, cheaters, bluffers. Now we are creating gentlemen. Otherwise there is no gentlemen. Here is the proof. If we are gentleman, why we are being checked in the airport? Hm? This is the proof. There is no gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because they're not expecting any gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means there is no.... In other words, there is no gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. They're only expecting rogues.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes.... In most cases they do not check me. "This is gentleman." And there is all..., no gentlemen. And this is the test, how to test a gentleman, that one who is not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa.... Or one who is surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is gentleman. Kṛṣṇa says that</div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So anyone who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, he is not gentleman. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span> That is the test. He is not a gentleman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Just like that man yesterday, that farmer, was so polite.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he is gentleman. He is Kṛṣṇa conscious. This can be used very nice <span class="Italic">dako</span>(?) If you stack it nicely, you can use as <span class="Italic">dako</span>(?). It is very good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> [break] Cintāmaṇi gate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the Vaiṣṇavas in general in Vṛndāvana, are they lamenting for the physical upkeep?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Are the Vaiṣṇavas in general lamenting for the physical upkeep of Vṛndāvana, or are they indifferent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is the business of the government. Vaiṣṇava can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> anywhere. He doesn't require any nice park. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> For becoming Kṛṣṇa conscious, for a serious person, there is no obstacle. Any condition he can do it. [break] ...why there is <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>? In the Vedic civilization, ultimately <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Why? That one must give up the intimate relationship with wife. This is the ultimate position. <span class="Italic">Brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Tamo-dvāraṁ yoṣitāṁ saṅgī-saṅgam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is recommended everywhere. Illicit or legal.... Mahāprabhu has said, <span class="Italic">asat eka strī-saṅgī:</span> "Anyone who is attached to woman, he is <span class="Italic">asat.</span>" <span class="Italic">Bas</span>. This is the whole process, how to become detached from the attraction of woman, <span class="Italic">dhīra.</span> [break] Give up the connection with woman is recommended. So in our society it will be a good test. We are mixed up with men and women. If you in spite of this allurement, if you do not become attracted by woman, then you should know you are <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Yes. You are worshipable. And this <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-dharma</span> is meant for the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas. Paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is especially. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita.</span> The other different types of regulated system, to become very religious man or to become very expert money-hunter or accumulation of money, <span class="Italic">dharma, artha,</span> and enjoying sense enjoyment-the whole world is appreciating these men, who is a religious man, who is very much able to satisfy his senses, dozens of cars and three dozen women, naked dance. They are taking this. <span class="Italic">Dharma artha kāma.</span> And somebody is trying <span class="Italic">mokṣa,</span> being baffled or dissatisfied: "These things will not.... I shall become one with." So <span class="Italic">dharma artha kāma mokṣa [SB 4.8.41, Cc. Ādi 1.90].</span> So <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, "These are all kicked out." <span class="Italic">Paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> For the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas.</span> So anyone who is freed from all these allurement, he is <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> And this <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa-saṁhitā,</span> it is called, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.... Paramahaṁsa-saṁhitā. Bhāṣyaṁ brahma-sūtrāṇām</span><i class="calibre3"> **<span class="Italic"></span></i>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> We also should be free from the extension of this, which is profit, adoration, and distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> We also should be free from profit, adoration and distinction, which are just extensions of these desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A Vaiṣṇava does not require any, what is adoration or distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a line of preaching in our society that subtle manifestation of sex attraction is adoration, profit, and distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is.... Mahāprabhu says, <span class="Italic">tṛṇād api sunīcena.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's another path going this way if you'd like to walk some more, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...that garden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where so many men come there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> And it is just near our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Very calm and quiet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Very pleasant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we shall go this way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's okay. The car is just back here when you want to go back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> On one tape in America you said that the Westerners have created many, many parks, but because they are so busy trying to work hard for money they cannot take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Therefore we will come early in the morning and take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is our <span class="Italic">ājagara-vṛtti. Ājagara-vṛtti</span> means we haven't got to work for anything. Everything should be done by others, and we shall take possession of it. (laughter) Just like the Americans. They have earned so much money, and I have gone there and taking possession. I am not more clever than the Americans? (laughs) "Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and give money. I'll take to India." What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> You once gave the example of a mouse. The mouse digs a hole, and then the snake comes along and takes the house away from the mouse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And eats him. The mouse makes very comfortable home by digging, and the snake comes, he enters without any labor, and the mouse is there and he eats it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> Free food and free home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">ājagara-vṛtti.</span> What is that? Python. <span class="Italic">Ājagara-vṛtti</span> and <span class="Italic">madhukāra-vṛtti.</span> For your necessities of life either you take <span class="Italic">ājagara-vṛtti</span> or <span class="Italic">madhukāra-vṛtti. Madhukāra</span> means the fly, honeybee, bees. They take little from this flower, little from this flower, and they stock it, and somebody comes and takes it away. Don't stock. Therefore we have to follow this, that whatever money is coming, spend it for publication or for constructing temple. No account in the bank. Finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> [break] ...is that no one can be contaminated by it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that blessing for them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> As soon as I have five dollars, I'm thinking that "Now I have five dollars. I can..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> I'm thinking, "Now I have five dollars. I can purchase something. What shall I buy?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? If you don't require anything, why should you purchase? Don't create artificial demand. If you require to purchase something, then purchase. That is material civilization. "I don't require it; still I want it." <span class="Italic">Atyāhāra.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">atyāhāraḥ prayāsaś ca<br class="calibre2"/>prajalpo niyamāgrahaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>jana-saṅgaś ca laulyaṁ ca<br class="calibre2"/>ṣaḍbhir bhaktir vinaśyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [NoI 2]</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para">Finish. We should not possess anything which is not absolutely necessary. We are keeping these cars for preaching facility, not for sense gratification. We are keeping this dictaphone for preaching facility. Otherwise why it should be required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is the whole mentality, then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa: :</span>The whole mentality is changed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like the Kurukṣetra fight. Kṛṣṇa wanted; therefore he fought. Personally he did not want. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
