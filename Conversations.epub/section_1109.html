<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">...Dialectic Spiritualism.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You have taken their word.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not their words, but just to counter...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In fact, sir, Engels was a spiritualist, and his <span class="Italic">chela,</span> Karl Marx, became materialist because he saw, accept poverty all round, due to the industrial revolution. He thought in that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As if he was ordained to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But, well, he felt... He was a philosopher.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such a rascal. He has moved poverty. He was in poverty-stricken...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He was extremely poor man. Yes, he died (indistinct). But that is what he thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means poor fund of knowledge. That's it. These rascals will never go to the... <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know this science, these rascals. They manufacture. And we have also learned to manufacture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, he did only on the Western thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Western philosophy... We have learned this art, manufacturing. Just like Vinoba Bhave's has proposed, "I want <span class="Italic">mukti</span> not in the traditional way." He'll manufacture his own way. This is his intelligence after eighty-two years or eighty-one years. "Not in the traditional, not in the religious way." Just see. He's still hovering in darkness, and he's going to get <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Prabhupāda has said that the Russian intelligence and Indian culture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, I may tell you. Russians are not that intelligent. I have very poor regard for the Russian intelligence. Intelligence is not with Russians that much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No, no, all Europeans, they're very intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Especially Germans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're very intelligent. Germans are extraordinarily...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> The Aryan races are intelligent, and in Russia there is a mixture...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are Aryans. They are Aryans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Mixture, Aryan as well as the yellow race.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mixture everywhere now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, here... I mean, so far as the Eastern European countries, they are more or less pure. They are mixed in a way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, we are not on that platform, we or anyone. We think we are on the... Everyone in the material platform, more or less, they are rascals, here or there. The Bengali is <span class="Italic">guhyera epi han opi.</span> You know this? Stool, this side or that side, Eastern side or Western side, it is, after all, stool. (laughs) If somebody says, "Eastern side of the stool is very good," that is his foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> After the scattering of these Aryans, they have come different place. How is it that we brought all the cultural heritage in north, east and western countries? They must have also taken. But because they have to live very hard life, they are in cold countries...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what do you mean by "we"? We are not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "We" means our forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Forefathers may be saintly person, but we are not. Why do you say "we"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "We" means the descendants of our forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My father might have been very rich man, but I am a poverty-stricken man, loitering in the street. Why say "we"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> "We" means these Aryans in India, they brought all the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and Vedic culture with them. They must have taken it in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. One who is speaking, he is not in Vedic culture. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I talk of these historical facts, sir. Historically, Eastern European races are just our cousin. I mean the Indian races. But still, they have not been able to take the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, falsely to become proud: "We... We have done." What I am at the present? That is to be taken, not that... Now in Bengal... "Fourteen generations before my father took <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> and I have got a smell." (laughs) What is that? Whether you are eating <span class="Italic">ghee</span> or not, that is talk, not that "Fourteen generations before my father and forefathers ate <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> and I have got the smell here." (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, we talk of Vedic culture, sir.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic culture is all right now. There is no question of "we" or "you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But why it is not with them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why it is not with <span class="Italic">you</span>? First of all say why you are challenging them? (laughter) First of all challenge yourself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (laughing) That's right. But they have not, their forefathers have got. We have at least with our forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, their forefathers are the Aryans, the same forefathers, your forefathers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> They're Aryans, but they did not take the Vedic culture with them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They did not take. You are not taking. That's the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Presently the whole world is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all. That is our concern, how the world is misdirected. That we are challenging, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is not that "East," "West," "you," "I." Everyone is a victim. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">prāyena kalau asmin yuga-jana:</span> "In this age everyone is condemned." It doesn't say that "These Eastern, Western..." Everyone is condemned. <span class="Italic">Kalau asmin yuga-jana.</span> That is impartial. (to Mahāṁsa:) How are you? Everything is all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So Badruka is the same?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> He came yesterday in the evening. I could not see him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, it is not yet registered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> No. As soon as I get back today, it will be registered. He came just yesterday in the evening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, what other news?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> We are just waiting to get some water facilities made so that we can start doing something in the meantime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The water is not yet there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> One building is finished. Now the pump has to be gotten for that. The second building, we didn't have... I wasn't over there. I had gone to South India to collect some money. And then, when I came back, the people had gone away because there was no money to be paid to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? I have already transferred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> That came just five days back. So now we'll be working on it full swing because we have some money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the bank has transferred?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the prospect is nice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People are coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> When I came... When I went to the South, to down South, there was about 270 people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes. But then, when I returned, there was only fifty people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Because the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> quantity was cut down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why cut down?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you don't know. Then who knows?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Well, Tejas and Haṁsadūta, they said to cut down the <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These nonsense ideas, why you make without asking? I am paying money. Why it should be cut down? Don't do anything nonsensical. This should be increased. I shall pay. Why you are anxious? So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Now when I get back I'm going to work on it and see that at least...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should come. Every evening they should come, as many as possible. Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Our mission is to induce them to chant and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Then, next stage, if they want to work with us, it is welcome. If not, we shall go on giving <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and induce them to chant. This is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The village people are very happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they should be. That I want. <span class="Italic">Sarve sukhino bhavantu.</span> This is our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The stone-cutting has also started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They're doing very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here we're inviting everyone, "Come here. Live here. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and chant. Don't drink tea. That's all." (chuckles) That is... Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> "No tea?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No tea, no cigarette. That is their disease. No tea, no... Don't stop <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Never. Increase. I shall beg and supply you money. Don't worry. But don't waste it. Simply you take money and utilize it for preaching. My only anxiety is that don't be extravagant. Otherwise you take money and spend it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Don't be extravagant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should always know that hard-earned money is... By working at night I am producing book, and they're working there hard, selling the books, and money is coming in that way. So either he or me, mine or yours, it is hard-earned money. It is not easily coming. And therefore we should be cautious. But there is no question of curtailing. There is no question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Now we are in the process of making a brochure so that we can present to trusts and foundations for bigger donations for the farm project.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. They have amassed money. Let them spend for this village organization. This is real Gandhi's program. He wanted this village organization. But because they manufactured their own way, it was not successful. But if we follow this principle, it will be successful, without any doubt. These big, big <span class="Italic">āśrama...</span> Gandhi's <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> is vacant. No. They are getting money, but they have no such program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It must be, because there is no solid program. There is no solid program, simply imagination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. Because the followers...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How there will be followers? If there is some program, then there will be followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He wanted to defend the commoners. He wanted to defend the order (indistinct). But he unfortunately died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone will die. But (Hindi). If you do something tangible, then you will live. And if you do something fictitious, then with your death everything is gone. (Hindi) But here the whole population is <span class="Italic">duṣkṛti.</span> They are <span class="Italic">kṛti,</span> but they are doing something wrong: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛti.</span> How? <span class="Italic">Prapanna prapa jante mām.</span> This is a miscon..., mischievous activity. Because he has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, whatever he has done, it is all mischievous. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why he has done mischievous activities, <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span>? The only test is, if one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, whatever he does it is all mischievous. So immediately go and you'll see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Every morning we go on <span class="Italic">nagara-kīrtana</span> to every village.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Yes, invite them. Invite them. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> This lady is coming from Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Indian lady?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi conversation with lady) You cannot do anything. Ultimately they will say no and for this they are paying (indistinct). (Hindi with lady) Very nice. You have got the desire and Kṛṣṇa will fulfill your desire. (Hindi) Then with practice, then it becomes successful. <span class="Italic">Ādau śraddhā tato sādhu-saṅgo 'tha bhajana-kriyā.</span> This Kṛṣṇa consciousness can be increased by gradual process. First thing, just like you have got faith, it is nice thing. This is <span class="Italic">śraddhā.</span> Then to associate with persons who are already engaged in this business, <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga [Cc. </span>Madhya 22.83]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is called <span class="Italic">sādhu-saṅga. Ādau śraddhā tato,</span> and then act like them, <span class="Italic">bhajana-kriyā.</span> Simply theoretical will not help.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (more Hindi conversation with S.P.)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where you have given her place, Girirāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> In the, one of the guest rooms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. (pause) <span class="Italic">Biragati, biranadi (?).</span> [break] ...to me. (indistinct) Not personally, but the daughter of the, wife of the, the mother of the, that is right position. Just like Kunti, she was the mother of <span class="Italic">Vir,</span> Arjuna's mother. Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> Should I read what I have written?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm, hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (reads a paper praising the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement and describing activities of groups against the movement-much of this indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually you have seen in our Māyāpura there is no question Hindu, Muslim, everyone takes <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> There is no question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (continues reading)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) It is great, fortunate that you are trying to understand. So if you try to understand this philosophy, you understand it is not the so-called religion, it is a culture for benefit of the whole human society, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's mission, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> Because people are in the darkness of knowledge, to enlighten them, to come to the light, that is Vedic injunction, <span class="Italic">tamasi mā jyotir gamaḥ.</span> Do not remain in darkness, come to the light. So our attempt is to bring these people who are kept in different types of, or different standards of darkness, to bring them to light. This is our position. It is not sectarian. Not for the Hindus, not for the Indians, but it is meant for the whole human society. Kṛṣṇa never said that He's Hindu or He's Indian. He says, <span class="Italic">sarva-yoniṣu kaunteya sambhavanti mūrtayaḥ tāsāṁ mahad yonir brahma ahaṁ bīja-pradaḥ pitā</span> [Bg. 14.4]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never says that "I am for the Hindu or for the Indians." <span class="Italic">Sarva-yoniṣu.</span> There are 8,400,000 species of different types of life. That is the fact, <span class="Italic">bījo 'haṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i> 7.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Wherefrom the life is coming? These rascals, they do not understand what is actual science, how things are going on, how the laws of nature is working. Simply superficially, "We have got some ideas." Fundamentally they have no knowledge. So we are trying to enlighten them with our teeny effort. Although it is single-handed, still it is genuine. If you kindly try to understand the whole philosophy-the first thing is, <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndair upanīyamānā,</span> the whole world is now being conducted by blind leaders. And they're keeping people in darkness because they are themselves in darkness. They do not know what is light. So they do not know what is the object of life, what is the destination of life. Simply in blind faith they have created so many isms. It is simply misleading. It is little difficult to understand that we are simply leading others... That's a fact, that's a fact. If you impersonally try to understand this philosophy that every man is kept in the darkness of a different stamp, different ism. That is the first instruction of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, tathā dehāntara-prāptir,</span> after death you have to change your body. Then where is your ism? Whole ism changed. That they do not understand. They're so much in darkness, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> "Today I am very great national leader, my country, my..." So on, so on. And tomorrow by the laws of nature if I become a dog in Europe, then where is my nationalism? And it is possible. What is called? Because you are under nature's law, you are not independent. Therefore they have given up this idea that there is life after death. This is their first ignorance. Everyone is thinking that this life is everything for twenty years or thirty years or hundred years-eat, drink, be merry, enjoy then everything is finished. The whole Russian people, they think like that. Not whole, I don't, I cannot say but the learned, their learned professors, they think like that. The life is ended after this body. So our people also, our these politicians, they also think like that. So this is the platform of ignorance. And people are so much (indistinct), born into this ignorance. It is very, very difficult to raise them from this ignorance. This is our task. The first business is to convince him that "Your life continues." <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> But it is very difficult for the modern man to understand. They have been so poorly educated that it is very difficult. But this is the first beginning of knowledge and if we are in the conception that "I am this body and the body is everything," then we are no better that the cats and dogs. So this is a movement to raise people from the platform of cats' and dogs' life. It is little difficult but we have to do it. That is our mission, Caitanya Mahāprabhu, <span class="Italic">para-upakāra.</span> They're living like cats and dogs, do something good for them so that they may live like actual human beings. This is our... So you kindly stay here for some days, read our books and if there is any question, doubt, I shall be very glad to enlighten you. But this is the fact, the whole world is misguided by the rascal leaders, I must say that. <span class="Italic">Andhā, andhā</span> is the last word of rascaldom, <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndair upanīyamānā.</span> If I say (to) somebody, "You are rascal." There is maybe, partially he may be intelligent. But when we say <span class="Italic">andhā, andhā,</span> then his life is... He cannot see anything. So that is the description given by <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam, na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇuṁ durāśayā [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are <span class="Italic">durāśayā,</span> hopelessly hopeful, trying to adjust things-<span class="Italic">bahir-artha-māninaḥ</span>-by external energy. Simply wasting time, it cannot be. This is the position. So we are trying little bit and if you help us, it is very kind of you. Everyone should help this movement, <span class="Italic">prāṇair arthair virair arcair,</span> by sacrificing life, <span class="Italic">artha</span> money, and intelligence. So you have moved amongst the higher circle, what is the opinion of our government men about this movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What is it our government people think about our movement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> (indistinct) I am not talk about now (indistinct) yesterday night. In Europe I have talked with my consulate-general (indistinct) I am helpless, you must go to India and talk about it and for this in India. It is very difficult here. Because our relation is not good to West Germany.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're so afraid they cannot say the truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> Their people don't like us. (indistinct-man says something to Prabhupāda in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, where is he? Good. Everything is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> German people don't like us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why we are liked? We are poor, who will like us? Poor man is never liked, especially in the western countries. They hate. And not only there, our Canakya Paṇḍita also says, <span class="Italic">daridra-doṣa guṇarāśī nāśī,</span> if you are poor then all your qualities are gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What is the disease?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So materially wherever I go, there any gentleman I meet, "Oh, you are coming from India, very poor (indistinct)." This is our (indistinct). Not now, fifty years ago in 1930's when one of my godbrothers, one or two they went to London, Lady Willingdon, she was speaking that "You people come here from India and we give you degrees and you earn your livelihood in India. So what you have come to teach us?" That's a fact. We go to England to take the degrees, MRCT, FRCA, barrister or so on, so on, so on.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He migrated to America. He married a (indistinct) girl, and he made a original discovery in genetic code, and then he got a Nobel prize. These people did not (indistinct).</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) ...we don't say like that. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He's very kind man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kind man, so we are not also bad man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, no, I don't mean that. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that this nationalism is... We have to go beyond that. Actually they're happening, these boys, they're not thinking in terms of nationalism. Otherwise he had no business to come to me and to start this. We are in a different platform, Kṛṣṇa-ism. That is our platform. So we shall go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (indistinct) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa is within you. If you actually want to serve Kṛṣṇa, he'll give you intelligence. He says personally, <span class="Italic">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam.</span> What kind of?-<span class="Italic">yena mām upayānti te.</span> So it is automatically available if you are sincerely desiring to serve Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Na toṣana chādiyā varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> So today... Actually I was thinking of phoning his wife because she was not well or one of our ladies could call her and then if she's still not well they could go and visit her. And if she is well, they could invite her that if she wants to come then she'll bring him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Don't bother. But as an etiquette (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Mr. Mota telephoned to say that that other man who was here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mashari.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> No, the Kapoor, the Punjabi man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That one is from (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes, he was not with Mota.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hariramdas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whose daughter, she called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. So Mota says that he's a very rich man and that man who came, we should approach his older brother and he says that they can give a very big donation. And they can introduce us to other Punjabis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. So whatever you sanction, it will not be good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Well, we had a confrontation that they want to break the condition that we have to hand over these ten feet. So I said that this is a separate issue and one thing had nothing to do with the other. So, actually they have accepted all of our arguments, what is boils down is that Mantrey is pressing them and they must, you know, why they are letting this slide by. So they say they want something to reply to him so we have to write a letter explaining our case. And...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mantrey is an all-in-all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He's not all-in-all, but he can make their life miserable. Because what he does is, if they don't satisfy him so he raises the issue of the corporation. He says this man is not doing his work properly, he should be transferred. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he is for them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He is their municipal councillor. He is the representative for this area in the municipal corporation, elected. So actually this came up before and at that time we met the municipal commissioner that they are trying to put this condition. So he agreed that this should be a, you know, decided by the court or by some third party and not, he will not do anything to change the status quo by forcing us. So we have to put that in the letter. And [break] ...hitch. Not a hitch exactly but there's this urban land ceiling that anyone who has more than 500 square yards property, that comes under the ceiling. So we are exempt because we are a charitable trust and apart from that, in the final plan, most of the land will be built up, it won't be vacant. But in order to get the sanction, we have to get either an N.O.C. (No Objection Certificate) that we are exempt from the ceiling or an exemption to get the N.O.C. So we have to meet some higher official. So I have to finalise it but I'm supposed to contact the architect and we have to go and see about this. Actually the management is so bad there that they have made this requirement that any new building, you have to get N.O.C. regarding the land ceiling. But so far they have not given one N.O.C. for land ceiling because they are not yet decided what is the policy to give the N.O.C. So they simply are piling up the applications until they decide their policy. So first we will try to get exemption that we don't require this N.O.C. Then if we fail in that then I suppose we have to meet the minister and ask him to give us the N.O.C.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not meet the minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not meet the minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes. We've met him once before because he's... The municipality is under him. So when we met the Chief Minister to get these things straightened out, so at that time he spoke to this Urban Affairs Minister. So he knows us, he's quite intelligent personally. But I think if... First we'll meet the city engineer, he's next to the commissioner and just say that we don't want to have to get this N.O.C. So if he removes that condition then the whole problem is solved. Do you think we should go straight to the minister?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harassment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Harassment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Oh, yes, completely. Their whole office, the papers are piled to the ceiling and people just waste hours (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If there is ceiling, then we can divide the land amongst ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> But that also they have blocked in the sense that in order to sell now that the ceiling is there, in order to sell your land you have to get another N.O.C. to sell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then, I cannot sell, I cannot use it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That's what I'm saying. They make it impossible. They say they want the country to develop quickly but they make it impossible to develop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today I think fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> Fasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have no appetite, I could not eat even breakfast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> So I will be here if you want something, you can call for me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. For the time being, no appetite. You can soak some little chipped rice in water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Lady:</span> Which?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Chipped rice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) in water. Soak it. Maybe if I feel hungry I shall take it. This is the condition of material world, simply harassing, this all these big, big government (indistinct). How to harass. The more you learn this art, how to harass, you become a big politician. Not <span class="Italic">para-upakāra. Mandāḥ sumanda matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ [SB </span>1.1.10]<span class="Italic">. Upadrutāḥ,</span> disturbing. <span class="Italic">Adhibautika,</span> one living entity is harassing another living entity, killing. So I have decided to construct a temple in Bhuvaneśvara. What do you think, shall I attempt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Of course that is our business to construct temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Temple (indistinct). Temple means preaching center. This Gurukula I have made for temple (indistinct) center. Now they have made it but that (indistinct). Purpose is, that whole world in the neophyte stage, they will (indistinct), <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad...,</span> think of Kṛṣṇa, offering obeisances, offer (indistinct) from the persons maintaining the temple (indistinct). Therefore they do not like that a temple should be constructed, it is waste of... (indistinct) ...must be engaged to work hard, produce money and enjoy sense gratification. Hog civilization. We are restricting that "Don't work hard like hog and dog or animals, just satisfy your minimal necessities of life, save time and (indistinct) spiritual understanding. This is our mission. Their mission is, "What is this nonsense, spiritual understanding? Simply some sentiment, waste of time. Produce, enjoy, invent so many things for sense gratification." Western civilization. And this is very attractive to the <span class="Italic">rākṣasa</span> class. Eat, drink, be merry and enjoy. This is the <span class="Italic">rākṣasa</span> mentality. As soon as there is television, or similar invention, they become very much enthused. They purchase and sitting down, they waste their time. I have seen in America the old man of family, one dog, one television, simply wasting time. And 50 cents for eat. How they are wasting the valuable human life. How they are kept in the darkness. This is life. I have seen television. All some fictitious stories. Here, trained position. They have manufactured one big hammer and training strongly and these rogues they are sending their hammer to train and as soon as the hammer... smashed. They want to see. One man kept ferocious dogs and one girl (indistinct) the dog is chasing and the girl is screaming (indistinct) so many (indistinct). You know this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There are millions...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Shooting, one man. (laughter) At least 50 cents stories (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> They could see stories of Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm? Mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> That is mythology.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And here is fact. So one side is: people are no more interested. (indistinct). This is our business. I think western countries the young men, they're joining this successfully. <span class="Italic">Adānta gobhir viśataṁ tamisraṁ punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> (indistinct) first part.

<div class="After-Verse">"Prahlāda Mahārāja replied: Because of their uncontrolled senses, persons too addicted to materialistic life make progress toward hellish conditions and repeatedly chew that which has already chewed. Their inclinations toward Kṛṣṇa are never aroused, either by the instructions of others, by their own efforts, or by a combination of both."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read the purport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In this verse the words <span class="Italic">matir na kṛṣṇe</span> refer to devotional service rendered to Kṛṣṇa. So-called politicians, erudite scholars and philosophers who read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> try to twist some meaning from it to suit their material purposes, but their misunderstandings of Kṛṣṇa will not yield them any profit. Because such politicians, philosophers and scholars are interested in using <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as a vehicle for adjusting things materially, for them constant thought of Kṛṣṇa, or Kṛṣṇa consciousness, is impossible (<span class="Italic">matir na kṛṣṇe</span>). As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti: [Bg. </span>18.55] only through devotional service can one understand Kṛṣṇa as He is. The so-called politicians and scholars think of Kṛṣṇa as fictitious. The politician says that his Kṛṣṇa is different from the Kṛṣṇa depicted in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Even though he accepts Kṛṣṇa and Rāma as the Supreme, he thinks of Rāma and Kṛṣṇa as impersonal because he has no idea of service to Kṛṣṇa. Thus his only business is <span class="Italic">punaḥ punaś carvita-carvaṇānām [SB </span>7.5.30]-chewing the chewed again and again. The aim of such politicians and academic scholars is to enjoy this material world with their bodily senses. Therefore it is clearly stated herein that those who are <span class="Italic">gṛha-vrata,</span> whose only aim is to live comfortably with the body in the material world, cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. The two expressions <span class="Italic">gṛha-vrata</span> and <span class="Italic">carvita-carvaṇānām</span> indicate that a materialistic person tries to enjoy sense gratification in different bodily forms, life after life, but is still unsatisfied. In the name of personalism, this ism or that ism, such persons always remain attached to the materialistic way of life. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>:</div>
<div class="Verse">bhogaiśvarya-prasaktānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tayāpahṛta-cetasām<br class="calibre2"/>vyavasāyātmikā buddhiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>samādhau na vidhīyate<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.44]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"In the minds of those who are too attached to sense enjoyment and material opulence, and who are bewildered by such things, the resolute determination for devotional service to the Supreme Lord does not take place." Those who are attached to material enjoyment cannot be fixed in devotional service to the Lord. They cannot understand Bhagavān, Kṛṣṇa, or His instruction, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Adānta-gobhir viśatāṁ tamisram: [SB </span>7.5.30] their path actually leads toward hellish life. As confirmed by Rsabhādeva, <span class="Italic">mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ: [SB </span>5.5.2] one must try to understand Kṛṣṇa by serving a devotee. The word <span class="Italic">mahat</span> refers to a devotee.</div>
<div class="Verse">mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha<br class="calibre2"/>daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>bhajanty ananya-manaso<br class="calibre2"/>jñātvā bhūtādim avyayam<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.13]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"O son of Prtha, those who are not deluded, the great souls, are under the protection of the divine nature. They are fully engaged in devotional service because they know Me as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, original and inexhaustible." (Bg. 9.13) A <span class="Italic">mahātmā</span> is one who is constantly engaged in devotional service, twenty-four hours a day. As explained in the following verses, unless one adheres to such a great personality, one cannot understand Kṛṣṇa. Hiranyakasipu wanted to know where Prahlāda had gotten this Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Who had taught him? Prahlāda sarcastically replied, "My dear father, persons like you never understand Kṛṣṇa. One can understand Kṛṣṇa only by serving a <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> a great soul. Those who try to adjust material conditions are said to be chewing the chewed. No one has been able to adjust material conditions, but life after life, generation after generation, people try and repeatedly fail. Unless one is properly trained by a <span class="Italic">mahat</span>-a <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> or unalloyed devotee of the Lord-there is no possibility of one's understanding Kṛṣṇa and His devotional service."</div>
