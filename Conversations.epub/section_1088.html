In the past and even today the leaders of the Hare Kṛṣṇa faith, as we understand, have been abducted, assaulted, and subjected to mental and physical abuse. We also understand that there are widespread pressures being applied to convince the media and the government that religious freedom should not include the choice to live by the tenets of the Hare Kṛṣṇa Hindu scriptures. We strongly feel all these developments to be objectionable to all freedom-loving people of this great country. We will appreciate if you please look into this matter and take the needed steps to halt such religious suppression. Signed, V.J.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Some other statements by... There's a nice letter from one of the devotees to one important psychiatrist outlining our case. He does a very good job. Would you like to hear it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> "Dear Dr. Lubin: In our recent telephone conversation you asked me to articulate in a letter those questions concerning the current brainwashing, deprogramming controversy which I feel may be pertinent to psychiatrists interested in religious issues and therefore a potential topic for discussion and or research within the Committee on Psychiatry and Religion of the Group for Advancement of Psychiatry. Speaking on my own behalf and informally on behalf of the Hare Kṛṣṇa religious society, I might suggest that this issue raises some very serious questions concerning possible abuses of diagnostic power in psychiatry against religious practitioners and movements for what may be social, political, and legal ends. Within the last ten years a large number of new religious groups, sects, communities and organizations have appeared on the American scene. Some are totally new organizationally as well as theologically. And others are, or allege to be, based upon some already existing spiritual tradition. I myself am a member for six years of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, the Hare Kṛṣṇa Movement. The term Kṛṣṇa consciousness is synonymous with the term <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> a theistic form of yoga which finds its scriptural authority in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and other major Indian devotional texts. The religious tradition represented in the West of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, Vaiṣṇavism, has centered the lives of hundreds of millions of Hindus for many centuries in India. This particular tradition has produced one of the world's largest and richest bodies of religious, philosophical, and mystical literature. The founder and spiritual leader of the movement, A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupāda, has within the last ten years, offered more than fifty volumes of translation and commentary on major texts of the tradition: <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Śrī Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> etc. These works are considered significant contributions to scholarship by specialists in the field and are studied in the universities throughout the world. See book reviews in the pamphlet, 'The Kṛṣṇa Consciousness Movement is Authorized.' The members of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement, both men and women, single and married, live in strict adherence to Vedic and Vaiṣṇava principles in regards to religious practice, chastity vows, diet, etc. The movement's nearly one hundred centers are mostly urban monasteries from which members in accordance with Vaiṣṇava tradition perform evangelistic and proselytizing activities. The authenticity of the Hare Kṛṣṇa movement has formerly been confirmed by numerous Hindu religious academic and cultural bodies both in India and U.S. Of the new religious movements which are prominent, most are allegedly based on either a Western religious tradition: the Children of God and Unification Church are Christian oriented; or an Eastern religious or philosophical tradition: Zen groups, yoga groups, Hare Kṛṣṇa, etc. Of the groups based either on Western or non-Western spiritual traditions, some are seen as not accurately representing that tradition upon which they are ostensibly based. For instance, several Christian church organizations assert that the Unification Church, the Moonies, is not a bona fide Christian organization. Others, such as the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, are accepted as legitimate, both by scholars and adherents of that tradition. As the public tends, however, to indiscriminately lump together whatever appears to be strange or out of the ordinary, the mass media refers to all such groups with the derogatory term, 'cult.' All questions of legitimacy aside, the parents of many members of such groups feel, for one reason or another, that their son or daughter has been brainwashed and they are under the 'mind control' of the cult. Originally denoting the specific technique employed by Chinese Communists to effect ideological persuasion to extreme psychological and often physical coercion, the term brainwashing is defined as a colloquial term applied to any technique designed to manipulate human thought or action against the desired will or knowledge of the individual." That's from the Encyclopedia Britannica. "In popular usage it becomes an imprecise, all-encompassing and pejorative term used to describe any kind of persuasion or behavior with which one may disagree. In psychology it is not generally accepted, I am told, as a legitimate clinical term. How does one wash another's brain? The dynamics of 'conversion' in the case of Kṛṣṇa consciousness are quite informal. Talking with devotees, reading scripture, meditation, etc. and certainly do not include the application of any type of psychological coercion against the desire, will, or knowledge of the potential or novice devotee. Although life in a Hare Kṛṣṇa community is communal and monastic with well-defined guidelines affecting the behavior and religious practice, it is in fact, a good deal more open then many or most types of monastic communities. The Hare Kṛṣṇa member is totally free to increase or decrease his involvement with the Society at any time he or she wishes. Because full commitment, as in any religious tradition, is not easy. A high percentage of those who join eventually leave. If brainwashing is what we're doing, we're not very good at it. Distressed however by an apparent rejection of their own values and lifestyle, and unable to account for what may be radical or abrupt change in the lives of their offspring, some parents of cult members, believing that their sons and daughters have been brainwashed, hire someone like Ted Patrick to forcefully abduct and debrainwash or deprogram them. What is being called deprogramming involves extreme coercive tactics, including rather intense psychological and often physical intimidation aimed at inducing the cult member to renounce his or her religious beliefs and practices. (See affidavit enclosed.) During deprogramming the victim is isolated from his particular religious community and is physically restrained. His religious apparel and paraphernalia, scriptures, prayer beads, sacred pictures etc., may be confiscated and destroyed and his beliefs and religious convictions vilified. In one case a pregnant mother was physically beaten. In another, a Hare Kṛṣṇa devotee who refused to violate his religious vow of reciting names of God, had his mouth filled with ice and gagged. Such deprogramming lasts often for several weeks with deprogrammers working in shifts while the deprogrammee is deprived of sufficient sleep. All this so that the brainwashed youth can be returned to a normal state and once again be able to make free choices. Deprogramming often ends with the victim signing a statement admitting that he had been brainwashed. Perhaps just as the confessions of those accused of being witches during the Holy Inquisitions were proof of the existence of witchcraft, such confessions by members of religious groups are taken as sufficient proof of brainwashing by those committed to the idea of cultic brainwashing. But such tactics are a gross violation of fundamental human and constitutional rights..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To get the sun if you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> "But such tactics are a gross violation of fundamental human and constitutional rights are to go without saying. In cases where victims have instigated charges of kidnapping against parents and deprogrammers, grand juries have thus far refused to issue indictments apparently because the work is done at the behest of parents or other relatives and ostensibly for the good of the victim. The situation which has prompted me to communicate with members of the professional psychiatric community involves sweeping implications of a very important legal case which will be going to trial sometime in the late winter or early spring. Some background of the case may be helpful here." Then he explains about the case. Anyway, it's very nicely written. And he's mostly trying to expose that the psychiatrists have to take an objective standpoint. Otherwise, there are some psychiatrists who are atheistic and they are contending that any religious experience or so-called religious consciousness is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Artificial dependence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...artificial dependence, yeah. So this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that there is a tissue in the brain, they disturb with this religious idea. They say like that. And if that tissue is operated then there will be no more religion. They can do that. With a brain operation he'll forget willfully. These rascal, so-called scientists, they can do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There are some psychiatrists who are on our side though. So if we can rally their support... The whole thing is so emotional and based on this strong appeal by the scientists and leaders to avoid religion because of the distraction from sense gratification, that all of the charges against us are completely baseless. There's no foundation. And if we just carefully and with calculation expose all of their nonsense accusations, it will be a great victory. Especially now it has become such a national issue that the leaders of society have to become involved, otherwise they'll become implicated. They have to come out and say whether they support the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're supporting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They must support it. Actually, I'm sure that they're astonished to find out how intelligent all the devotees are. The devotees are the most intelligent people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa yei bhaje sei baḍa catura.</span> Then, what other letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's this conference which took place at Harvard, a symposium headed by Dr. Harvey Cox who is very important and a very famous theologian in America. Some of the things they said are very nice. Especially there's some quote from the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> that gives it... This is actually stated by this Mr. Cox, or Dr. Cox, a very important man. He gives a quote from the <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> "Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea and the great multitude from Galilee followed him. And many who had diseases pressed in upon him to touch him. And he went up into the hills and called to him those whom he desired and they came to him. And he appointed twelve to be with him and he sent them out to preach. And then he came to his home town and the crowd came together, so many of them that they could not even eat. And when his family heard about this they went out to seize him for they said, 'He is besides himself.' And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, 'He is possessed by Beelzebub and by the Prince of Demons.' And Jesus said to them, 'If the house is divided against itself, that house will fall. It surely will not be able to stand.' And then his mother and his brothers came and standing outside the house where he was, they sent a message in to him calling him. And the crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, 'Your mother and your brothers are outside and they are asking for you.' And Jesus replied, 'Who are my mother and my brothers?' And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, 'Here are my mother and my brothers. For whoever does the will of God is my brother and my sister, and my mother."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> All these... Kīrtanānanda Swami was there and a boy who was kidnapped, Vasu Gopāla, as well as Dr. Harvey Cox, the Civil Liberties Attorney who is defending us, and Dr. Stephen Corover, a psychologist, Jack Colley, who's a renowned religious scholar, and Dr. Eck, a lecturer in Sanskrit and India studies at Harvard. The public was invited and they had questions from the floor and all of the members of the panel, important people, were all in our support. It's very long...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's one interesting statement in there from one of these men. He's lived in Vṛndāvana for about two years. And he says how when he first went to Vṛndāvana, all the people there, they would chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma, but it was kind of a derogatory thing because they had seen this film, <span class="Italic">Dum-mada-dam.</span> So whenever they saw a Westerner they thought, "Oh, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma," implying, "Oh, you're a hippie, you're a drug addict." Like that. But he said in the last two or three years since we established our temple, now that is completely changed. They're still saying, "Hare Kṛṣṇa Hare Rāma," all the children shout it, but now they expect us to shout <span class="Italic">"Haribol"</span> back and that it's a sign of, it's a friendly gesture now. So he's an outsider, but he's noticed the change in the Indian people's attitude, especially in Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He said, "Any Westerner they see in Vṛndāvana they say Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Rāma."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah, and he points out how the people, they generally ask when they see a Westerner, they ask, "Oh, when is <span class="Italic">darśana</span> at your temple?" And he says that they're actually interested to come to our temple because the standard there is very much acceptable to them. They're attracted to come not because we're Westerners, but because they can see that our standard of worship is as good as or better than their own standards even.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Language does not make united. This Bangladesh, they speak Bengali. They write Bengali. But why they are separate? America and England, they speak the same language. Why Washington declared independence? Australia, they have also declared independence from England just a piece of land. So there cannot be unity on any platform unless there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. It is impossible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness is the only thing that encompasses everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is false idea that by language, linguistic unity there will be... There are so many different examples.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can change immediately. <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> You can change immediately within a second.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says... You are taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the leader is taking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and he's speaking nonsense. So we are human beings, we should know what Kṛṣṇa says. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">paramparā,</span> whether he's speaking <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> or he's speaking whimsically. That much sense we must have. Otherwise, I am the same sheep. Then why you are speaking which is not in the <span class="Italic">paramparā?</span> at least, you should be... Now this movement is started, because on this principle, That why these rascals are speaking not in the <span class="Italic">paramparā?</span> That is my seed of starting this movement. I must start the movement. That is the impetus of this movement, that they must speak according to the <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> And someone allowed them to speak otherwise. Therefore I wrote this book, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span> Don't make interpretations. And by the grace of Kṛṣṇa it has become to some extent successful. That is the impetus. Why they should talk nonsense? It is clear that <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Paramparā</span> means... That is also explained.</div>

Even Caitanya Mahāprabhu did not refuse, but women used to offer their respect from little distance, not very near. That was Caitanya Mahāprabhu's restriction. But in our association there is no such thing as refusing anyone the opportunity. Kṛṣṇa does not say. <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ striyaḥ śūdrās tathā vaiśyāḥ</span> [Bg. 9.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> He does not make any...

He has to go to the householder, "Mataji, a <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi lijiye.</span>"(?) Or he'll stand. Generally woman comes to give <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span> So how it is possible to restrict the eyes? That is, he does not...I think I cannot accept this, that Rūpa Gosvāmī refused.

You are from the frontier, so you must be eating meat and eggs. So we'll not give you our house." So ultimately, one of his business friends, because he was the manager of the office after a month or so, one of the business friends he said, "All right, I'll get you a house if you give a written undertaking that you'll not eat meat." So he said, "Okay, thank you. I'll write undertaking that I'll not eat meat." One year passed. But when he used to come back from office, in front of a particular shop he used to see... In those days even a crowd of twenty persons in front of a shop was a big thing. So he would see ten, fifteen people and eat what is stop in a shop and take a small tiffin box, drop off a small tiffin box and walk away. So one day he also stopped there and he asked the shopwala for this tiffin box. "What you are giving in there?" "That," he said, "is not for you." "What is this?" He said "It's not for you. You'll not get it." Then he visited that fellow five, six times, then ultimately, that man said, "Look here, why you want to know all about that? It's not meant for you, and you'll not be able to use it." He said, "What is, can you tell me." Then he brought it, gave it to him, he opened it. It was minced meat. "But it's meat." How do you know it is meat?" He said, "I have been living in Punjab for all of my life. I know what is meat." He said, "Now don't shout. Go away from here. They are my customers." "They are your customers? They are the very people who have been refusing me a house!" The same people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Meat-eating is now world wide. I have seen now in the airplane one Marwari gentlemen, he was eating the intestines of the (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Not one. In our relationships, not one. They are competing with each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> What is the motivation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have learned it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, no. Fashion. Now one thing is they can hold off the rich people in India. That is not now, but about, put it back to 1944-45, during the war time. British time. That hold has become stronger. If we do not eat West, particularly America, then we are called "uncivilized." So to prove that I am civilized, there are three things. I must speak English, my children must go to missionary or convent schools, we must adopt Western customs and etiquette, and we must adopt their eating habits. Now if I'm not accepted in the American society... Even the British is now called uncivilized comparatively. If I'm not accepted by the Americans, that, "Yes, I know the standards and I live like them or even better than them," then I am supposed to be common. This is the conception of civilization amongst the Marwaris and the Gujaratis of the richer class. Previously it used to be, as they say of ancient India, that if one did not speak Sanskrit he was supposed to be uncivilized. So now that has come out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our childhood, my father's generation, in Calcutta, if a gentleman does not keep a prostitute extra, he is not a respectable man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That was in Delhi? That was during the Mogul time in Delhi? Even after the Mogul time? Not only keeping. In Delhi one of my very, my father's very close friend, Lala Sriram from Delhi...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, Sriram is a famous man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, not that millionaire. Another Sriram. And they were from Delhi. Just I'm talking only about 1939-40. In Karachi he came. He said every boy, before marriage, his marriage, he was supposed to go and take training from a prostitute for a month or so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> If a boy was not trained there he could not find a good wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That was a part of his qualification to get a good wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now how is this (indistinct) because the bride and bridegroom is selected by the parents.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes, the parents would not select that boy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Because parents, as they inquire today, how much you are educated, that was one of the qualifications.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> (laughs) I don't know. But to learn all these etiquettes of methods when you are in a <span class="Italic">sabhā</span> (indistinct) these cabarets and all the... That type of cabaret, how you should behave?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We will leave at 7:25, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. What is the time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fifteen, twenty minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What will be about the light?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are fixing it up now. I don't know why it goes out. I've told the construction department to look into it, to fix it. I don't know why it goes out again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In our area only?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just here, the top floor of this building. Just your apartment and the next apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Other buildings, they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, yes. Even our buildings other side have it. Just this one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Some emergency light needs to be connected here, so automatically the light goes out (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Vṛndāvana they have got that generator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> That is very good but (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't need it in Bombay because in Bombay it never goes off. I think it's going off because something is wrong with the wiring in this apartment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Otherwise, there's no reason. On our side it doesn't go out at all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Vṛndāvana it takes only two minutes to change. Similarly, we have in Māyāpura also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> So can I know the reason why you are restraining the use of <span class="Italic">gobar</span> gas now. I could not understand actual technical difficulty. Is there any difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we can utilize the <span class="Italic">gobar</span> in different way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but <span class="Italic">gobar</span> gas is not good, that's why...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not good. But we have to arrange for this plant, generate gas. So why not direct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No, but the fuel is achieved, but the fertilizer is lost. <span class="Italic">Gobar,</span> there are two elements. One is a methane gas and one is fertilizer. If you burn it you are burning the fertilizer which is very, very important, and very, very useful against the fuel that we get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that ash is very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No ash is not the full fertilizer. It is only partial. 10% of the fertilizer becomes ash. The organic matter is burned with great loss to the society and the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But in our Māyāpura, that plant, we spent so much, it has not become successful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> No that is mechanical fault. Just like electricity now it has failed. Now sir, we should not stop utilizing electricity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, any machine, that defect will be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> But that we have been working for twenty years in Ahmedabad. Everybody is very happy there, and they're actually making money out of it. The fertilizer that is there is about four times what is normally achieved. So good maintenance are required for any...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (sneezes loud) I have no objection, but I've got experience. In Māyāpura it is failure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Sometimes we get a defective machine. I purchased one for my girl's house. I've got a number of about 30. But one was rejected but...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Either defective machine or defective maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maybe. But the difficulty is there. (sneezes) (pause)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Railway may be going, but even that will be zigzag.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simla, er, Darjeeling is not so zigzag but big, big loops (?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Loops are big. Roads are very difficult. Kodekana there is no train. In Ootacamund there is a train.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You want Jagadīśa or Hari-śauri?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone. He can take this.</div>
