<div class="Heading">Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>with Governor<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>April 20, 1975, Vṛndāvana</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that everyone is doing his own duty. Never mind if you are Christian or if you are a Muslim or Hindu, that, what is your duty, what is said in your scripture, you must do it. Not that "Because it is secular, I can do whatever I like."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> Secular means I respect you, not only I am Hindu or do what I do...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Secular means impartial.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> But also not come in the way of a Muslim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no need. Secular means government's duty is that "You call yourself a Hindu. Whether you are acting as Hindu? You call yourself as Muslim. Whether you are acting as Muslim?" This is government's duty. Government does not say or prefer that "You are Christian. It is not good. You become Hindu." No, that is not government's... You remain your Christian, but government's duty is that whether he is acting as Christian. This is government's duty. Not that you are acting like a something else, and you are calling yourself Christian. You are acting like a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and you are advertising yourself as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> So just like a, what is called, quack. If he writes, "Dr. something," that is punishable. But you are quack. That's all right. You can take a certificate that you have got some experience. The registered medical practitioner, I think that is... But what is this, that you are proclaiming yourself as a... (chuckles) So character means a class of men there must be, maybe very few, but they are actually men of character. Just like I am teaching them no illicit sex, no meat-eating, no gambling, no intoxication. This is basic principle. Otherwise, where is his character? You are doing all nonsense, and still, you are proclaiming yourself as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> This should be stopped. And a training college should be there how to make a real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> I have given the example...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> <span class="Italic">Vānaprastha</span> college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vānaprastha</span> college, yes. That is the very essential thing at the present moment, that a class of men... Just like the same example: If one wants to become an engineer he must be properly trained up. If he wants to become a medical man he must be properly trained up. Similarly, if one wants to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then he must be properly trained up, or even if one does not want, the state should maintain a college where a real <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is trained up. Just like Sir Ashutosh Mukherjee, when he opened some higher studies of academic qualification, so there was one or two students, and there were three professors drawing at least twelve hundred rupees per month. So twelve hundred rupees per month, that means thirty-six hundred, expenditure, and the income is thirty-six rupees. It is not the question of money, but it is the question of culture. So even though at the present moment people are not inclined to become a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> I tried it. I tried it before starting this movement. I tried to some friends that "You have got four sons. Give me one son. I shall train him how to become a perfect <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span>" Nobody agreed. They said, "Swamiji, (Hindi)," But if there is not a ideal class of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> then how you can say that you become moralist? If there is no example of moralist, how you can ask people, "Become moralist"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> The thing is a very intensive and completely dedicated course on making an individual a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> (indistinct)... Then the second thing is not that intensively, but in a village (indistinct) all people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> No, all people... One or two could be taken out of many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I asked him. Actually the idea is in the society as it is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> The <span class="Italic">guṇas</span> are there. Just like naturally one is taking education just to become a politician, one is taking education how to become a high character saintly person. That natural inclination is already there, but that is not being properly harnessed. Therefore a regular educational institution should be there where proper training of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> proper training of <span class="Italic">kṣatriya, vaiśya,</span> must be given. These four divisions must remain there. And the, so far the brahminical culture, that must be there. Otherwise you cannot say that you become moralist. Where is the example of moralist? A section of person must be there, fully moralist. That ideal section is now lacking. Therefore, what I have written, that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "As there are different sections of educational institutions, there must be one institution how to train up perfect <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> with ideal characters as above mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> If there is a section of people of ideal character, say 5 percent, the other 95 percent, by seeing their example, will follow. In other words, a section of the society must be of ideal character. That is essential."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So therefore this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college is very essential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> Both intensive and extensive training.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Proper training. It may be extensive and intensive... Doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> You said 5 percent and 95 percent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ninety-five percent may remain non<span class="Italic">-brāhmaṇa.</span> But this 5 percent, if they are strongly brahminical, then others will follow. <span class="Italic">Ekaś candras tamo hanti na ca tārāḥ-sahasraśaḥ.</span> You have got millions of stars. Nobody cares for them. But people are looking after "When the moon will rise? When the moon will rise?" That one moon is sufficient than millions of stars. So this is the suggestion. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "The propagation of <span class="Italic">mānava-dharma.</span> Regarding propagation of <span class="Italic">mānava-dharma, mānava-dharma</span> means the activities of the human beings. So the distinction between <span class="Italic">mānava-dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">paśu-dharma</span> is that in the animal society there is no idea of God consciousness. God consciousness can only be propagated in human society. In the animal society they may be physically stronger than the humans like the tiger and the elephant or many such animals, but they cannot be educated spiritually."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may be very strong, our tiger and elephant, but they have no capacity to accept any education. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "But in human society, even though one may be a low-grade member of the society, he can be trained up to be purified as a first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> It only requires training. Therefore, <span class="Italic">manava-dharma</span> means to impregnate a human being with spiritual knowledge. A human being must be educated spiritually. That means he must know that he is not this body. Kṛṣṇa teaches this idea in the beginning of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span></div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the beginning of spiritual education, that every one of us is not this body. Unfortunately the whole world is in darkness, and therefore every human is identifying with this body and thinking wrongly, 'I am Indian,' 'I am American,' 'I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>' 'I am this,' 'I am that.' To drive away this misconception of life is actually <span class="Italic">manava-dharma.</span> We must know that we are not this body but spirit soul, and as such, we are part and parcel of God and therefore qualitatively one with God, exactly like a small particle of gold is also gold as is the gold from the big gold mine. But quantitatively the particle of gold is not equal to the gold in the mine. This is very elaborately described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> and if we accept these principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as <span class="Italic">manava-dharma,</span> then the whole world will appreciate. And this is being done by our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Point Five: Elements in our tradition relating to <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">saṁsṛti</span> which are useful and wholesome but which are being discarded in practice, and those which may be considered to be unsuitable in the present times. Number Five: Regarding elements in our tradition relating to <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">saṁsṛti..."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This kind of understanding at the present time, at the present time... (Hindi) So we give reference, that "Present time, everyone is fallen." But truth is always the same, not at present time. So the real truth is that ideal man of character there must be. Because at the present moment there is no character, there is no moral education, therefore we have to adapt according to them, no. The <span class="Italic">pukka</span> moralist, he must be moralist. It doesn't matter that "People at the present time, they do all immoral activities; therefore we have to adjust." No. Strictly one should be moralist. There is no question of present time or past time. That should be real point of view. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Regarding the elements in our tradition relating to <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and <span class="Italic">saṁsṛti,</span> we must adopt the whole <span class="Italic">varṇa</span> and <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> as they are recommended in all the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> If you give up these directions of the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> that is neither <span class="Italic">dharma</span> nor <span class="Italic">saṁsṛti,</span> at least in the Indian tradition, as it is directed in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that the four divisions of social and the four divisions of religious systems like <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra, brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span> and <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> must be adopted. Otherwise there is no tradition of <span class="Italic">bhāratīya sanskṛiti."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you give up this <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> then where is your <span class="Italic">bhāratīya sanskṛiti?</span> But they are trying to give it up, abolish this. Then where is <span class="Italic">bhāratīya sanskṛiti?</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Six: Injunctions of <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> regarding charity and how it should be practiced in the present conditions. So the mutual relationship of <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and politics in the light of our history and tradition can only be revived when we observe the system of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama.</span> It is actually like this: the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is like the head, and the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> is like the arms, the <span class="Italic">vaiśya</span> is the stomach or the abdomen, and the <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is like the legs. Similarly, spiritually, the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is the trained-up disciple, the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> is the trained-up householder, the <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> is experienced as a retired gentleman, and the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> is completely in the renounced order of life for spiritual advancement. There is no question of the head being in an exalted position without the cooperation of the leg. When there is a pin-prick in some part of the leg, the head immediately takes it very seriously and takes out the thorn in some part of the leg. Similarly, whenever there is some outside attack, the arms or the hands spread to protect the whole body. In the same way, within the abdomen there is the machinery of digesting foodstuffs, and after digestion the secretion turns into blood and it is infused throughout the whole anatomical structure of the body. Similarly, the cooperation between the head, arms, stomach and legs is the perfect situation of the human society."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> Coordination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Coordination. As head is also trying to maintain the body nicely, this arm is also. Now this has been nationally centralized. So that is the idea. Not that "Because I am head, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> oh, here is a <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> Oh, don't see his face." Why? <span class="Italic">Śūdra</span> is also required. Leg is also required. Head is also required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> It is an harmonious coordination.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, harmonious coordination. But the <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> were hated like anything, and they became Mohammedans. And there was no reacceptance. Formerly, from Caitanya literature we understand, that if the Musselman will take little water from the <span class="Italic">badna</span> (?) and sprinkle like this, then you become Mohammedan. In this way all these Indians, they became Mohammedan. And the result is now the Pakistan, and you go on fighting forever. Why these innocent persons who were by sprinkling water became Mohammedan, why they do not claim? Kṛṣṇa and the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> it does not say that if one has fallen, you cannot reclaim him. No, why not reclaim him? <span class="Italic">Māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa...</span> [Bg. 9.32]. This is by birth. And of course, in our country everything was taken by birth. Now it is going on. But even by birth one is low-grade...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> No, birth also was built up by a tradition. They were brought up in that atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It doesn't matter. But if he wants to be elevated, he should be given chance. That is the verdict of all <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> Now we are feeling, India, this difficulty. Because they are Europeans, Americans, the so-called big societies, they are not agreeable to accept them. You see? Although <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> does not say so. <span class="Italic">Śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya ye 'pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ.</span> "If one takes shelter of Me, even he is born in <span class="Italic">pāpa-yoni"... Striyaḥ vaiśyās tathā..., te 'pi yānti parāṁ gatim,</span> "they can also be elevated to the highest exalted position." And in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> it is, many places it is said that a low-born person can be elevated. <span class="Italic">Caṇḍalo 'pi dvija śreṣṭho hari-bhakti-parāyaṇaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> We have right example of Vālmīki.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, Vālmīki. There were many. There were, are many. Nārada. Nārada was a son of a maidservant, <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> He had no father. So <span class="Italic">dāsī-putra.</span> And he became Nārada. So where is the restriction? Similarly, in the <span class="Italic">Jabalopaniṣad,</span> Satyakāma Jabala, he was also a prostitute's son. And he approached Gautama Muni, "You kindly make me your disciple." Gautama Muni said, "What you are?" "I am my mother's son, that's all." "Then who is your father?" "That I do not know." "Ask your mother." So mother replied, "My dear son, I do not know who is your father." And he came and said to Gautama Muni, "Sir, my mother also does not know who is my father." Then Gautama Muni said, "Yes, you are <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Come on. I shall..." Because speaking truth. So unless you are a son of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> you cannot speak such secret truth. Nobody will say that "I do not know who is my father." It is social scandal even up to date. But he plainly said that "My mother does not know who is my father." So immediately Gautama Muni accepted him as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa:</span> "You are telling the truth." <span class="Italic">Satya śamaḥ damaḥ.</span> Because it is first qualification. So such a high cultural life. Now we should take standard <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> and follow and establish educational institution to train them. Otherwise, simply by crying in the wilderness, what will be the result? Now some result is there because I am practically training them. And before me, all the swamis went there. They lectured, that's all. So what is the meaning of lectures unless you train them? That "Our Hindu religion is very great, very nice, and whatever you like, you can do. It doesn't matter." Then where is the training? Now little effect is there because I am training them. As soon as one comes to me for becoming disciple, I place before him that "You have to give up all these habits." When he agrees, then I accept him. And therefore I have got some selected, trained-up men. So there must be this training college, institution, and proper training according to the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Then there is possibility of changing the whole situation. Then what is next?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "The injunctions of <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> regarding charity and how it should be practiced in the present conditions. The injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> about charity is that charity should be given to qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> because they will spend it for the benefit of the whole human society. This is called charity in goodness. In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> there..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we are getting charity, crores of rupees, but we are spending for this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, not for drinking. And if charity is given to a drunkard, what he will do? He will drink only. Therefore charity is recommended to be given to the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> no other else. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> The <span class="Italic">apatra-dana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? <span class="Italic">Apatra-dana,</span> that is third-class. Go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "This is called charity in goodness. In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> there is no recommendation for giving charity to the unqualified men. In this connection I am enclosing a copy of one chart reproduced in our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead,</span> 'Charity in ignorance.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She has written one article in our <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span> I am quoting from that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "...in ignorance performed at an improper time and place to an unworthy person like a gambler or a drunkard, or contemptuously, without respect. Charity in passion, performed to get something in return with a desire for fruitive results or in a grudging mood. Charity in goodness, performed as a duty and at the proper time and place to a worthy person and with no expectation of material returns. And charity in pure goodness, performed only to satisfy the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> charity in passion and ignorance is completely rejected, although people do it unconsciously. Charity in goodness only is recommended. Point Eight: Proper and beneficial use of the income and property of the institutions and how far the policies of the government and the exercise of its authority in its behalf are just and proper. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī was the chief minister of the government of Nawab Hussein Shah. He gave us a good example how to divide the property in the society. Fifty percent of the income must be spent for Kṛṣṇa, twenty-five percent of the income should be spent for family, and twenty-five percent should be kept in reserve for emergency expenditure. Spending fifty percent of the income for Kṛṣṇa means for the whole society by encouraging the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Point Nine: The role of <span class="Italic">manava-dharma pariṣat.</span> I think that if the <span class="Italic">manava-dharma pariṣat</span> takes these suggestions of mine very seriously, certainly it will be of great benefit to the Indians and the whole world. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is going on on this principle, and if the <span class="Italic">pariṣat</span> inaugurated by you cooperates with us, certainly we can render a very great service to the human society. So far <span class="Italic">manava-dharma</span> is concerned, it should not be restricted within the Indian borders, because human beings are in all parts of the world. Point Ten: The <span class="Italic">manava-dharma</span> mission, its constitution and program. Therefore the constitution of <span class="Italic">manava-dharma</span> or the institution of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> must be interesting for the whole world, and it should be exemplified by practical demonstration. The immediate program should be village organization as Mahatma Gandhi contemplated. In India the majority of the population is in the villages. The difficulty is that there is no sufficient supply of water to produce food grains. Mother nature, or mother Durgā, punishes the godless demons by restricting the supply of food grains. The godless demons are very enthusiastic to produce motorcars, skyscrapers, brothels, and cinemas, and many unnecessary demands of the body, but they are not interested in producing food grains. This is the defect of the modern society. If food grains are produced in an organized way, human society can produce ten times what they are presently producing. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is confirmed,</div>
<div class="Verse">annād-bhavanti bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>parjanyād anna-sambhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>yajñād bhavati parjanyo<br class="calibre2"/>yajñaḥ karma-samudbhavaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>3.14]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">I hope you will give your serious consideration to my suggestions, and I am prepared to cooperate with you to my best capacity if you think my suggestions are right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This suggestion is to you also. (chuckles) And if you can do these things organizedly, certainly it will be beneficial to the whole human society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> Any elaboration of what you refer to as <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> college?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama. Vānaprastha,</span> just like we have got this building. Now, if somebody retires and engages himself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, they are welcome. They can take <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> and stay here. It is not possible at the present moment that gentleman will live in the forest. That is not possible. Then here is a place, Vṛndāvana, holy place. We have constructed this building, and people should take <span class="Italic">vānaprastha,</span> or retirement, and may come here and live peacefully and cultivate spiritual knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> I think the governor was asking about the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Varnāśrama</span> college, that training factual <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> And the government should be, as I explained to you, that if one is proclaiming himself as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he must act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> If one is proclaiming as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> he must act as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Otherwise, there will be no restriction, and a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> will claim to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That will create a disturbing situation. In Pṛthu Mahārāja's time it was strictly prohibited that... That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, sva-dharme nidhanaṁ śreyaḥ para-dharmo bhayāvahaḥ.</span> So if one is claiming to be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> he must be <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> That is another way of reforming the society. And nowadays everyone is a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and somebody is claiming, "I am <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span>" "I am <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span>" "I am this," "I am that." Formerly the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> (were) strictly following. They would not accept... In the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> it is said that the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in bad time may become a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> Just like Dronācārya. He was <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he became a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> for certain reason, and acting like <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> although he was respected as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he was acting as a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> So it is advised that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> may take the profession of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> and up to the <span class="Italic">vaiśya.</span> But if he takes the profession of a <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> then he is fallen. Then he is fallen. So this cultural institution should now be introduced. And the other countries, they are still respectful to the Indian culture. That's a fact. I have studied. So if we keep ourself in our, what he has mentioned, <span class="Italic">samsriti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāratīya samskriti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhāratīya samskriti.</span> It will be very respectfully accepted. Why should we imitate them? That is... Western civilization is not brahminical culture. There is no brahminical culture. And brahminical culture is needed. That is the head. That is the brain. And a little bit of this brahminical culture, because I am distributing and they are accepting it so nicely... So in our India, in a place like Vṛndāvana, Naimisaranya, like that, many people will come, if <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> college is established. Of course, we, in India, so far I know, nobody will come to be trained up as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> They will prefer to be trained up as an electrician and not as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Our Bon Mahārāja, he also tried for a Vaiṣṇava University. He was unsuccessful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> No, we take this electrician or engineer or an...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is already being taken. There are institution where electricians are trained up and motorist, they are... They have enough.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> No, what is... What is the... An electrician we get him. He is an electrician and also becoming a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> An engineer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, that cannot be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> You want completely a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, then there will be ideal character. That is going on. One man is claiming as <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but he is doing the work of electrician. That is already going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> No, but while doing his profession, if he has good influence of the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and then he will do the work with the dedication to God and to the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why you are suggesting that although he is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he become a electrician. Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> I will put it this way. He is an engineer, but I would also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Engineer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> A mechanical engineer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Governor:</span> And he also be influenced by the good points of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiḥ labhate naraḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is another way, that "I have no other means of earning livelihood." But if he becomes Kṛṣṇa conscious, then even though he is acting as an electrician, he is in touch with Kṛṣṇa. That is recommended in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> That I explained in the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> that even though leg is leg, it is not as important as the head. But the leg is also required to keep the body in healthy condition. So that electrician who has connection with Kṛṣṇa, he is no more electrician; he is Vaiṣṇava because he has got his relationship with Kṛṣṇa. So that is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya saṁsiddhiḥ labhate naraḥ.</span> You can get perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya.</span> S-v-a, <span class="Italic">sva.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya siddhiṁ vindati mānavaḥ [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> "By worship of the Lord, who is the source of all beings and who is all-pervading, man can, in the performance of his own duty, attain perfection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is there? What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "As stated in the Fifteenth Chapter, all living beings are fragmental parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord. As such, the Supreme Lord is the beginning of all living entities. It is confirmed in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra-janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> The Supreme Lord is therefore the beginning of life of every living entity. And the Supreme Lord, by His two energies, His external energy and internal energy, is all-pervading. Therefore one should worship the Supreme Lord with His energies. Generally the Vaiṣṇava devotees worship the Supreme Lord with His internal energy. His external energy is a perverted reflection of the internal energy. The external energy is a background, but the Supreme Lord, by the expansion of His plenary portion as Paramātmā, is situated everywhere. He is the Supersoul of demigods, all human beings, all animals, everywhere. One should therefore know that as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord it is his duty to render service unto the Supreme. Everyone should be engaged in devotional service to the Lord in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is recommended in this verse. Everyone should think that he is engaged in a particular type of occupation by Hṛṣīkeśa, the master of the senses. And, by the result of the work in which he is engaged, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, should be worshiped."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, he is electrician. If whatever he earns he engages in worship Kṛṣṇa, then he is transcendental. He is not electrician; he is a Vaiṣṇava. This is clearly said. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "If one thinks always in this way in full Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then, by the grace of the Lord, he becomes fully aware of everything. That is the perfection of life. The Lord says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, teṣām ahaṁ samuddhartā.</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 12.7] The Supreme Lord Himself takes charge of delivering such devotees. That is the highest perfection of life. In whatever occupation one may be engaged, if he serves the Supreme Lord, he will achieve the highest perfection."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, some of the big men, past politician like Nandaji, they are also thinking very nicely. Now it is the time to coordinate all these thinkers on the basis of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as we are pushing on this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. That should be seriously taken. And another difficulty is that without any reference to the <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> there are so many spiritual propagandist. That is not very good. That is not very good, not good at all. No question of very good. They are more or less atheist. They will not take, accept the instruction of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They'll manufacture their own way. That will not help us. You must take the standard things. Then it will be successful. In my, this propaganda, this Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I am very much satisfied that I did not adulterate any instruction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> And it is becoming very effective. And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also it is stated, <span class="Italic">yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Is that y-a?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Y-a-h. <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that verse. This index has been done by them. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya<br class="calibre2"/>vartate kāma-kārataḥ<br class="calibre2"/>na sa siddhim avāpnoti<br class="calibre2"/>na sukhaṁ na parāṁ gatim<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"But he who discards scriptural injunctions and acts according to his own whims attains neither perfection, nor happiness, nor the supreme destination." "As described before, the <span class="Italic">śāstra-vidhim,</span> or the direction of the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> is given to the different castes and orders of human society. Everyone is expected to follow these rules and regulations. If one does not follow them and acts whimsically according to his lust, greed, and desire, then he never will be perfect in his life. In other words, a man may theoretically know all these things, but if he does not apply them in his own life, then he is to be known as the lowest of mankind. In the human form of life, a living entity is expected to be sane and to follow the regulations given for elevating his life to the highest platform, but if he does not follow them, then he degrades himself. But even if he follows the rules and regulations and moral principles and ultimately does not come to the stage of understanding the Supreme Lord, then all his knowledge becomes spoiled. Therefore one should gradually raise himself to the platform of Kṛṣṇa consciousness and devotional service; it is then and there that he can attain the highest perfectional stage, not otherwise. The word <span class="Italic">kāma-kārataḥ</span> is very significant. A person who knowingly violates the rules acts in lust. He knows that this is forbidden, still he acts. This is called acting whimsically. He knows that this should be done, but still he does not do it; therefore he is called whimsical. Such persons are destined to be condemned by the Supreme Lord. Such persons cannot have the perfection which is meant for the human life. The human life is especially meant for purifying one's existence, and one who does not follow the rules and regulations cannot purify himself, nor can he attain to the real stage of happiness."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, arrangement is...? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
