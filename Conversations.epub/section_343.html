This is one defect. And another defect is <span class="Italic">ghnantaṁ go-mithunaṁ padā,</span> maintaining large-scale slaughterhouse. These are the two defects of modern civilization. They..., on the top of government there are <span class="Italic">śūdras,</span> not <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas.</span> Neither they are guided by intelligent class, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> Parīkṣit Mahārāja's first beginning is <span class="Italic">dvija-varya-śikṣayā.</span> The guidance was first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> and he was a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> first-class. And there was no animal slaughterhouse. They are also suffering. They are bringing every day some problem. "What is the solution of this problem, what is this solution...?" But why the problems are coming? Because the defect is there that the, on the head of the government there are <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> and they are busy in cow-killing, maintaining slaughterhouse. This is the defect. And they are not guided by the first-class, intelligent class of men. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> ...getting worse over these five thousand years, but by a reintroduction, reintroducing Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the tide can be turned in age of Kali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. That is the only remedy. That is the only remedy. Anyone who takes to this chanting of Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> he'll be cleansed of all sinful activities and then everything will come out nice. And it is practical. It is not story. Just see, all our disciples in Europe, America, they were habituated to so many bad habits, and because they are chanting, they are now cleansed. So it is small-scale. If you propagate it large-scale, everyone will be cleansed. [break] ...disciples who were trained up from very beginning of their life: meat-eating. They are giving meat-eating. Here in your country, small children, they are fed with meat-powder. Intoxication is also a daily affair. How they are giving up all intoxication? [break] Is there arrangement for... Where is Karandhara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya,</span> Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That placard, poster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Prajāpati and I discussed it yesterday and we're trying to find an artist to do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Nara-nārāyaṇa Prabhu's good wife is expert artist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> And she has... I guess she has agreed to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she is very nice, good artist. Give her engagement like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Maybe you could explain us a little more detail of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, with very much detail it will be cumbrous. You... Symbolic representation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Those three figures in the center?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> One is a devotee, one is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone is devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Yes, they are all three devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're engaged in three departments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> We were thinking for the administrator there could be a judge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Could be a judge, a high-court judge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means administrator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. The other one could be the president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, president also administrator. No, one is in the religious order. That is also required. But here we see, persons who are in religious order, they're also addicted to these four sinful, four sinful life. And he's presenting himself as religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> On the one should we depict meat-eating or animal slaughter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Should we depict animal-slaughter or meat-eating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Animal slaughter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will be still broader.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The three figures and one is in a suit, one... They all have <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> neck beads and bead bag...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Religious man may be in saffron color, a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> a <span class="Italic">tridaṇḍī sannyāsī.</span> Our Gurukṛpā Mahārāja? Where is he?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Gurukṛpā Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Here are religious men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> Oh! (laughter) <span class="Italic">Jaya!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> How will we distinguish between the other two men? They'll both be in suits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, the one man, the president, will be behind the presidential podium, presidential seal. In the front. And the other man would be a high-court judge with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> ...with black robes on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> With a, two balls.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make nicely this picture. Short-cut, at the same time very convincing. [break] Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> I'm very new to this Kṛṣṇa conscious movement and I'm not as firm as your devotees. Right now I'm being torn in half. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is so strong and I see so much of what you say. Is there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> Doubts.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your doubt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> Mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you want to continue it or stop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> Stop it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then stop it. Take instruction from the <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Don't speculate. That will not help you. The same example, a child's speculation, "Who is my father?" He will never be successful. But as soon as he asks his mother, "Who is my father?" Immediately knowledge: "Here is your father." Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> Association is very important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> Association.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One has to take information from the authority. That knowledge is perfect. And these rascals, philosophical, scientific speculation, all useless waste of time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> I live in Long Beach and I will be going to school soon, but I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. We don't accept any speculative knowledge. We want final conclusion of the experienced person. <span class="Italic">Nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ,</span> this word is used. <span class="Italic">Nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ,</span> it is concluded. <span class="Italic">Kavibhir nirūpitaḥ. Idaṁ hi puṁsas śrutas..., tapasaḥ śrutasya vā. Avicyuto 'rthaḥ kavibhir nirūpitaḥ. Nirṇītaḥ...</span> These words are... It is already concluded. There is no question of argument. In the Vedic literature, these words are used, <span class="Italic">nṛpa-nirṇītaḥ, nirūpitaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> I should abandon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nāsato vidyate bhāvo nā..., asataḥ vidyate bhāvaḥ.</span> What is the next line? So, we take things which is conclusive. The scientists, they are making experiment, where is the beginning of life. Misled. They are thinking life is from matter. They have no experience. Still, the rascal Darwin gave a theory. They are persisting on it. They have no practical experience that life is coming from matter. That is called <span class="Italic">vṛścika-taṇḍula-nyāya.</span> You have no experience in your country. We have got. Sometimes you'll find, scorpion is coming out from the stack of rice. You have seen it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I haven't seen it, but I have heard of the example.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So they are thinking the rice is..., rice is producing the scorpion. It is called <span class="Italic">taṇḍula-vṛścika-nyāya.</span> But rice cannot produce a life. The real fact is a scorpion lays down the egg within the rice, and by the fermentation it comes out. Just eggs. And the small creature comes out. And foolish creatures, they think it that the rice is producing scorpion. That is not possible. So they are putting forward this evolution theory that man is coming from monkey, but no monkey is producing a man. Nobody has seen. There are so many things. They put forward some theory, but it is not fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> The quickest way to knowledge...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quickest way to knowledge... That I told you; take the knowledge from the authority. The example I have already given that you cannot make research, search out who is your father. But if you go to the authority, mother, immediately you understand. This is the quickest way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">New Devotee:</span> The thing that's tearing me apart is, um...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But just try to understand this. The principle is that if you receive knowledge from the real authority, that is perfect and quick. And if with your imperfect senses you want to acquire knowledge by searching out, it will never be successful. The modern method is to search out the truth by their imperfect senses. All these scientists, philosophers, they are doing that. They admit that their senses are imperfect. Still, they are trying to go to the perfect by the imperfect senses. This is their defect. They are hoping that "Our imperfectness will be perfect by this research work." That is not possible. Imperfectness will remain ever imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> They glorify such imperfections, Śrīla Prabhupāda, by saying...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Unless they glorify their imperfection, how they can stand? (laughter) They have no standing. If they do not glorify, then they are proved rascals. There will be no argument. They'll have to accept that "we are rascals." Therefore they have to glorify. The glorifying society... That is mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> The glorifying society is consisting of ass, camel, hog, and what is the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dog. So we... <span class="Italic">śva-viḍ-varāhoṣṭra-kharaiḥ saṁstutaḥ puruṣaḥ paśuḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">SB </i>2.3.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are all ass, camels, dogs, like that and they are praising each other. "Oh, you have discovered this. Oh, how nice you are. (laughter) How nice you are." But we understand the praiser and the praised, both are dogs and cats. That's all. So we don't give any benefit. It is a mutual praising society of cats and dogs, so we don't give any benefit. Now, they can also accuse us in the same way, that "You are also the society of cats and dog, mutual praising society." So... Now, who will judge whether they are right or we are right? Who will judge? Eh? There must be some judgement. Everyone will say that "I am right." But who judges? There must be a judge, that through both side the lawyers is fighting, that "My case is right." Then who will give judgement? There must be one judge. So who is that judge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">śāstra, guru, sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. That is the judge. Therefore we quote from Vedic literatures. As soon as we speak something, immediately quote Vedic literature. That is the way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The trouble is there are so many phony gurus and <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> There are so many misrepresentations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because their folly is... They therefore do not take authority. Otherwise they'll be exposed. Yes. <span class="Italic">śāstra-cakṣusā. Yaḥ śāstra-vidhim utsṛjya vartate kāma-kārataḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 16.23]<span class="Italic">.</span> These are the injunctions. (dog barks) Yes, come on. We have got your punishment. So there is an argument: <span class="Italic">pala bonatu hoya</span> (?). "I'm not afraid of you. Although I'm, I'm going away, I'm not afraid of you. (laughter) Don't think that I am afraid of you." This is dog business. They'll go, "gow!" and go away, go away. They'll not come forward. Come on. (laughter) [break] Well, our every day is a New Year. <span class="Italic">Nava-navayauvana.</span> Our Kṛṣṇa consciousness is so nice, the more you advance, you see new year, new year. That's all. Nothing is old. People are seeing that they are simply chanting the old slogan, Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we are feeling new pleasure in every moment. Take any other chanting, you cannot chant more than few hours. But the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> we can chant perpetually. So unless there is new enlightenment, how we can do that? [break] You can preach here, and then we are starting on the..., by the fourteenth. We shall go together to India. Is that all right? What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Are you bringing your boys over there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> They're going separate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> If we go the other way it's cheaper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Through New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] I cannot go there. You see? As if three hundred miles away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> [break] We saw from the plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Forty-five minutes on the plane from Miami we saw the comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It was there for forty-five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, a bad sign...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> As big as the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How big?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Big as the sky. It was flashing for forty-five minutes, this big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Flashing in horizontal directions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The four or five first flashes were very, very big and regularly every thirty seconds it was big flash, bigger than lightning, brighter, very bright.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Very brilliant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One part like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Yes, very fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Across the sky, shooot, shooot, shooot. Very fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> About forty-five min..., we..., it was still going but the plane passed it and it stayed behind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uh, so, this is a bad sign. Constellation. According to astronomical calculations. Therefore we, we follow the astrology according to the constellation. The child born, everything has connection, the constellation of the star has influence on the child. So therefore the horoscope-maker takes the calculation of the constellation and then calculate what is his future. This <span class="Italic">dhūmaketu</span> is described in <span class="Italic">Daśāvatāra-stotra, dhūmaketum iva kim api karālam. Dhūmaketum iva. Dhūmaketum iva kim api karālam.</span> As soon as there is comet, there will be some disaster. Very great disaster. In our childhood we saw the comet, not this like. That was small comet. Still, the first world war was there declared. That we have seen in 1914.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> Halley's comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> I think they called it Halley's comet. Halley's comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the... You can expect at any moment disaster in this material world, but the comet is the sign that there will be some great disaster. It is... This material world, in every step there is disaster. <span class="Italic">Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadām [SB </span>10.14.58]<span class="Italic">.</span> But those who have taken shelter of Kṛṣṇa, the disaster is not meant for them. <span class="Italic">Samāśritā ye pada-pallava-plavam. Padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām.</span> So how big it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> Very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> It was very spectacular. Something like twenty miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twenty miles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> Maybe at least fifty, sixty miles the four, five first flashes, very big. Let's see. From this tree all the way to the end of this tennis court, all over the sky. Big white flashings. Like big huge incredible lightning. Then afterwards it decreased, and then regularly, every thirty, forty-five seconds, there was big lightning. Not lightning, big flashes. Very uncommon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The scientists say that it's eighty-three million miles long...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> The scientists, they say that it's 83 million miles long, the comet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 83 miles?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> 83 million miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The tail.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The tail is 83 million miles. It's going fast, very forward, so it's emitting a tail of gases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who is supplying the gas? (laughter) The Arabians?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> There's no shortage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> When it comes to doing the <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> there's no energy shortage for us. We have unlimited stock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> By presence of the comet, the atmosphere is also polluted. Last time, what I saw, it was like this. Round and then tail. It is like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurukṛpā:</span> A long streak. It was behind the clouds. There were many clouds, and you could see it through the clouds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the speed? If it is 83 million miles, very heavy thing, then the speed must be also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Well, the speed is very great. I don't know exactly what it is, but it's millions of miles per hour. Perhaps not millions of miles. Hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> There must be living entities then on the comet. Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes. Everywhere there are living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Scientists are very excited about the comet because they think that it's made of the primordial substance of the universe and they think they'll be able to find out some clue how the solar system was created by examining the comet with their telescopes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them talk all nonsense. We say in Bengali, <span class="Italic">pāgale ki nā bole, chāgale ki nā khāya.</span> The goat can eat everything, and a madman can speak anything. (laughter) <span class="Italic">Pāgale ki nā khāya..., pāgale ki nā bole, chāgale ki nā khāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Are the living entities on the comet, are they very demoniac or intelligent or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not necessarily demoniac. Two classes of men are always there: intelligent and demon. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> ...comet. They just discovered it one or two years ago. They said that if it ever passed by the earth before, it was the time of the dinosaurs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dinosaur?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Yes. Over fifty thousand years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) He cannot say what happened yesterday, and he's speaking fifty thousand years. Is there a statement in any <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> or his own statement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, that's by mathematical calculation of the trajectory and speed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, mathematics...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> It's going at a certain speed in a certain orbit. So they calculate that it would complete that orbit once every fifty to two hundred thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is there in astrology, astronomy. That is not discovery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> No, actually, one scientist just looked at a telescope and saw it coming. And that's what they call discovery. And of course, he got the comet named after him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> The scientist. His name was Kahotek. So he discovered it. So the comet is named after him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if it is mentioned elsewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> I'm sure he'll want to keep his claim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if... In some astrological book, if it is mentioned there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Scientists probably won't accept it. They think if they don't discover it, then it's not bona fide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Unless one of them discovers it in the book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> Ah. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> If one of them discovers it in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> then, oh, they'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Karandhara:</span> They say they've looked through all the old books and the old records and they haven't found any mention of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think in the Indian astronomical calendar there must be mention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara-nārāyaṇa:</span> [break] ...effect of comet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, generally we know when there is comet, there is very bad effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The comet doesn't really bring the bad effect. It simply is a symptom. Is that it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The comet doesn't bring the bad effect, it is a symptom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, yes, bring, bring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> It does bring it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Does such a comet affect consciousness as well as matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Comet is just like a planet. It is a vehicle carrying so many conscious beings. It is just like if some policeman all of a sudden comes before us, it is to be supposed that someone is criminal, he's searching. Like that. (end)</div>
