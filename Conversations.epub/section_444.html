<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ignorances. They have opined, they have given the opinion that children born between the ages of twenty years and thirty-six years, they are healthy. But we have got experience that children born even at..., in India, twelve, thirteen years, they were healthy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They were what, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The parents were twelve or thirteen. The children were healthy. But this magazine said that children are healthy if the parents are from twenty-one to thirty-six.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> you said that by the age of sixteen, a girl should be married, or twenty-four for a man. We were just reading that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the maximum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> We were just reading that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The point is that supposing this twenty to thirty-six years is nice age... For women. But before twenty years, she is sacked, and her health is broken. What she'll produce, children? Because this is... The girls, from twelve years, thirteen years, nowadays, they begin sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> That's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So before she reaches twenty years, twenty times she must have taken contraceptive method. And that means her health is ruined. What she'll produce? They are given in the schools, colleges, contraceptive tablets. And they are prohibiting, "Don't get child before twenty years." What is this nonsense? This is the difficulty. All rascals, they have taken leadership. Women should, should be allowed to beget children as soon as they're able. But as soon as the pregnancy is there, there should not be any sex life. They have got sex life in pregnancy also. So many things, we have... We can guide them all, all these rascals. From <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> we can guide them. Therefore immediately human society, a class of men who are fully conversant with the Vedic conclusion required to guide these rascals, socially, politically, in every respect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They say that they have made studies, Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They have made studies and that if a woman gives birth at the age less than twenty there are more chances that she die according to their statistics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Their statistics in the western world... Inductive knowledge is always imperfect. They have not seen in India. My wife gave birth at the age of fourteen years. She is still living. She is ten years younger than me. So sixty-eight, sixty-nine, she is. She gave birth child at the age of fourteen. In 1918 I was married, and 1921 she gave birth the child, my first son. And she was never unhealthy; neither she had to go to the hospital for maternity hell. Natural delivery of child. Hare Kṛṣṇa. This illicit sex, even with wife... If sex life is indulged after the period of menstruation, that is also illicit sex. There are so many rules and regulations about sex life in Vedic culture. That is real use of sex life. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> sex life, He says that <span class="Italic">dharmāviruddhaḥ kāmo 'smi.</span> "Sex life which is under regulative principle of the Vedic knowledge," Kṛṣṇa says, "I am that sex life. I am that sex life." And beyond that, that is illicit sex life. And yesterday I was reading that <span class="Italic">dharma...</span> When there is irreligious sex, then it increases <span class="Italic">varṇa-saṅkara,</span> unwanted population. So the modern civilization, they're letting loose the women for prostitution, and they want nice children. That is not possible. Why this park is kept like this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> It's more of a forest, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> But this is surprising. Generally, they cut.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> In Los Angeles, you were saying about the system of monogamy, how in this way most of the women are left unmarried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is prostitution. If a man... First of all, the problem is... That they do not know, that they should produce sufficient food grains. These, all these contraceptive methods, this and that, monogamy, they are trying for checking population. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The basic principle is to check population. Now, if they follow the Vedic principles, automatically the population is checked. Just like <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> So if the, both the boys and girls remain <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> then where is the unwanted population? Where is the question of this contraceptive method?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> No need.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No need. Then when the <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> is allowed to become <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> he can keep more than one wife if he's able to provide them nicely. Here they marry today and tomorrow divorce. The... No meaning of marriage. Simply prostitution. Because he does not need a wife. His sex life is satisfied in so many ways. So why he should be affected, attached to wife? And why the wife should be attached to the husband? Therefore divorce. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, Dam-patye ratim eva hi.</span> In the Kali-yuga, married life means sex life. For sex satisfaction, they'll marry. Otherwise, there is no need of marrying. That is... <span class="Italic">Svīkāra eva codvāhe.</span> Marriage means that they, both of them agree that "We shall live together for some time." These things are happening, already foretold. By agreement, "Yes, we shall live together." That is marriage. "And then I may divorce." Actually, they do not know what is the meaning of marriage. All dependent on sex. <span class="Italic">Rati. Rati</span> means... <span class="Italic">Dam-patye ratim eva hi. Vipratve sūtram eva hi:</span> "To become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> means just have a thread only."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Even big scientists and politicians, same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. It is a civilization of rascals. That's all. That <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina. Duṣkṛtina</span> means they have got merit. As human being, everyone has got merit. That is used for sinful activities. That's all. <span class="Italic">Duṣkṛtina.</span> Therefore they are godless. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> All these sinful men, rascals, they don't care for God. They don't care for next life. This is the position. They don't believe in these things. If they believe in these things, they'll have to be systematized. They don't want that. The life is, what is called, extravagancy? No? Now it is a... Systematically they are following. The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> they work hard, whole week, and the end of the weekend, they call any beautiful woman, pay her something, don't take responsibility of family life. This has become a system. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> This is why the women wish to have the same rights as the men because they're not being taken care of at home.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal life. (pause) What are these trees? Oak tree? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Yeah, oaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Some of them are oaks. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We can get out from this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Yes. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> ...Vedic culture, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if there was illicit sex going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In Vedic culture, what would King Parīkṣit do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't find any illicit sex. They were having more than one wife. So there was no question of illicit sex. If one wife is pregnant, then the man, he goes to another wife. Man has got that tendency. So as soon as she is pregnant, she is kept separate. Even we have seen. When the girl is pregnant, she goes to her mother's care, does not live with the husband. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Off in the distance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A girl is pregnant, suppose, then, during her pregnancy period, ten months, there is no sex, and unless the child becomes six months old, there is no sex. The thing is that in the modern world, sex life has become the only pleasure. They do not know anything else. Therefore everything is discredited. And another thing is they are afraid of keeping more than one wife for population. But if they produce sufficient food, where is the question of overpopulation? Another thing they have made, especially in the western world, they don't want to produce food because they know, "We shall kill one animal and eat. Why take so much trouble? Let me increase industry, and I shall push my button. Money will come. And the slaughterhouse there. We shall eat." So they are getting money. By money, they are getting women to the choice. They are getting food, meat, and they're enjoying drinking. So money has become the whole thing. "Bring money some way or other and enjoy." This is the purport of civilization. They do not care what is God, that human body is meant for God realization. They have no such ideas. "There is nothing after death. So so long I am living, let me enjoy by the tongue, by the genital and by the belly. Use the tongue for eating anything which is palatable, which I like. Never mind what it is. And then genital also. Bring as many women..." This is civilization, modern. There is no question of sinful life or pious life, next life. (laughs) Another, their theory is that only on this planet there is living entities... [break] If there is sufficient rain in the desert, it will be also hot. [break] ...tells us in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> how to live comfortably and advance in spiritual life. And they should give advice to others. That is the business of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau. Nānā-śāstra-vicāraṇaika-nipuṇau sad-dharma-saṁsthāpakau. Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau tri-bhuvane mānyau śaraṇyākarau.</span> This is the description of the Gosvāmīs. They are well versed in all different types of Vedic scriptures just to establish a peaceful society <span class="Italic">sad-dharma,</span> very nice gentleman, peaceful society. <span class="Italic">Lokānāṁ hita-kāriṇau,</span> for the benefit of the whole human society. Therefore they are honored all over the world. This is <span class="Italic">gosvāmī</span> business, not to exploit (indistinct) live like irresponsible man, eat, drink, be merry and enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, their philosophy is that this is all there is, this life. After death, it's finished. And so they're trying to enjoy, enjoy, enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So if they have information that this is not the only life, then won't they automatically become more austere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (indistinct) consider what kind of life I'm going to get. (indistinct) They have made their own rascal philosophy that there is no life after death. Although they're experiencing that I am changing my body in this duration of life. I know that I have a child's body, child's body. That body's finished. Still I'm existing. So why I shall not exist after this body's finished? Where is the logic? Where is the... The simple logic they cannot understand. So dull brain. And they're advanced in civilization, big, big professor, big, big Indologist, this logic. The simple reason they cannot understand. What did they say? You have talked to many men about this logic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> About life after death?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They say it doesn't go beyond... They have to agree that the baby's body is gone and the young man's body is gone. They have to agree. But they say that that doesn't mean logically that I have to take another body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the other logic? If you have changed your body so many times, why not change this body? What is your reason? Natural course it should be that I have changed so many bodies so this body I shall change. This is natural logic. And what is his logic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> So he said... They say it may be or it may not be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is your rascaldom. But this is the real logic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They also say that it is not... It is the same body, more or less...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> But it is just developed, but it is not a different body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Developed means different body. Development means different body. They cannot say it is not different body. Then if it is not different, then go to childhood again. That means they're not human being. Human being means with logic. According to their definition, man is rational animal. They're not even rational. Like cats and dogs. There is no rationality. Cats and dogs also they have got rationality. Logic plus authority, Kṛṣṇa says. How you can deny? That means they don't agree with Kṛṣṇa's instruction. You see? This logic, I am not giving this logic. This logic is given by Kṛṣṇa. So unless... The difficulty is that unless they accept the authority, it is very difficult. Logic is there. The authority is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They feel, Prabhupāda, that they've been cheated so much by so many philosophies that when we say that the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are written by a person who's not contaminated by the modes of nature, they say, "Well, how is this possible? My experience is that everyone who's written books, they're all materialistic and therefore the philosophy must be like that."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must be following some philosophy. You're not without philosophy. Even the hippies they're also follow... They've got their own philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot give up philosophy. Now it is misfortune that you met with the cheaters. So make your fortune now. Believe in Kṛṣṇa's philosophy. Then you'll be happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That argument that we don't believe... But you're believing in Lenin's philosophy, the communist. And what is this hippies, their philosophy, Allen Ginsberg's philosophy? Ha? Debauch number one. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Ultimately, they don't follow anyone, although they may like people, they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say our only...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they are manufacture their own philosophy. Philosophy there must be. They've become their own authority. That is a chaotic condition. Authority he has made himself. Yes. I am my authority. Authority has to accept. But he does not know that I am fool No. 1, what is the value of my authority? Authority he must accept. But he makes himself his authority. That is the tendency now. "In my opinion." All rascals say like that. "In my opinion." He does not... He's rascal No. 1, what is the value of his opinion? But he'll say, "In my opinion." That is the difficulty. And this is called creative philosophy. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is going on. All rascals have creative philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> When I hear in the United States there's a saying, a slogan, amongst the young people: "Do your own thing." And also in India now when I go there they say, "So many men, so many minds."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is Vivekananda. <span class="Italic">Yata mata tata patha.</span> That means everyone can become authority. This is their philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And this they praised as good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> And others praise this as...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Very tolerant, liberal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes, but our philosophy, Kṛṣṇa says, "You rascal, give up everything. Just surrender unto Me." This is our philosophy. "You rascal, you give up everything and surrender unto Me." This is our philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's decrying this Vivekananda philosophy. Rascal philosophy. There was a suggestion when I (indistinct) international, I was going to register, they suggested, "Why don't you make God conscious? Why you make Kṛṣṇa conscious?" And if I had made God conscious so many rascals will bring so many Gods. Therefore specifically only Kṛṣṇa God. That's all. That is authorized. If you like, you take other's God. But this is our philosophy, <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> Was it not wise conclusion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If I have made a little liberal, God conscious, all rascals would have brought... "Here is my God." To stop this nonsense I made it Kṛṣṇa conscious. Kṛṣṇa is God only. Nobody is God. If you like this philosophy, come others' God. I don't want your cooperation. What is the use of cooperation of some rascaldom?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> That man yesterday wanted to know if we collaborated with other groups.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is collaboration. We are proposing this collaboration. All religion, they're after... Religion means to accept God. So if you accept God, we accept God. Then where is no cooperation? This is cooperation. But if you don't know what is God, we know. That is the difference. Ask this Christians, Mohammedans, and any other religious group, they have got a conception of God, ask them what is the form of God, what does He do, what is His..., so many things. They do not know. But we know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They simply say He is spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's all, vague idea. We say, "Here is God." So if you actually believe in God, why don't you take this God and the whole, all different types of religions become one? If you accept God, then we say, "Here is God." So where is the point of difference? How do you differ? Why do you say that you are different religion, my religion? Why do you say, "My religion"? Everyone... This is the only religion: to know God and love Him. What is their objection? To accept God, Kṛṣṇa? What is their object? What is their reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They want to gratify their senses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why do you make a different God? If you actually believe in God, I say, "Here is God." Why don't you accept? Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Impersonalism. They don't want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not God. God is person. That means you do not know God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say Jesus Christ is God too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Jesus Christ is God. That's right. But Jesus Christ said, "I'm son of God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. He said, "I'm at the right hand of the Father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> So he's different from the Father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even not different. But he says that he's son of God. We accept it. Why there are so many religions? If religion means acceptance of God, then here is God. Then make one religion. Why so many different religions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> In America there are two new sects, religious sects, that appear every month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every month. Different sect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every month, what do you mean by every month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Every month there are two new religious sects that appear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. And they'll accept God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> Well, they invent their own God their own way. In Europe they laugh at the Americans and their religions because they know this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If religion, new religion, that means new God? Or what it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> New way of approaching God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you want to approve God, if we agree to that, then this is the easiest process. You chant God's name and you approach. Why again new? This is the easiest proposition. Eh? Chant God's name and you approach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it says that those who are different modes of nature, they have different types of charity and different types of religion. So does this mean religions that are already established in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is means conditional religion. That is not absolute religion. In order to, what is called, summarize all types of religion... Just like Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mama vartmānuvartante manuṣyāḥ pārtha sarvaśaḥ,</span> "Everyone is trying to come to Me." So they are coming by different paths. So that is accepted. Now, when he says that "I am here. You're coming to Me, now you just surrender. Then everything is all right." Why don't you accept that? Why do you insist, "No, I shall come in a different way, different path"? What is this nonsense? God is saying "All right, you have got different paths, but give up that. Now simply surrender to Me." Where I am objection? If I am a really lover of God, God is saying like that, why not accept that? Why shall I pay for different paths? Eh? Suppose in this jungle you are scattered and you are searching "Where is Prabhupāda? Where is Prabhupāda?" And somebody says, "Come this way. Come this way." And if I say, "Not this way, that way. Come here. Come here." What is your objection? Eh? Either you don't want me... (laughs) Eh? You don't want me. You want to play some whimsical way. You are not serious about me? If you're actually serious about God, God says here, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām e...</span> [Bg. 18.66]. "Give up all this nonsense. Just surrender un..." Why they do not accept it. Eh? What is your answer, Satsvarūpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I think your answer's that they want to play a kind of hide and seek. They don't really want to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is their foolishness. They don't want to go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-gaurāṅga:</span> They say they would rather search than find.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But search. That's all right. Search means you do not know, therefore searching. But if you're searching for something and you get that something then why you should search any more? Searching means you do not know. You're searching. But if I say "Come here. I am here." Just like child is crying. There is no toys, his mother... Mother says, "Child, come here." He comes here. That's all. That is real searching. Or what is this searching? Either you do not know what you are searching or you are making a false play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Is this one bathroom? Religion means actually relation with God, to know God. They don't think like that. They say religion does not mean search of God. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that there's one place that you cannot see God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right but what do you mean by religion first of all? I cannot see God. That is another thing. But that does not mean there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I cannot see the president. That does not mean there is no president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because I cannot see therefore there's no president. Is that very good logic?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not see. You're unfit to see. You're not qualified to see. But why there shall be no God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> I was taught that that is God's nature, invisible spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I was taught in religion that God... That is His nature, not that I can't see Him, but He is a person. But that I can't see Him because He's invisible spirit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Invisible. That means you have no eyes to see. Even if He is spirit. That's all right. But invisible means you have no capacity to see. That is the meaning of invisible. That I cannot see. So you're disqualified, that does not mean He's dis... not visible. He's visible but not to you because you have no eyes to see Him. That we also say. Therefore we have to prepare the eyes to see. That is religion. I cannot see at the present moment that does not mean I shall stop (indistinct). I must prepare myself how to see. That is real intelligence. (end)</div>
