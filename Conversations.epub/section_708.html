<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they have a saying that "Laws are for being broken."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "Laws are for being broken."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is intelligence. If you can break laws, that is intelligence. So many laws. So which way we shall go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] We can go this way, straight. It goes around the park, around the lake. Usually the mother and the father, or at least the mother, they stay pretty close by.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is double zero?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a z missing. Actually "Zoo Lake" it is called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are many zoos. Hare Kṛṣṇa. Just see. They do not check their population. How many? About one dozen? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ten. Eleven. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...He used to collect all these things for guru's cooking. Kṛṣṇa went to collect with Sudāmā Vipra, and all of a sudden, there was cloud and rain, and there was too much water, and they lived upon a tree for the whole night. Then Sāndīpani Muni, other students, came and rescued them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now we have to collect to pay the electricity bill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These things are wasted. It can be utilized. The children, they'll gladly collect it. It will be like their sports. All the children will come and collect. Just see. Their energy is utilized, the nature's gift is utilized, and there is no expenditure.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Such a nice arrangment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why they should charge for education? They'll not cut the tree. The dry branches or dead tree, they'll take the wood for utilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can walk down this way, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break] ...parents who would give up their children to <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> they would never see them for about ten years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never see. Ten years? Twenty-five years. They may go and see, give some gifts to the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Western countries they criticize our <span class="Italic">gurukula</span> that "This is inhuman, people sending their children away at such an early age, not seeing them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And to kill, that is very human. Rascal. Kick them upon their face. You rascal, you are talking of morality, rascal, you go to hell. Your place is hell. "Devil citing scripture." You are not... You are so shameless that you do not be ashamed to speak like that. You are so shameless. Your civilization is so shameless. You are killing child in the womb, and you are talking "inhumanity." Just see. We have to deal with such fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But they say the child in the womb is not living. They say it's not life yet. Only after it takes birth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is said by you. You, the tenth-class rascal, you say like that. No sane man says like that. Because you are a tenth-class rascal-you have no knowledge-you say like that. They are... The so-called scientists, they are tenth-class rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Until the child is moving there is no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moving, it is not moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No. It doesn't move until after seven months.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why the dead child cannot move, rascal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's developing, it's growing. That's moving also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, if moving is not there, then the dead child is also not moving. Why he is not moving again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A dead child comes; it is not moving. But does it come to movement again?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is another rascal. He takes so much time to answer. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This idea of the "devil citing scripture," Prabhupāda, is very common.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Devils, all devils.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They wanted to write an article about this for BTG, and everybody was sitting around giving these examples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, think over. Write article. If there was no life who is at a certain stage in the womb, wherefrom the movement comes, if there was no life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They say it develops to the point...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why it does not develop in a dead child, rascal? The same child, if it comes out dead, why the movement does not develop?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, that one already developed properly and then died. That child already developed properly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the process is the same. It was not moving. At a cetain stage it is moving. Similarly, if it is not moving, then wait for a certain stage; it will move. Why it is decomposed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But that dead child was moving and then died.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it became dead, nonsense? The condition is the same, no movement. So how do you say "dead"? Why do you say "dead"? The distinction is it was not moving, and it is now not moving, so why do you call "dead"? In such a foolish society, how people can be happy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's the mother's choice to kill the child or not. If the child isn't born yet, it hasn't come to life in the world, so the mother has the responsibility; she can kill it or not because it's her thing, her child, her production, so she can kill it or not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I can kill you; I am your guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who can say anything? I can kill you. Why police is there? I can say, "He is my disciple. He has fully surrendered. I can kill him." That's all. Will that argument save me from police action?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. The child is so dependent on the mother, if the mother mistreats the opportunity, she also is punished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But if the child would cause the mother so much anxiety...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't talk like foolish. Don't talk of that. It is waste of time. If it is the property of the mother, mother can kill at any time. Why at a certain point if the mother kills child she is hanged? If the mother has got the liberty to kill the child, she can kill at any time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's just a tumor. It's like a tumor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you say that it is mother's right to kill? And tumor, can you bring life in tumor? Kick simply on their face, on their nose. That is the only thing to treat with such... <span class="Italic">Murkhasya latausadhiḥ.</span> Such fools in the society, they should be hanged. Misleading the whole population.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Even the big, big philosophers simply say that life doesn't start until it comes out of the womb. They are just convinced of it. They are just convinced of it. No matter what argument you give, they are just simply convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they are convinced? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda's argument is that if life is not there in the womb, then how it develops?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is the point. Just like the eggs. If there is no life, how the chicken comes? Why don't you manufacture an egg and bring life from it? That was... The other day I was talking. So because you are tenth-class rascal you cannot understand how the life is there. A seed. Take a seed. Unless there is life, how a big tree comes out of it? You manufacture something like that, imitating, and bring life. Life is there. Because you are tenth-class rascal you do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They also bring up the insane argument that life...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Insane argument." How we have...? We have no time to hear such insane argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But these demons, Prabhupāda, they pose themselves as being very religious. They pose themselves as being very religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How they are religious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They cite scripture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) The scripture is also devilish. What is these marks?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They grow the grass around the outside and when the green inside has some hole in it like there, they plug it up with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The scientists cannot immediately accept authority of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> that it will take hundreds of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Less intelligent. No intelligence. Therefore I was quoting that, <span class="Italic">sva-vi-varāhoṣṭra-kharai saṁstuta puruṣaḥ paśuḥ.</span> This class of scientists and such, they are eulogized by small rascals. They are rascals, and small rascals... That is actually happening. Just like your President Nixon. How he was being given reception, crowd. Hundreds and thousands of people used to come. And then again get him down, make him humiliated as far as possible. So this is a rascal, Nixon, and the person who elected him, they are rascals. Therefore the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">sva-vi-varāhoṣṭra-kharai saṁstutaḥ.</span> Here is one big animal, and the small animals voting him. That's all. This is the society, animal society-the small animals praising the big animals. That's all. All of them are animals only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The big animals also prey on the small animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Mutual praising society. That's all. "I praise you and you praise me. I say you are very big; you say I am very big." That's all. And compromise. "I don't criticize you; you don't criticize me." That's all. [break] In the womb the child got life and when the... Sometimes some child comes, stunt. By process again he cries. So why the dead child is not brought into life by that? What do you call dead?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stillborn. Still. When it's born dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So... No, no. How the life came? How it became dead? This is eucalyptus, very hard. Eucalyptus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has smell.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Very hard. No need. [break] ...question, ask them that in the egg there is no life, and the life is coming by what is called? Fermenta... No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fertilization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fertilization or... No, giving the heat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Incubation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Incubation. So why don't you make such egg and put it into incubation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We challenge them like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then why you are talking nonsense that there is no life? Why you are depending on other life for giving you the egg? So this theory that life comes from chemical, so where it is true? Life is coming from the ... a life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they say that life is simply a combination of chemicals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it now. It is not difficult. You can see the egg's chemical, and just combine little chemicals and put it in the incubator. Let life come. Hm? What is your answer? The advocate speaks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Yes, we are working on it." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Working on it. Eh? What is the answer? How long you will work? Is there any time limit? Eh? What is that work? What is the answer? Hm? How long you will work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I don't think anybody is trying to make an egg.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Why not? Why they are not making, trying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They know they can't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, there are certain scientists that are trying to create life, but they've been unsuccessful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do they talk nonsense, what the nonsense says? This is a very good suggestion, that egg is chemical composition. Make a chemical composition like that. That yellow, what is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yolk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yolk. You color it. Some chemical and color it. What is difficulty? Sometimes they say a man is dead because the color of the blood has changed. From red to..., it has become white. So where is the difficulty to make it red again? Do it. Change the color again. Make it red. And if you say, "No, that natural redness is required," so there are so many flowers, natural red. Why there is no life? If redness, natural redness, is the cause of life, so there are so many flowers, red flowers. Why they do not walk? If you say that the... "Besides that, the life substance is missing," that is also not correct. Life substance is there in the dead body; otherwise how worms are coming out? Life is coming out. Not one, but hundreds are coming out. How you can say the life substance is missing? The worms are coming automatically, but you take the portion of the dead body and produce worm. That you cannot do. So which way you are going to take credit as scientist? Now which way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can walk through there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These arguments are not sufficient to defeat the atheists?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> People in general might accept it, but the scientists could always come up with...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why the scientists will not accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, they don't want to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that is another thing, obstinacy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Just like they... In Australia they created those enzymes which were moving and were the basic components of life. So then they say, "Well, we've gone so far and created these first enzymes, the initial component of life. So we'll put them together in the future." And people... That may be an argument. It's not a very good one, but they will accept. All the scientists will accept it, that they've gone so far and done that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then who is the scientist who is producing so many lives? You have not met him, but actually we see what you are trying to become successful in future, it is already there. Now, who is that big scientist? Why don't you find him out? Why don't you call him and give him Nobel Prize? Why you are taking? You are rascal. What is their answer? Already things are coming. There are so many lives, so that you are killing lives, being afraid of overpopulation. So he is creating so many lives that you think of it as overpopulation, overproduction. So what is your credit if you suppose in future you create one life? What credit you are going to give him? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...experimentation, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Science is based on experimentation. They will argue, "So how can we experiment with the theories that you are putting forward?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our theory or your theory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your theory. Our theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that "our theory"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That the soul is the life force.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So how can we prove that? How can we make the spirit soul appear?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How can you bring life force? Have you brought? Then how you can question this? If you have brought life otherwise, then you can question. As you cannot bring life otherwise, you have to accept this. This is the proof. Not only that: because the soul is there, therefore I am talking with you. I am replying your inquiries. And when the soul is not there, even the tongue is there, even the ear is there, I cannot hear you, I cannot reply you. [break] ...instrument is there by which I talk, why he cannot talk?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The spirit soul is not present.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems that you've made it so easy to defeat the scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yet all the universities, schools throughout the world, they're simply following this experimental knowledge of the scientists. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...machine is recording, but as soon as electricity stops-the machine is there-it will not record. You cannot say the machine is the ultimate. Machine is there; it will not record as soon as the electricity is missing. So that electricity, either you say soul or something else, you replace it. Just like electricity means the battery you charge, it will work, again record. Similarly, if you say "That is not soul, something missing," so you can replace it. What is that something? That something also you do not know. Then how can you refute my argument, soul? You do not know anything. I at least know something on the basis of <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> But you have neither <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> nor experiment, nothing else. So who is strong? I am strong or you are strong?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Our position is very weak against these arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I have got some evidences-Kṛṣṇa is speaking, the Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra...</span> And what you have got? Simply your speaking? What you are, nonsense? Your speaking should be accepted? And Kṛṣṇa's speaking will be rejected? I have got some support, but what support you have got except your statement? Then everyone can give a statement and he becomes an authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But there are so many millions and millions of people who hold the opposite view. They feel that their position is very safe because it's the general consensus opinion that life comes from matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> General consensus of opinion... Let them say that there will be no more death, and how it will act? General consensus of opinion... Let them vote, "We do not want death anymore." Will it be accepted?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? What is the value of your vote? You are madmen. Just like Gandhi made civil disobedience here, and government did not accept it. What could he do? [break] ...truth. If the majority says, "No, it is truth," it will be truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then untruth is untruth. (end)</div>
