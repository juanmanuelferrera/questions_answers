<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays people are taking to the (indistinct) of industry. But we don't find in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> there is any suggestion for industry. Kṛṣṇa said... It started?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's recording.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No no, you stop this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You want to play this tape back?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> So until the father makes one (indistinct) of Śrī Vaiṣṇava... And the <span class="Italic">śaraṇāgati</span> makes them assured of <span class="Italic">mukti.</span> So <span class="Italic">kṛta-kṛtya.</span> Now, the later part of life, (Sanskrit). (Hindi)... of Rāmānuja school. This Rāmānuja school has been fortified by his works, so many works on Vedānta, like (Sanskrit names of books) These are all the major Vedānta works he has composed. All these works I have sat before a guru and studied for eight years at Śrī Raṅgam. My <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> has been a great scholar in Vedānta and <span class="Italic">tarka,</span> who was lecturer in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know, Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> they are very learned scholars. I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> And they are very particular about <span class="Italic">ācaraṇas</span> also, more than...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sadācāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> Ha. <span class="Italic">Sadācāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> And I have been given guidance by these <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> to stick to this <span class="Italic">paramparā sampradāya ācāra.</span> So I belong to this sahogala(?) order. I have taken initiation from this guru, as well as Vedantic knowledge from another guru. I am practicing my <span class="Italic">ācāra, sampradāya ācāra</span> very strictly in that order. As far as I see, there is... Without disturbing this set-up, I can do service, I think. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our mission is to spread Kṛṣṇa's mission. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> Mission. That's all. We need not change the other set-up need not. Necessity is not there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. We have got already set up, what Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> So our business is how to teach people to surrender to Kṛṣṇa. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> Now, this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> this <span class="Italic">Śrī Bhāṣya</span> of Rāmānuja, and commentary on which is <span class="Italic">Śruta-prakāśikā,</span> composed by one Sudarśana Suri... He was later, about hundred years later than Rāmānuja. He has commented on <span class="Italic">Śrī Bhāṣya.</span> These works are the standard works, for (indistinct). Actually it is the foundation over which the superstructure is constructed by Vedānta-deśika.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You see, we have got different philosophical... Ultimately the conclusion is how to surrender to Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> That is it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the Western countries, their brain is not so sharp to clearly understand the difference between <span class="Italic">viśiṣṭādvaita, advaita-dvaita, dvaitādvaita,</span> or <span class="Italic">advaita.</span> (laughs) Their brain does not allow to think very deeply about... So we are simply teaching them, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī māṁ namaskuru [Bg. </span>18.65]<span class="Italic">.</span> That includes all philosophy. In this way we are preaching all over the world and there is little response. We are selling our books very nicely. So our main purpose is to spread Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That is our main... So what is your idea now. How you want to utilize your learning about Vaiṣṇava philosophy? Yes. Yes. How you want to do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> Now, this is my idea. That knowledge that I have must be utilized in this manner. It can be utilized in this manner. You are creating so many disciples. They are interested in learning <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> and the philosophy and other things. Serious students who are interested in philosophy, who would like to go sit and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll find hardly anyone interested in philosophy nowadays. They are interested in technology. In Western countries the universities are closing philosophical class. No student is coming. This is the position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> I came for philosophy, even in this age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, your case is different. But generally people they are losing interest in philosophy because they are becoming <span class="Italic">śūdras. Kalau śūdra-sambhavaḥ.</span> They are after some job to get money. So they see that "What I shall get by learning philosophy? Let me learn technology. I'll get a good job and good money and enjoy life." This is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> That is general trend. Of course, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In India also the same thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> Yes, yes. I was working in Bombay as a stenographer in a private company. In 1964 I resigned my job after reading Vivekananda's works. I'll tell you about some of my own history. Afterwards I went and joined the... I went and stayed in Hrishikesh Shivananda āśrama for two months, and I wanted to study this philosophy, etc., in the originals. But at Shivananda āśrama it was not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> No facility. So I left there. I came all the way, decided to select a place for myself. After touring Mathurā, Vṛndāvana, all these places, Kāśī, I came to Lucknow. In Lucknow Ramakrishna Mission I had been to. There was one Gauda Shivananda. He discussed with me, and he directed me to Calcutta. Then I went to Calcutta, and when I went to Calcutta, that Swami Gambhirananda, who is the general secretary now, was there. He asked me to join the Mission. I joined Ramakrishna Mission. I was in Ramakrishna Mission in Calcutta for one year. And I was taking care of their printing section, this proof-reading, editing, etc., Ramakrishna Vivekananda literature for one year. But still, my idea of going to the original texts of this Vedānta commentary etc., was not fulfilled. So I was not satisfied. Then I left that Ramakrishna Mission and traveled all the way from Calcutta to Kerala. There is another āśrama at Kerala, Parlika near Trichu, where there was one Swami Purnananda Tirtha who used to come to Bombay every year for giving lectures. So I went to his āśrama<span class="Italic">.</span> I knew of that. And there I started studying this <span class="Italic">Śaṅkara Bhāṣya, Gītā Bhāṣya</span> and <span class="Italic">Sūtra Bhāṣya</span> for six months under one Swami Atmananda, who is no more, who has written Śaṅkara's words, the words, in his own words, teachings in his own words. <span class="Italic">Bhavan's Journal</span> has published and the four yogas and so on and so forth, such books. He was a disciple of Swami Ramadasa of Kanaiḥ. So after six months that was also not satisfying to me. I then came to Śrī Raṅgam. There I went to a Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> He said, first you equip yourself with the fundamental <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> of <span class="Italic">tarka,</span> <span class="Italic">vyakāraṇa,</span> and <span class="Italic">mīmāṁsā.</span> Then come to Vedānta. Then, later on, in Sanskrit College I went and studied for two and a half years this fundamentals of Vedānta, <span class="Italic">tarka, vyakāraṇa, mīmāṁsā,</span> and then I came to Śrī Raṅgam back and studied Vedānta. There for eight years I studied Vedānta. Say in all twelve years. Ten years. Another two years... I have been in Tirupati for the past two years, specializing in the higher texts of <span class="Italic">Mīmāṁsā.</span> (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> So this is how for the past twelve years I have been going in search of this sources from where I can get all this knowledge, and after much roaming about, I have got this knowledge. So I would like to put it to proper use. I would like to teach it to so many people who are interested in it. At least...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that opportunity you'll get in our mission.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> That is how I want to serve.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That opportunity you'll get. So now give him some resting place just now. And you take some of our books and go on. Then, after taking my meals, I shall come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, this Minister Rao, he's just arrived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just now? So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> What shall I do? Ask him to wait or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's ten minutes before <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Call him. Call him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paṇḍita:</span> I shall wait till you finish your meals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So you can take in your room. Give him some plate. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> You give (Hindi) So you have brought? So if you kindly wait, then I can finish my meals. Then I shall talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Oh, yes. We will go. We have come here just to have your <span class="Italic">darśana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I have to talk with you something. So if you kindly wait...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> I will wait.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then give him some place. Give him some book. He may read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> I'll sit for a while.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> In the evening I am coming to six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Seven o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Seven-thirty, plane takes off, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes, but Prabhupāda going to the... Before one hour.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Before one hour?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I heard that you were coming at 4:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Five o'clock, they said, because I won't be able to come here. That is why I thought that now I'll just go and have your <span class="Italic">darśana</span> and take your program of Delhi, whenever you're going to be. Now I've become <span class="Italic">celā</span> of yours. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have asked your wife and children to chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> before Bālajī as much time as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> As many times as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So she has told you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> They're doing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a great fortune that Bālajī is there in your home. Take full advantage and simply chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Simple. Then everything will come automatically. <span class="Italic">Buddhi-yogaṁ dadāmi tam. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<br class="calibre2"/>dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ<br class="calibre2"/>yena mām upayānti te<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>10.10]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is the very easiest method. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Sit down as much time as you can devote. The Lord is at your home. It is a great fortune. So do this, both, all family together. Yes. And I have seen, you are fortunate enough that you have got good wife and good children. That is a great fortune. Nobody is against you. Everyone is favorable. Oh, that's a great opportunity. In some family the wife goes another way, the children goes another way. That is very disturbing. But you are so fortunate that everyone is just obedient to the head of the family. So utilize, whole family, this simple method. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Sit down before Bālajī. You are fortunate Bālajī is there. Do this. Then we shall talk further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> So when shall we meet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As you like.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> I'll come to Delhi.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you are coming to the airport, then we shall talk further. That all. Thank you very much. You have taken little <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Minister:</span> Yes, I have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thank you very much. (end)</div>
