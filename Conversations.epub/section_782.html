<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> ...absorbed in thinking that, for example, in this material world a sunset is very nice or something is very nice. But if, for example, in Māyāpura is a devotee free to, for example, enjoy the, all the scenery without...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do you think Māyāpura is material world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Why you are asking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That is what I was thinking, that this is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Dhāma.</span> Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">dhāma. Dhāma</span> means not material world. <span class="Italic">Goloka-dhāma, Vṛndāvana-dhāma.</span> So <span class="Italic">dhāma</span> is not material world. (aside:) Not to go away. [break] ...visible with these eyes, similarly, <span class="Italic">dhāma</span> also is not visible with these eyes. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva hṛdayeṣu vilokayanti</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is <span class="Italic">dhāma. Premāñjana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> [break] In Toronto, Śrīla Prabhupāda... When we purchased the new church in Toronto we sold all the church pews. And Billy Graham... Do you know who Billy Graham is? He's an Evangelist preacher in the United States. He sometimes went to that church to preach. So when we sold the pews we would tell people that "Billy Graham sat in this pew," and they would become excited to purchase.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it was sold in good price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> As you are always saying, Prabhupāda, these people are not becoming purified. This one man who Jagadīśa mentioned, he's the most famous Christian preacher practically in the Western world. Now he's becoming older, about sixty. Recently they asked him that "If you could live your life again, would you live the same life or a different life?" So he said, "I am very sorry because I spent too much of my time preaching. I should have spent more time with my family."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, he actually said that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. At the end of life this is his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's the foremost Christian preacher in the world right now, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said, "I accepted too many invitations to go preach. I should have spent time with my family."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That will make him more popular, and they'll say he's more religious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> [break] ...already left to preach.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. [break] Eh? <span class="Italic">Dhunvanti, aghaṁ dhunvanti kārtsnyena nīhāram iva bhāskaraḥ.</span>(?) This is Kṛṣṇa. In one second He can make it purified. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simply surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It seems like our desire not to surrender is very powerful because Kṛṣṇa is so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not powerful. Yes, powerful.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Kṛṣṇa is so powerful and yet our nonsense is so strong that we can resist such a powerful force as Kṛṣṇa's love.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the whole sky clear, hundreds of miles. [break] ...all right? Where is in-charge? [break] ...and clan spirit. Aborigines, they fight amongst their clans.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Aborigines?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda? You wrote in a letter to Bhagavān... You said that originally the Europeans had Aryan-type culture but they have become degraded.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. They are still Aryan. Europeans are Aryan, Indo-Aryan. That is admitted in history.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> You said that they became degraded by associating, by bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, by association with these aborigines.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Who were the aborigines they associated with?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere there were aborigines. In India there are still aborigines, <span class="Italic">ādivāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You were saying, Prabhupāda, the Huns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Huns. They were considered like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Huns are also lower than the <span class="Italic">śūdras, caṇḍālas,</span> dog-eaters, animal-eaters. And these Europeans historians, they take the aborigines, their original father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Their what, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Original father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You said, "Yes, they are your original father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. "The aborigines, the naked <span class="Italic">jaṅgalīs,</span> they were original person." Do they not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Before that, there was the caveman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, caveman. That's... Caveman. That is aborigine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And before the caveman was the missing link.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he has known missing link.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't know who they're missing, 'cause he's missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see the imagination, fanatic imagination. He is creating...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...a theory, a species.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Missing link species. And they have... They have models of this missing link.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They know it; still "missing."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Although it's missing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Missing" means they know only, "Oh, he knows."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> When I was preaching in California, one very famous anthropologist came to speak there, and he gave a new theory about the origin of the species. So he said... Before the audience he said that "Actually we have very little evidence of this theory."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said that "We have very little evidence for this theory," but he said that "All of you should not be disturbed because our previous theory, we had no evidence whatsoever. [laughter] So this is an improvement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He admitted. "Previous theory, that was nonsense," and still the nonsense going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "So don't be disturbed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "So you are dealing with all nonsense. Don't be disappointed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Another professor, he was very, a world famous geneticist, professor of genetics. I remember, when I was a student there, he was always trying to prove that there was no God. That was his mission. So he was in so much anxiety-he's an older man-that he would simply stand up every day and shake. During the whole class he was actually shaking with anxiety. He could hardly speak. He was famous scientist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he was shaking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He was in so much anxiety. He was very, very nervous. He would just shake, always trying to prove there is no God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...their society, and they are advocating, "No temple or Deity worship." So one boy, so he was a member of this society. So there is <span class="Italic">Śītalā-mātā,</span> the goddess of smallpox. So he had some trouble in the house, smallpox. So he thought of going to the <span class="Italic">Śītalā-mātā</span>'s temple. So he's entering the temple and seeing in this way, "Mother, I am your devotee but they will tax me. Therefore I am going out." (laughter) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So this man, he is afraid of God, but he has to preach there is no God. So he was feeble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In every class he would smoke at least four or five cigarettes. He was so nervous. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The living entity is victimized, and in this life you can adventure to conquer over it. This is human life. The cats and dogs, they cannot fight with <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> but a human being, he can fight. So if we don't fight, we don't take that adventure, then we remain cats and dogs. The cats and dogs, they fight amongst themselves but not with the <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So aborigines, although they have got features of human being, they are no more than the cats and dogs. So they also fight amongst themselves. They do not know that the fighting spirit should be utilized to declare war against <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is possible in human life. <span class="Italic"><i class="calibre3">Athāto brahma jijñāsā</i>.</span> This fighting is philosophy. "What is the ultimate cause? What is Brahman? What I am?" Fighting against darkness, sleeping. <span class="Italic">Kota nidrā jāo māyā-piśācīra kole.</span> Everyone is sleeping on the lap of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Now, this human form of life is not for sleeping but for awakening and fight with <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> That is human life. [break] You were reading the other day why the sun changes color after rising?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The refraction of the light rays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He said that the light rays pass through the clouds, and this diverts the light rays in different ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is the cloud?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Not necessarily a cloud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Through the atmosphere, the air.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Atmosphere density is different, so it changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Density?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When it is directly overhead...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, it is fixed up. Why it should change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When it's directly overhead, there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, overhead means it has gone. If it is fixed, why it should change color?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We have gone; it has not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> It changes color to us. It doesn't change color. To our eyes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> ...the color changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because our eyes are not so..., are blunt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say because the light rays...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If the sun is fixed, so why our eyes will change? If we see in the beginning, as you see, it is red, and it is fixed, it should remain red.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say the atmosphere changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The light of the sun filters through the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Atmosphere changes? Where is atmosphere changes? It is the same atmosphere. We saw in red and the atmosphere same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Angle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> According to your angle of vision.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Medium. Medium. Prabhupāda, there is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you are all scientists I know. Please talk with one body. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's an angle...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughter) All rascals. Scientists means all rascals. That I know. You haven't got to explain. I am trying to understand that if the sun is... Suppose a red light is fixed. So red light is always red light. Why it should be white? What is the cause?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They say there's a spec...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They say." What you say? What you have understood?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> There's a spectrum of different colors which, combined together, is white light, but when the light bends, the different colors of light bend at different angles so that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the light bends? I am a crude man; I am not scientist. I say I see one red light there. So it is always red. Why it should be white?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But the sunlight...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again "sunlight." Please explain this. The light is fixed, and it is reddish. So why it should change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Only part of the light reaches us, the red part, not all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, the color changes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Because in the beginning, when the sun is red, only the red part of the light spectrum reaches our eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That means it is moving. Red part is gone. Then white part comes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Then, when the rest of the light reaches our eyes it becomes white.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say we are moving. It is not moving; we are moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The earth is turning. The sun is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They also say the sun is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But very slowly. They say the earth is turning, so you see the sun as moving, but actually you are moving. Just like if you are in a car and you are moving, it may appear that just as... Sometimes you can see another object...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that's all... But why the color should change? That is point. You may move...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because, he's explaining, that light is seen when it bends... White light when it bends at different angles...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is only applicable when you accept that the sun is moving. Therefore atmosphere is going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, the earth is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They say the earth is turning. Therefore at a certain point the sun is actually below the horizon, but part of the sun's light, the red spectral, the red light of the sun, comes over the horizon and so the sun appears...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Red, but actually it's not reddish; it's white or yellow, whatever.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually it is white, that's all right, but if you see one fixed thing, a color, practical experience is the color does not change if it is fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Supposing you are... Supposing there's a white light, and you are situated here, and in front of you is a screen with many colors, and you are moving different ways along this screen. Sometimes you are looking through a green, sometimes... in that way although the light is fixed up, because you are moving behind different colors...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is that screen?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's called the spectrum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Spectrum. So where is that? That is also finished?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The atmosphere is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> The atmosphere is the screen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> As the spectrum hits the atmosphere, it bends.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Just like a prism, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the speed of the earth changes. Eh? In the morning you see the sun is very slowly rising, either sun's speed or your speed. But now you see it is rising very quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's explained that because the sun... Actually you can see it before it appears over the horizon because the light rays reach our eyes before the sun actually comes up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But that's only eight minutes' difference. That won't explain it, because the light rays reach in eight minutes. That won't explain it. That would only cause an eight-minute difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> No, no, no. No, it's not because of the time it takes. It's because of... The light rays bend. So they bend towards us before the sun comes up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You can't actually see the sun. You're seeing only a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda said, "But it rises so quickly."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Huh? Then, once it comes up over the horizon, we see it rise at its normal pace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Doesn't explain. Word jugglery. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...fixed. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Fixed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Is not moving around the earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's further away from us than the sun and twice as big as the sun. Ask Prabhupāda how big is the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Prabhupāda, how big is this moon? Is much more bigger than this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see in the Fifth Canto. There is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That means that <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is just like a magician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, certainly. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">māyā. Māyā</span> means magician. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> means... <span class="Italic">māyā</span> means affection, <span class="Italic">māyā</span> means illusion, magician, so many things-strength, potency.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is your explanation why the sun changes colors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> What is your explanation as to why the sun changes colors?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun is moving. You are seeing through some color. Then it is color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Seeing through some color.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like there are... In your window there is glass, red. So sun is passing; you say sun red. And again it has come; it is white. That is our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the scientists say the same thing except they say that the earth is moving, not the sun. Same explanation you have given for the colors, they give, except that they say that the earth that is moving, not the sun. They wouldn't accept that point as a proof that the sun is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, sun is moving because the earth and the sun... The distance is the same, but you can calculate the distance from the rising up to the... It is millions, millions of miles. So unless the sun is moving, the earth cannot move so swiftly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> They are always the same distance apart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The earth and the sun are always the same distance apart?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Same distance is to be supposed according to your theory, because sun is fixed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> According to our theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The same distance. But you calculate that how quickly it comes. You calculate the distance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, how can the earth move so quickly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> The earth is just spinning around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, they would say that that is not from the..., that is not from the earth moving around the sun. That is from the earth rotating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Rotating on its axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> And turning different sides, different faces to the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And that's possible. That speed the earth could do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That much speed the earth could do, simply to turn around on its own...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's rotation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's rotation, it's not an orbit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Like a top, spinning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> From its axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So they say the earth is spinning around so fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why doesn't it fall off? That's another point, Prabhupāda. The earth is spinning, they say, but it's tilted on one side. So why it doesn't fall over?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This earth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Scientists say the earth is like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes. Making an angle, Prabhupāda, spinning around its axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> My question is how something doesn't fall, just fall over? Like a top. If you spin a top, when it starts spinning on its side it falls over.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> But so far space is concerned, they don't see that there's a top or a bottom where it can fall.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Then why do they say axis? Axis means there's a top and a bottom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...by mental platform, on the mental plane.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> When I was in the university I took a course...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Yes. The same example. This was spoken by one scientist in Delhi, that if a man has learned how to imitate the dog barking, people will go to see him by purchasing ticket. But he won't hear the dog, real dog, barking. So we are like that. We are trying to imitate dog.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it here, Jayapatākā? Yes, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...fective, what you can see from the observatory?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why they use a telescope, to make their eyes perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Telescope also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> With the help of the telescope, then their eyes become perfect to an extent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To ext... That is not perfect. As soon as you say, "to extent," that means imperfect. Perfect to the point, that is perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Limitedly perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your philosophy will be very unpopular with the general masses, Prabhupāda, because you are condemning everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they are fools and rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, but Prabhupāda presents it so nicely that people will like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Especially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's true, Prabhupāda. Sometimes you call them "rascal" to their face, and they like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> That's what happened to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Especially Indians. Lot of people like strong words. This rascal means...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In America it's not such a strong word. In America that word "rascal" is not so strong as in India. In India when you use that word, they become very offended.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes. Very strong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> In America they like to be rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In America if the father chastises the child, he calls him "rascal."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It has a nice connotation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] <span class="Italic">māyāra adhikāra.</span> Now the ruling of this, what is called, fog is finished.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Night also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Everything darkness finished. The sky is clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The fog was just on the ground. It wasn't up...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I saw in the morning the fog was low but it was not high up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, it is finished, high or low. Explain that there is such-and-such things in the sun, eh? They say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do they not manufacture another imitation sun? If they know what is the composition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They're so puffed up that they think that actually the credit is to them for discovering. Just like they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is discovering? It is covering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They give the example that if a tree falls in the forest and there is no man there to hear it, then actually it has not fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This is a philosophical example which is... This is the most common example they give, that if a tree falls in the forest but there is no man there, there is no one there to hear it, then actually it has never happened. Unless someone perceives it, then it does not exist. So they feel that when they discover something, at that time it begins to exist by their becoming conscious of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if you're sleeping and I kill you and you weren't conscious that I was killing you, then you're still alive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not killed. Then it comes as a... You can go to the court: "It is not killed."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They will say that... No, I will say. I will take the part of the rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> I'll be the rascal. "No, actually I am killed, because even though I may not be conscious of it, someone is conscious of it. As long as someone must be... Just when something... It is necessary that someone be conscious of it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, supposing in the woods. You're in the woods and I kill you during your sleep. There is no other human being there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "But you were conscious of it. You were conscious of my death, so therefore my death is a fact."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then in the forest there are no animals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot... They are not conscious?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, if an animal hears, that's all right also. As long as someone is conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the forest there are many animals, hundreds and thousands. They are conscious that tree has fallen. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Then it would also be acceptable. As long as some living being has...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then what is this? Everywhere someone is conscious. There is no vacancy. So this is useless talking, fool's talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> In the outer space there is no consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who says? The fools say. There are consciousness. There are so many birds flying from one planet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Higher up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Higher means it is higher for you because you are so dwarf. You are so dwarfed, you'll find that this tree is very big tree. You see? A small dwarf man, a pigmy, he'll say, "Oh, it is a big tree." So it is all relative. What is called? Relative world? Higher and lower, this is all relativity. You are so low that you see a tiny thing very high. It is due to your lowerness. Where there is no tree, these trees will be considered: "Oh, very high tree." So your scientists and your appreciator, all, they are like tiny dwarfs. What do they know about the universal affair? That is their fault. They are so small... That, the same example, Dr. Frog, calculating Atlantic Ocean. This is the fault. They do not consider their position. Just like there are thousands of ants. We can immediately kill them. And they are thinking they are very big, the ants, that "We are very busy. We are very big." So these rascals' position is like that. If the <span class="Italic">devatās</span> in higher planets like, all the population of this material, this earth, they can kill like this-finish. Just like we can kill the ants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, in the Sixth Canto, second part, I haven't read it yet, but I saw a picture of a big demon who was fighting, and everyone else was just like little ants.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. That was described in some English book, the man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> <span class="Italic">Gulliver's Travels.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha, ha, yes. These rascals, they do not know there is Gulliver. They are thinking very big.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Also, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when there is some natural calamity... Like I read in the newspaper, four thousand people were killed immediately in Guatemala.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> That is also the demigods?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, greater than you, you admit it, demigods or God or anything. But why you are thinking yourself so big? That is your fault. That is foolishness. I am a big man amongst a small, tiny living entities. But why you are thinking you are biggest of all, you can understand everything? That is your fault. This is the folly of the conditioned soul. He is nothing. He has no value. Still, he is thinking he is very great. Everything is big and small relatively. Just like here if one man has got 100,000 rupees, he's a big man. But what is 100,000 rupees in America? Nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> One year's salary for an average man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> A worker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Lakhpati.</span> Here they call, <span class="Italic">lakhpati. Lakhpati</span> means owner of 100,000 rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Lakhpati.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is this <span class="Italic">lakhpati</span> there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This fog appears just like an ocean, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It looks just like the ocean.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Frozen. Frozen ocean. Means they are defeated; they are coming down. By the sun they are defeated. They were high. "Now go down." Now it will be finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Burnt off. [break] What is the way to draw the line between the following three things: blasphemy, fault-finding, and calling a spade a spade?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A spade a spade... Just like I am saying that "What you are? You are small fig only." That is reality. And what is the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The other is fault-finding and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fault-finding, that is another fault, that... <span class="Italic">vraṇam icchanti, makṣikā vraṇam icchanti, madhum icchanti(?)</span> Just like the flies, they are finding out where is sore, and the bees, they are finding out where there is honey. So two animals, they have got two business: fault-finding and collecting the good things. These are two... Just like creature. They are two classes. Similarly, there are many rascals who are simply fault-finding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And blasphemy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Blasphemy means you have good qualities, but still, I am defaming you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So the saintly person tends to overlook the bad qualities and see the good ones.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like Kṛṣṇa's dealing with Pūtanā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hundreds and thousands of miles, this fog, simply by two minutes' light of the sun-finished. [break] ...working. If there was no sun, then so many ships are standing on the ocean. The cars, they are <span class="Italic">"bong, bong, bong, bong,"</span> so many disturbances. You see? You cannot do anything. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> What you can do? Immediately He can kill you all. Thousands of planets immediately finished. Bring your science to protect them. No, not possible. <span class="Italic">Māre kṛṣṇa rākhe ke.</span> When Kṛṣṇa desires to vanquish, nobody can save you. Finished. Still, these rascals say, "There is no God." Simply rascals. At least expose these rascals. We have no power to kill them, but at least we can expose them. That is also great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Sometimes, Prabhupāda, when we expose them, their argument is, "Oh, you are a saintly person. Why are you criticizing me?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not criticizing. It is opening your eyes. You are blind, you are thinking yourself as very big, so we are opening eyes. You are not big. You are not even pig or fig. That is... <span class="Italic">ajñāna-timirāndhasya jñānāñjana-śalākayā.</span> You are blind with ignorance, so we are trying to open your eyes. See things as they are. It is favoring you. It is not criticizing you. [break]...words, <span class="Italic">vibhu,</span> the great, and <span class="Italic">aṇu,</span> the small. So these rascals, they do not understand these two important words, "God is great; I am small." They think, "I am as good as God." This is the folly. [break] ...English proverb? "Where angels dare not, the fools rush in." Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> "Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the angels, Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, they are offering their obeisances, and these rascals are claiming, "I am God." How great rascals they are. <span class="Italic">Śiva-viriñci-nutam</span> [<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 11.5.33]<span class="Italic">. Śiva-viriñci-nutam.</span> Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā, they are offering their respects, and these things are: "I am equal with God." This Māyāvāda philosophy. <span class="Italic">Mūḍhas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that tendency to be puffed up seems to be so strong, as soon as they get just a little bit of so-called qualification, then they... Everyone is becoming puffed up, even great personalities like Lord Indra and Lord Brahmā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> What to speak of all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Brahmā is also one of the living entities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> So how is it possible that... We're so insignificant, but at the same time we become so puffed up? How is it possible for us...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is material consciousness, that you are nothing you are thinking very big. That is material consciousness. And as soon as you become Kṛṣṇa conscious, you'll simply think, "Kṛṣṇa is great; we are nothing, insignificant." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And so long you think that you are independent of Kṛṣṇa-you are also another Kṛṣṇa-then you are fool, rascal. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti loko mām ajam avyayam</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> That's our madness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Madness. The whole world is going on on this foolish understanding. Therefore they have been described, <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> all rascals. Anyone who is thinking, "There is no God, there is no Kṛṣṇa, it may be He is impersonal, there is no personality, and I am equal to Him"-these are all rascals, fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> So actually there is no way to become detached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The only way is that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Except through Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Mām eva ye prapadyante.</span> You surrender to Kṛṣṇa and everything will be clear, just like as soon as the sun rises, everything is clear, no covering. That is our propaganda, that you become Kṛṣṇa conscious; then you become fully aware of everything. Otherwise you remain rascal, fools, <span class="Italic">gādhā,</span> asses. If you prefer to remain asses, you can do so, but we are servant of Kṛṣṇa. We must preach real, reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> Even the <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> and yogis become...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is these <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span>? They are also another rascal, another edition of rascals. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Therefore so-called <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> after many, many births' practical realization, they surrender to Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> Then he understands that Kṛṣṇa is everything. But such great person is very, very rare. <span class="Italic">Sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ,</span> very, very rare.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> But what about the persons who may be a little bit devoted but who have not achieved that unalloyed devotion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī.</span> They are not devotees, but they are called <span class="Italic">bhaktābhāsa.</span> There is some signs of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Actually they are not <span class="Italic">bhakta. Bhaktābhāsa. Ābhāsa. Ābhāsa</span> means a simple, a little light.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So devotee really means one who has love for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, unalloyed, without any condition. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> zero, all other, that "I am this, I am that, I am <span class="Italic">jñānī,</span> I am yogi, I am <span class="Italic">karmī,</span> I am minister, I am king"-all these are thinking like that, they're all nonsense. "I am servant of Kṛṣṇa"-that is greatness. <span class="Italic">Jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is self-realization, <span class="Italic">ātma-tattvam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> So because that person is very rare, then, I guess, the only way we can possibly know how to become like that is to find one pure devotee and exactly follow that way of Kṛṣṇa consciousness that he has.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dayānanda:</span> I mean to say that because a pure devotee is so rare, the only way must be to find out a pure devotee and exactly follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If you try to find out... (end)</div>
