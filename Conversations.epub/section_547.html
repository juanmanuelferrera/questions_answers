<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is difficulty to understand? If it is not understood, put your question and try to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> In verses like this one, when there is the multi-use of one word, like the word <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is mentioned here to refer to four potential meanings. Sometimes professors and some scholars argue on the point, how do we know which one of the meanings is used in this verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any one you can take, and it will be explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> So any of the four meanings is also the same true meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Sometimes they claim that we should not claim that our choice is the true choice, but they don't understand that any of those meanings can be true at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this body is true. We have got body. We don't say it is false. It is true. Bodily pains and pleasures we feel, so how can I say that the body is false? The body means bodily pains and pleasures, then we are affected, so how you can say it is false? Similarly the mind, and soul is absolute thing. Factually. So any item you take, you can understand by thorough study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In some cases, in a more controversial case, the word chosen, or the meaning chosen for a particular Sanskrit word, may change the whole meaning of the verse, but because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to take the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> meaning. Because we are foolish, we cannot understand properly. <span class="Italic">Tad vijñārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet.</span> Therefore, one has to go to guru and understand the meaning by <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> You cannot make your own meaning. The meaning is already there. But if you cannot understand, then you should approach guru and understand the meaning by <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Sometimes people ask where Swami Prabhupāda get his meanings for different words, because they would differ, they would disagree and pick some other word. But they don't know that you are simply taking the verse and the meaning of the words word for word, as the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> have done.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says. You take that meaning. Where is the difficulty? You do not know, and neither you accept Kṛṣṇa's words. Therefore you remain foolish. You foolishly... First of all you do not know, you are imperfect. And one who knows, you do not take his words. Then you remain foolish. What can we do? What is the answer? You are foolish. So you have to know from others. When we say that you take from others who are perfect, then you will not take. And you are foolish, so remain foolish. What can we do? Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Sometimes people ask, though, they say, "Why is it that even among the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> sometimes we find there is a difference of opinion?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are not <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> They are not <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> There is no difference of understanding between <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> What Madhvācārya understands, we also understand. Suppose you are present also. So there is no difference. What Rāmānujācārya understands, we also understand. What Caitanya Mahāprabhu understand, we also understand. So where is the difference? Difference should be that the fact that he is not <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> As soon as he differs from the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> that means he is not <span class="Italic">ācārya.</span> Otherwise there is full agreement between all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person, all <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> agree. Where is the difference? Does Rāmānujācārya differ from Madhvācārya, or Madhvācārya differ from Śrī Caitanya, Caitanya differs from-no. There is no difference. That is Vaiṣṇava. All the Vaiṣṇavas understand that Viṣṇu is the Supreme. There may be, sometimes, such as Kṛṣṇa is understood as incarnation of Viṣṇu, and sometimes they understand Viṣṇu as the incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> That is <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> But either Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu, He is Supreme, that is accepted by all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So that point is not so important whether Kṛṣṇa is coming from Viṣṇu or Viṣṇu is coming from Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is not important. Because, actually both of them the same, the Supreme. That example we give that candle, two candles, that so far the power of lighting is concerned, both of them equal. Now, you may say this is first candle, I say if it is first candle. But so far the power is concerned, there is no difference of opinion. If I love somebody, I'll say he is first. And if you love somebody, you'll say he is first. But both of them same. Just like devotees, some devotees are very... Hanumanji, he'll never accept Kṛṣṇa. And the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> will never accept Rāma or Viṣṇu. So far the Kṛṣṇa and Viṣṇu, they are all the same. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I think perhaps (indistinct) So actually the differences, whatever little differences may arise, those differences amongst the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are due to different feelings of love for Kṛṣṇa or His manifestations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll find in some, among some devotees, they will criticize, "Why you are worshiping Rāmacandra? He could not save even His wife." (laughter) And some will, "Ah, you are worshiping Kṛṣṇa. He was so fond of women." Like that. In Vṛndāvana you'll find they are different. Somebody will say, "Hare Kṛṣṇa," another will say, "Sītā Rāma." There will be competition. There is not difference. Both of them know that either I worship Rāma or Kṛṣṇa, They are the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? Here it mentions Brahmān, and as I understood <span class="Italic">oṁkāra...</span> My question is whether <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is a representation...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no question about <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> there. Discuss on the verse. But <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is also Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Praṇavaḥ sarva vedeṣu. Raso 'ham apsu kaunteya praṇavaḥ sarva vedeṣu [Bg. </span>7.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "I am <span class="Italic">praṇavaḥ.</span>" So <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is not different than Kṛṣṇa. But <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is pronounced by the impersonalists. That is the difference. Kṛṣṇa, when He says that "I am <span class="Italic">praṇavaḥ,</span> I am <span class="Italic">oṁkāra,</span>" then where is the objection? They foolishly say that <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> is better than Kṛṣṇa. There is no need of chanting "Kṛṣṇa." That is not good. But so far we are concerned, we say there is no difference between <span class="Italic">oṁkāra</span> and Kṛṣṇa. Other systems, Christianism or Buddhism or Mohamedanism, they have got one book, <span class="Italic">Koran, Bible,</span> or... What is the Buddhist scripture? One book. And we have got so many, dealing with the same subject matter. So which is better? Higher mathematics, or two plus two? They should understand the gravity of this movement, my presentation of books. They haven't got so many books. Two thousand years past, the Christian religion has got only one book, <span class="Italic">Bible.</span> And their only pastime of Christ is crucifixion. There is the cross. Therefore it has become hackneyed. People are no more interested. Neither they can explain very nicely. Neither they follow strictly whatever little information they have. Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Next verse?</div>
<div class="Verse">adhiyajñaḥ kathaṁ ko 'tra<br class="calibre2"/>dehe 'smin madhusūdana<br class="calibre2"/>prayāṇa-kāle ca kathaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñeyo 'si niyatātmabhiḥ</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(devotees repeat verse and Amogha reads word-for-word synonyms)</div>
<div class="Normal-Level">Translation: "How does this Lord of sacrifice live within the body, and in which part does He live, O Madhusūdana? And how can those engaged in devotional service know You at the time of death?" [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> ...Madhusūdana because He killed the demon Madhu. But who was that Madhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A demon, it is said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But I don't think we've heard that story before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the beginning, when Brahmā was created, one demon, Madhu, came to swallow him. And Kṛṣṇa killed him. Madhu-Kaitava, two brothers, Madhu and Kaitava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> He came to swallow Brahmā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So he was one of the first demons killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> May we ask questions about pronouncing the Sanskrit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> When the a-h with the dot is in the middle of the verse should it always be pronounced clearly, a-ha. <span class="Italic">Adhi-yajña-ha,</span> or is it more like <span class="Italic">adhi-yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated there. In the verse what it is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> <span class="Italic">Adhi-yaj...</span> Well, it depends on whether I pronounce it right. (laughs) But it is spelled, a-d-h-i-y-a-j-n-a-h with a dot underneath. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adhi-yajña.</span> When we divide the word, then the first noun form is used. Sanskrit grammar is very difficult. It requires twelve years to learn simply Sanskrit grammar. So, that is not possible. So whatever is there, you understand that. Sanskrit grammar is very, very difficult. At least twelve years it requires. And if you understand Sanskrit grammar, then you can read all the Vedic literature without any translation. Simply by studying. Therefore the Sanskrit scholars are first of all taught grammar. And when one is expert in reading grammar properly, then all Vedic literature becomes very simplified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> The Supersoul, does He... I remember in one place it describes that the Lord is so small that He can enter even into the heart of the individual soul, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even into the atom. So where is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> Well sometimes it is described that the Supersoul is situated beside the individual soul. So He's beside the individual soul, not inside the individual soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Inside does not mean He is not beside. We are inside this room, that does not mean I an not beside the room. Because I live within the room, does it mean that the room and myself are the same? Then, why don't you understand this? God may be within anything, but that does not mean that He is equal or one with that thing. That is Māyāvādī philosophy, foolish philosophy. Because I am within this room, does it mean that the room and myself are the same? I am more important than the room. So what is the difficulty to understand? Does it mean because I am within the room, I am less important than the room? The room is important or I am important? Who is important?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> You are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So similarly, Kṛṣṇa may enter within anything, but still He is more important than anything. This is simultaneous. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntarasthaṁ paramāṇu-cayāntarastham-</span>Kṛṣṇa is within and without. That is Kṛṣṇa's position. <span class="Italic">Antaḥ bahiḥ avasthitam-</span>in Kunti's prayers you will find that Kṛṣṇa, "You are within, and you are without, still nobody can understand." That is stated. What is our experience? Within and without. But Kṛṣṇa is both, within and without, and still we do not see. <span class="Italic">Naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā-</span>just like a person playing on the stage, and his relatives and others they cannot understand that Mr. Such-and-such is playing. They are seeing something else. He is playing before them, he is known to them, but he still cannot understand. This example is given, <span class="Italic">naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā.</span> So Kuntīdevī explained this. Did you not read Kunti's prayer? Kunti says, <span class="Italic">antar bahir avasthitaḥ.</span> "You are situated within and without. Everywhere you are." But still the foolish men cannot understand. And why they cannot? <span class="Italic">Naṭo nāṭyadharo yathā.</span> Just like one's father is playing on the stage, but because he is playing in a different role, or dressing in a different role, even the son cannot understand. So what is the difficulty? Hmm? Difficulty is mind; otherwise there is no difficulty. I am foolish, therefore... Otherwise Kṛṣṇa is visible to everyone. We have got two kinds of experience, within and without. He is present within and without, but still we cannot see Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">my</span> foolishness, that is <span class="Italic">my</span> imperfection. We have to become perfect, then we will see Kṛṣṇa everywhere. That is morning <span class="Italic">sādhana,</span> spiritual consciousness, advancement. The more we advance in spiritual consciousness, Kṛṣṇa we'll realize more and more. <span class="Italic">Svayam eva sphuraty adhaḥ:</span> you cannot see Kṛṣṇa, but as soon as you become purified, He reveals Himself. It is not due to you that you can see. When Kṛṣṇa allows Himself to be seen by you, then you can see. So you have to become qualified to see Him; otherwise He is everywhere present, we can't see Him. And without being qualified, if you want to see Him, that is not possible. <span class="Italic">Nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya yoga-māyā samāvṛtaḥ</span> [Bg. 7.25]<span class="Italic">.</span> Find out this verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Paramahaṁsa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ sarvasya<br class="calibre2"/>yoga-māyā samāvṛtaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mūḍho 'yaṁ nābhijānāti<br class="calibre2"/>loko mām ajam avyayam<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 7.25]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"I am never manifest to the foolish and unintelligent. For them I am covered by My eternal creative potency, <span class="Italic">yoga-māyā.</span> So the deluded world knows Me not, who am unborn and infallible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is explained there. He does not reveal Himself. Why He shall reveal Himself to an unqualified person? That is Kṛṣṇa's prerogative. If He likes He will reveal. If He does not like He will not reveal. You cannot by force see Kṛṣṇa. Therefore, first of all be qualified, then try to see Kṛṣṇa. He is not exposed. Even a big man, if you want to see him, he may refuse: "No, I will not see." What can you do? If you think that "This man is third-class man, why shall I see him?" Even in ordinary human society that is going on. So why people are eager to see Kṛṣṇa without being qualified? Why these rascals say, "Can you show me God?" First of all you become fit to see God. They'll not become fit. They'll do all nonsense, and want to see God. Kṛṣṇa is addressed, <span class="Italic">pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān.</span> He is the supreme pure, and we are impure, and you want to see the supreme pure. You see? What audacity! I am not fire. I want to enter into the fire. You see? What will be the result? You'll be burned into ashes. First of all be fire. Increase your temperature to the same temperature, then it will automatically. He is <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma,</span> so you realize yourself as <span class="Italic">brahma.</span> You are realizing yourself as American, Indian, this, that, and you want to see <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma?</span> The foolish people will do. And one has to become purified, <span class="Italic">sarvopādhi vinirmuktaṁ</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to be free from all designations. Everyone, we give more prominence to the designations: "I am this, I am this." So how can you see God like that? First of all you become designationless. As Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, that "I am not a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> I am not a <span class="Italic">vaiśya"-</span>everything He denied. So purify yourself and you'll see God. Kṛṣṇa consciousness means to become purified. That makes you all right. <span class="Italic">Premāñjana-cchurita-bhakti-vilocanena santaḥ sadaiva</span> [Bs. 5.38]<span class="Italic">. Sadaiva</span> means always. This is the process. Why these rascals say, "Can you show me God?" What qualification have you got? He doesn't think like that, that "I have no qualification." He thinks that "I am very advanced." That is foolish. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">nāhaṁ prakāśaḥ.</span> Similarly a third-class man goes to a high-court judge. Foolish rascals has come. "Who is that?" "I don't know." There was an incident. One big philosopher and one big dramatic player. He was also very famous. So he went to se that philosopher and sent his card. He said, "Oh, why shall I see this dancing dog? He may be famous as a dancing dog, but I have no business with him. If some philosopher comes, then it will be a pleasure to talk with him. What does he know? He may be expert in dancing. It is not philosophy." So he refused to see him. "Why shall I see this dancing dog?" He used these words. "He's a dancing dog" (inaudible). So similarly, why this ordinary man claims to see God? A dancing dog? A devotee says, <span class="Italic">marma-hatāṁ karotu vā.</span> A devotee is always anxious to see God, but he said that "I am not qualified. So even I become broken-hearted not seeing God, still Kṛṣṇa is my Lord. I <span class="Italic">may</span> see, or may not see. That is His mercy. But in all circumstances, He is my worshipful Lord." That is devotee. "Oh, I could not see God? I have done so much?" Kṛṣṇa is not so obliged that because by concoction you think you have done something, and therefore He is obliged to come before you and dance. Kṛṣṇa is not so little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> In this connection you have quoted Lord Brahmā, saying that... Lord Brahmā says that the great material scientists, they may be able to calculate the atomic structure of the material world and the planetary system, but even if Kṛṣṇa is standing right in front of them, they can't calculate His potencies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vivekananda liked to say, he challenged Ramakrishna, "Can you show me God?" He said, "Yes," and he showed him God and then he became disciple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They're saying that this Bal Yogeshwara, people ask him "Can you show what is God," and he says, "Oh, yes," then he shows them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where he is now, this Bal Yogeshwara?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> I don't know where he is. There was one article about him recently, but they didn't say where he was. I think he was rejected. Maybe he is trying to start his own movement. But as far as his Divine Light Mission, he is kicked out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kicked out by whom? By mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes, mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mother is authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They say that the main reasons that she gave for kicking him out were that he was going to nightclubs and dancing and drinking and eating meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was doing all, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Yes. So she said, "Oh, he is not Hindu," according to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you cannot be God. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> So she said instead my other son is God. He is very... Also she was a little angry because Guru Maharaj-ji's wife, that American wife that he got, who used to be his secretary-after they were married, in all the temples, their ashrams all over the world, they used to have that Bal Yogeshwara's picture and then his mother's picture. But now they took the mother's picture down and put the wife's picture up. So the mother was very angry. Therefore she kicked them both out, and now her picture and another son is on the altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Another son. So they're accepting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh, yes. He was actually popular anyway, the other son. He was almost as popular as Bal Yogeshwara. He's the older son. He's a jazz musician, so they like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jazz? What is that jazz?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> American music. Something like rock and roll. It is modern music.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. So, how he learned? He is Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, I don't know, but he's pretty good. His band was very popular in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They were very popular. THey would travel around and do performances, and thousands of people would come. He had quite a big group of musicians, and he was the leader. He would lead the whole group. He would play the trumpet and sometimes dance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Then, Ravi Shankar is no more popular?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Most people think he's too puffed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Otherwise how they say he's God? Then? You can stop. Those who are tired can take rest. What is the local time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Amogha:</span> 8:30</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 8:30?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Usually people don't have a very clear idea of what spiritual life is. So when they see someone who is a good musician or a good artist or something like that, sometimes they automatically think, "Oh, he must be spiritual, because he is so good at this. No one else can do it. He must be some spiritual power." So therefore someone like Ravi Shankar, a lot of people either they become envious or they worship him as being an incarnation or something like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also stated, <span class="Italic">yad yad vibhūtimat sattvaṁ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Paramahaṁsa:</b></div>
