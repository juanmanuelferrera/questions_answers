<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> ...Śrīla Prabhupāda, the deputy director of tourism of the government of West Bengal came out to visit Māyāpur. He said that many people have been wanting to see Māyāpur and Navadvipa. And the nearest guesthouse they have is Berhampur. They have a guest house at Berhampur. So they wanted to know the possibility if a bus of twenty-four people could use our guesthouse. They offered thirty rupees a night per room and said that normally they pay six rupees per meal. They wouldn't smoke or break any rules while they go in the building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Let them come. So in one room, one person?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Why not begin immediately?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Also that other man approached, that farm person?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> If we build up enough trade, tourist trade, like that in the guesthouse, then Māyāpur can maintain itself very easily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it. [break] ...of the modern civilization, they are thinking that having such nice house, nice motorcar, nice road, nice machine, nice dress, nice woman, they will be happy. This is advancement of civilization. What is this? Don't drink, don't smoke, no meat, simply denying, denying? This is civilization. They think "This is practical. And after death who is going to take care?" <span class="Italic">Bhasmī-bhutasya dehasya kutaḥ punar-āgamano bhavet:</span> "When the body is finished, burning into ashes, who is coming, and who is responsible?" This is atheistic civilization. [break] ...<span class="Italic">artha-maninaḥ.</span> External energy, that is everything. Within the body there is the soul. They deny it. There is no soul, body is everything, and enjoy bodily enjoyment. That's all. And our philosophy immediately condemns that "Anyone who is in the bodily concept of life, he is <span class="Italic">sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">;</span> he is animal." So this is a park?</div>
