<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why the moon is, particularly rises from the eastern side? The moon, according to the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Scientists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The moon is going round like this. So why the moon is rising from the eastern side? It is going around. Why it appears from the eastern side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They say because the earth is spinning on an axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> 'Cause the earth is turning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's a very good question. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> What's the answer, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you answer. He has understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> According to <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> the moon is not going around the earth. It is revolving around Mount Sumeru. Isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. According <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> that is a different thing. But this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But why the moon should simply follow that same pattern...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...going east to west, east to west? Why not...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Random.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> At random. Sometimes rising from the south.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes, perhaps, from the north.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Well, they say it has a fixed orbit around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It has a fixed orbit around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who fixed the orbit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayatīrtha:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Chance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the sun is also rising from the east. But sun is fixed up, and the moon is moving. So why they are coming from the same side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wonderful question. These are wonderful things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they say that the moon, the moon is actually moving around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And the earth is rotating, and the sun is, only appears to move around the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that question answered?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Well, they both appear that way because of the turning of the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The sun is fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> But the earth is turning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Earth is turning, and moon is turning. But why the sun and moon rises from the same side?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> 'Cause the earth turns in that direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just talk if it is proper answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why doesn't the moon sometimes rise in the south? Or the north?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Because the sun.... Because the earth is not turning in the opposite direction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What he is doing on the roof?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's taking photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, no. This boy joined us.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> ...rather than the chaos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What is the Vedic explanation, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vedic explanation is that moon is not going round the earthly planet. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is very revolutionary thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because children all over the world in schools, they're taught simply that the moon is going around the earth. They shouldn't question it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, they say, "You should not question"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, should not question it. It's taken as fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My point is: if the moon is going round the earth, beginning from here to there, similarly, the sun is also going around earth, because we see the similar way, it is rising and going that way. So how you can say one is fixed, one is standing? The process, we find the same. How you can say that this is fixed and this is going around? Why is...? If the process is the same, then the result will be the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> [break] .... accepted the sun was moving, then they wouldn't be able to prove that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And the.... And the moon is not seen also for fifteen days in the morning (month?). As a layman, we should say that, as the moon is rising from this side and going to this side, the sun is also rising from this side. So if the moon is moving, the sun is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> If that's true, then how does.... What about the changes in the moon's face? Sometimes...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> True or nontrue, I am layman. I am saying that if the moon is rising from this side and going to this side, so sun is also rising from this side and going to this side. So if the moon is moving, the sun is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Common sense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes, I am a layman. Actually sun is moving, but they say fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> [break] ...moving the same, though, the moon would always appear full, and it goes through changes, or phases.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why it, the moon is...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> [break] They say that everything is moving. Both the earth is moving, sun is moving and the moon is moving, but everything has got its own time. Moon is moving once around in twenty-eight days, and our earth is moving around in 365 days, and sun is also moving in its own time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say sun, fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> No, they don't say fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> They say there's a point called the galactic center of the universe, and everything is moving around that point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> They say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that center?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> That they can't find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> Somewhere near the sun. They've just imagined it. It's close to the sun, but not exactly the sun. It's the center, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So our <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says the whole planetary system is moving like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Centering the polestar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> They admit that there's some center of the universe. Everything is going around that, including the sun. But they don't know exactly where it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is polestar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, that's admitted, that the polestar, the stars are revolving around, everything. They take photographs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of the.... Everything revolving around the polestar, the constellations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Are the moon's phases due to the planet Rāhu, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Are the moon's phases due to the planet Rāhu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Space?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The phases of the moon-quarter moon, half moon, full moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Waxing and the waning of the moon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What's it due to, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I should not exactly immediately say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> We don't accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Prabhupāda just said, "Not right now."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But moon is far away from the sun. That is from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, there's another question I have. I remember on a walk.... I have read in your books that the moon's glowing is due to reflecting the sun. Then I remember on a walk in Vṛndāvana you said that the moon is fiery just like the sun, but there's a cooling atmosphere around it. So is it actually fiery glow, or is it simply a reflecting glow?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> It says reflection in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is also a fiery place. But it is because it is far away from the sun, it is not so glowing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So it's not a question of reflection only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The reflection theory is the modern theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because sometimes in the books it's stated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sometimes I have said or taken this modern theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just so that people will understand an example. I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Another question is "How do the different seasons come about-winter, summer, spring?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is due to the movement of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Movement of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Movement of the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say sun if fixed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they say the earth is tilting back and forth like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is always doing, but it takes little time. But the movement of the sun, <span class="Italic">uttara</span> and <span class="Italic">dakṣiṇa,</span> what is their explanation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> They say that the earth is tilting like this. The sun is fixed. When the earth tilts like this in the northern hemisphere there is summer, and when it tilts like this, the southern hemisphere, there's summer. It's tilting back and forth as it revolves around the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tilting?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they say it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Well, they say the earth is on a tilted axis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Twenty-three degrees from the north pole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So, as it revolves around the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's another theory too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's two different theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It's simultaneously going around the sun, and also, in itself, it is turning. And then it's sometimes tilting on a particular axis. It's simultaneously moving around the so-called central sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But for six months that, it tilts?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And then it also spins, the globe spins, and then it also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It has different tilts. It takes different degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The tilt is always the same.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> And when the sun's rays hit the earth at a particular angle, it becomes cooler or hotter. This is their sum and substance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> While it's spinning, it's not just spinning straight up and down. It's on an axis. So it's spinning like this, not like this. Like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> It's on an angle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah. And then it is tilting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But how does that explain summer and winter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because it's close to the sun in...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Because it's close to the sun and.... No, it's not closer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> It spins. Every twenty-four hours it's turning. Why should that matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> No, but the orbit around the sun is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Elliptical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Yes. Elliptical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yeah, for instance, in Sweden, they have a certain part of the year when it is always dark. So they say this is because the earth's axis has shifted so that.... Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So your work is going to begin today? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Jayapatākā Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Pardon?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The work? When will it begin? Begin?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Maheśvara told me the work is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He said some men are coming today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Yes. More are coming today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they are having no difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Seems to be they are enjoying themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> On the whole, the devotees don't appear to be falling sick as they have in previous years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They seem to be well and happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Arrangements are getting better every year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> The devotees are getting better every year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> The devotees aren't eating so much and sleeping so much this year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they don't sleep at all. They get up at one-thirty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Yeah, they're very good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> ...make a suggestion before they leave, have a little meeting, things that could be improved. Then next year we could even make it better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. Yes. Make that suggestion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is the earth also spinning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Or is it simply the sun's movements that causes the day and night, everything?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No planet is fixed except the sun. All are fixed up. But the whole thing is moving. That is <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> And that you can see at night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> What'd he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> No planet is fixed. The earth and sun, they're all moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> The sun is fixed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, but they're all moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But they're all moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is like a tree, just like this. This is moving, and the sun is moving, and all other planets, they are fixed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How is it we see the moon coming in every day, then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> How is it that we see the moon moving?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moon, that is..., of course, I do not remember, but (laughs) the whole planetary system is moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And the sun is fixed, but the whole, it's also moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Sun is also moving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Everything is revolving around that polestar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Everything is moving around the sun, and the sun is moving around the polestar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Everything is not moving around the sun.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Like that tree, if the tree revolves by itself, like that, then the sun(?) is going around the whole thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also another intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The tree is just moving like that, and the different branches, they remain in the same position in relationship to the center of the tree.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the sun has it's own...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So the whole universe moves around. Every twenty-four hours it does one rotation. And then the sun is also round all that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Every twenty-four hours?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, not like that point. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, are the planets shaped liked balls or more like plates? Because it's, it's hard to understand, 'cause they're called <span class="Italic">dvīpas,</span> "islands." Their roundness is the roundness of a plate or like a ball?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The earth planet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is like a tree, then these things can be as <span class="Italic">dvīpa,</span> island.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wow. You know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The scientists are getting smashed to bits by your statements, Śrīla Prabhupāda. This destroys their whole theory. Orbs, round spheres. I think that this Māyāpura building, we must build a big planetarium in it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That, that I am going to do, Vedic planetarium.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, boy. You're going to bring a lot of.... A lot of scientists will come here just to dispute this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Wonderful attraction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> World people will come to see the way the planetary systems...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should advertise it very widely that this is the actual, factual explanation of the universe.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This will be automatically advertised. As soon as the temple is finished, people will come like anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're going to need somebody to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is, on principle, we shall only go against them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Contrary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On principle. Whatever they say "Yes," we say "No." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> What is the explanation of an eclipse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eclipse are.... So that Rāhu planet comes to attack the sun and the moon. And when it comes, it becomes dark.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> How does it attack?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do I attack you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> When we see part of the moon disappear, what is actually happening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Happening, that attack.... Suppose if I come to attack you and if I am in front, then you cannot see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. Like now I can't see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. Just like Prabhupāda's.... I'm standing behind him, and when he attacks you, I can't see you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nanda-kumāra:</span> By the scientist's calculation of what's happening with the revolving, they can predict an eclipse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nanda-kumāra:</span> They can say in advance when an eclipse will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well we can also predict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa: :</span>Yeah. They predicted Lord Caitanya's appearance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Balavanta:</span> And five thousand years ago, in Kurukṣetra, they predicted when Kṛṣṇa went...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So apparently they can predict Rāhu's attack also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Actually, even the scientists say there is astrological reasons behind Rāhu the planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> So they're predicting five thousand years before the scientists. This is the explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, when there was no civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All cavemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...before, there was no civilization.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I just.... I read that recently in an anthropology book, that 3000 B.C. means five thousand years ago, everyone was living in.... Especially in this part of the world, people were simply living in caves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> English propaganda.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They had very crude tools for making their things. Practically they were all like animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how this literature came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Well, they say that it's not older than 1,000, 1,500 years old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One thousand.... But where are other literatures like that, 1,500 years, in Europe and other places?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No such thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So only the literatures were here in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> No, they have them. They also have mythology in Greece, and Roman mythology too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mythology maybe, but so purposeful verses, where is in other country?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañca-draviḍa:</span> Nowhere.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Each rich.... Is it impossible to compose verses by the cavemen? How foolish they are. Not only that, in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> there are 100,000 verses. In <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> there are 18,000 verses. In the <span class="Italic">Purāṇas...</span> Where is such rich literature? If they were cavemen, wherefrom this literature came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They also said Kṛṣṇa was a tribal chief. But how could He speak such philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How rascal they are.</div>

Arjuna said that "I become Your disciple."
