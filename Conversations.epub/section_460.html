<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tolerance. If one is nonviolent, he must learn tolerance.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We pray Lord Buddha: <span class="Italic">Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam.</span> "My Lord, You, for the time being, You are decrying the Vedic authority."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam. Śruti-jātam</span> means Vedic rituals. <span class="Italic">Śruti</span> means <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> It is learned by hearing. Why He decried the Vedic rituals? <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam.</span> You are so much compassionate by seeing animals sacrificed. Animal Killing. <span class="Italic">Sadaya-hṛdaya darśita-paśu-ghātam. Ghātam</span> means killing, so He wanted to stop this animal killing, sinful life. <span class="Italic">Keśava dhṛta-buddha-śarīra jaya jagadīśa hare.</span> My Lord, You have appeared now as Lord Buddha, I offer my respectful obeisances unto you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our... I think picture is there. Lord Buddha's picture.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Not <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (Explains in French the picture in Second Canto)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was Hindu in the beginning. Come on. He was Prince, then He become renounced and He was known as Lord Buddha. So Lord Buddha also started His system for stopping animal killing. Lord Jesus also said, "Thou shall not kill." Unfortunately the animal killing is not stopped. We are therefore teaching our followers: no meat-eating, so that if people stop meat-eating, automatically animal killing will be stopped. According to Vedic system, there are four pillars of sinful life, just like this table is on the four pillars. So one pillar is illicit sex, another meat-eating, another intoxication, and another gambling. So at least the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span>, the priestly heads of religion, the king and the public leader, they should stop these four sinful activities. The leaders of the society they must be sinless. Then the human society will make nice progress. In the Bhagavad gītā it is stated: <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa yat pramāṇam kurute.</span> In the <span class="Italic">'yad'</span> you did not find?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French) (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> When we were at your meeting a few weeks ago, there was, we felt very encouraged because there was very nice interest in how it was that these young western boys and girls had been able to take to this form of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Last night, at the conference hall, this lady heard your lecture about how the soul reincarnates in different kinds of bodies. So she wants to know how is this possible because in the West, our understanding is that the animal forms do not possess a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How does..., she can prove that she does not, it does not possess a soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> She just doesn't understand. She does not say that. She does not understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. She admits man has got soul, and animal has not soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> See, what she says this is the traditional western idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that idea is wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She was open to receive a more detailed explanation of the process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, let us see what are the symptoms of having soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> See, you can come here. Let her come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Ask the lady to have a better seat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> See, there she has a seat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Never mind, we can sit down here. Bring that chair.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Sylvie (?) has a question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> I want to ask you. What does it (indistinct) when you, when there's talk of this religion of Kṛṣṇa. Is it before Christ or more?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This, the question of religion, did it come before Christ or before Buddha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, 5,000 years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> Yes, before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 5,000 years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (translates into French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> 5,000 years, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is now. Before that, this was spoken some millions of years ago to the Sun-god. You find out that verse, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Four, one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Fourth Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">(French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, if you take the calculation of Manu, Manu lives for 72,000 of <span class="Italic">yugas.</span> One <span class="Italic">yuga</span> is 4,300,000 of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 4,300,000 years, one <span class="Italic">yuga.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Multiply by 72. So that is the age of Manu. So, at least so many years before, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> was spoken to Manu's father, Sūrya. Sūrya, the Sun-god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sun-god. So how many millions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> About 120,000,000 years ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this philosophy was spoken 300 millions of years ago. And then again, He spoke 5,000 years ago. This is the history of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Now, your question. You say that animal has no soul, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That a man has soul, you admit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Generally in the West it is admitted that the man possesses a soul and not the animals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why this difference? What difference you find in animal from the man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She says it is only the body that is different.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only body difference? The man who is there has got body different. The, the Africans, they have got different body. And the Europeans have different body. There are so many men. The aborigines have got different body. So there so many men, human also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> So then that is not the real difference?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the real difference, that I want to explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is her reply?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose a child has a different body...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (3):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> This young lady suggests that the animals do have a soul, and that they also pass from body to body, and perhaps ultimately can come to the human form.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is the explanation. You are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> He says the evolution was already before, because in the vegetables is already this process of evolution of the soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Every living entity has soul. The body is just like the dress, just like you are sitting here under different dresses, but that does not mean we are different. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhagavad-gītā: vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni.</span> Find out this, <span class="Italic">vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya</span> [Bg. 2.22]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Second Chapter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take it. <span class="Italic">Vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya, navāni gṛhṇāti naro 'parāṇi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">vāsāṁsi jīrṇāni yathā vihāya<br class="calibre2"/>navāni gṛhṇāti naro 'parāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>tathā śarīrāṇi vihāya jīrṇāny<br class="calibre2"/>anyāni saṁyāti navāni dehī<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 2.22]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">(French) "As a person put on new garments, giving up old ones, similarly, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the point. Just like I've already changed. I was a child, so small. Where is that body? That is no longer existing, But still I remember that I had the body. So I changed that body so many times. Similarly, when this body will be useless, I change to another body. This is conclusion. That is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā: Dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Verse">dehino 'smin yathā dehe<br class="calibre2"/>kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā<br class="calibre2"/>tathā dehāntara-prāptir<br class="calibre2"/>dhīras tatra na muhyati<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span></div>
<div class="After-Verse">(French) "As the embodied soul continually passes, in this body, from boyhood to youth to old age, the soul similarly passes into another body at death. The self-realized soul is not bewildered by such a change."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, not only the animals. The trees, the plants, the insects, the birds, the bees, the aquatic animal: fish. Everyone has got soul. So anything, which has got life symptom, it is due to soul and so long the soul is there the change of body takes place. A child born, if it is dead, the change of body does not take place. You cannot understand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got now a different body, but you had a body like a child, so you cannot understand this? Why is that? Even a child can understand. You were also sometimes a body like this young girl. You do not believe that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She says she can recollect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, but who recollects? The soul. The body is changed. The body is changed, but the soul is the same and therefore she can recollect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> She says there is an example of the worm that turns into a butterfly. It changes body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, she is right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> (French) Do you have any questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says there is an example that a flower grows, and when it dies it gives its perfume to God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, very good idea. Therefore, everyone can dedicate his energy to God. And that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Is the sun to be considered a representation of God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, every..., everyone is representation of God. Sun is more powerful representation. You are also representation of God. The God is also a living being. That is said in the dictionary, Oxford Dictionary. God means, "Supreme Being." So we are all beings, and God is the Supreme Being. We are limited by our power. God is unlimited by His power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (3):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> When we say Kṛṣṇa, are we speaking about God or an incarnation of God? How to define it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, God Himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lady (4):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Then what is the meaning of the word <span class="Italic">ātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means also God. <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means this body. <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means this mind. <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means the soul, and <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> means also God. <span class="Italic">Ātmā</span> means the active principle which is working. Just like in you the <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> is there, therefore your body is moving. Similarly, the active principle of the whole cosmic manifestation is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> What is the meaning of the different <span class="Italic">cakras?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Different?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Cakra, cakras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Cakra?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> <span class="Italic">Cakras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is yogic process. Those who are trying to find out the Supreme from the body, for them the different <span class="Italic">cakras</span> mean the active principle, how He is working in different places. From the abdomen to the heart, then here, then here, then here. <span class="Italic">Ṣaṭ-cakra,</span> six <span class="Italic">cakras.</span> That is yogic system.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (French)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Do we have a meaning, do we have a definition for the third eye?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Humm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> The third eye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Third eye. The future. Future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Future?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Past, present and future.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> There is a philosophy, Śrīla Prabhupāda, they say that you meditate on some third eye, and this opens up into the..., some spiritual realization, a mystical realization. It is very popular.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> He says: today, is it wise to practice this kind of meditation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless. They cannot. It takes very, very, long time to get perfection. Vālmīki Muni got perfection in 60,000 years. Oh, Sixth Chapter. Read this, <span class="Italic">Arjuna uvāca.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span></div>

<div class="After-Verse">(French translation) "Arjuna said, O Madhusūdana, the system of yoga which you have summarized appears impractical and unendurable to me, for the mind is restless and unsteady."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yoga, this yoga system means controlling the mind. But 5,000 years ago a person like Arjuna, who had his friend Kṛṣṇa, he is saying that it is not possible for him. And at the present moment people are so degraded-not in the position of Arjuna-how they can get success? He is not ordinary man. Such a great warrior belonged to the royal family, and so qualified that he could talk with Kṛṣṇa personally, he says that it is not possible. So, do you think that you are..., become more than Arjuna that you can get success?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu Putra:</span> Translating into French.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">(French translation) "For the mind is restless, turbulent, obstinate and very strong, O Kṛṣṇa, and to subdue it is, it seems to me, more difficult than controlling the wind."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is just like <span class="Italic">samādhi. Samādhi,</span> when you become <span class="Italic">samādhi,</span> then if you're, I mean to say, put within the earth, you do not die.</div>
