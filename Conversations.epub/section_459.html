<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes, of course. I have been there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have this festival in very big, in the same scale, in Australia, London, San Francisco, Chicago.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu predicted. You understand little Bengali? Do you understand...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Bengali not... Sanskrit, but not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Bengali words,</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte-</span>this is Sanskrit-"all over the world;" <span class="Italic">āche,</span> "there are;" <span class="Italic">yata,</span> "as many;" <span class="Italic">nagarādi grāma, nagara,</span> "towns...,"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Cities and villages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cities, yes, villages; <span class="Italic">sarvatra...,</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "everywhere;" <span class="Italic">pracāra,</span> "propaganda" or "publicity," <span class="Italic">pracāra; haibe,</span> "there will be;" <span class="Italic">mora nāma,</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu's name. So now it is being so. All over the world we have got branches, and they know Caitanya Mahāprabhu and Hare Kṛṣṇa. Hare Kṛṣṇa movement means Caitanya Mahāprabhu's. So that is being now propagated.</div>
<div class="Verse">pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi grāma<br class="calibre2"/>sarvatra pracāra haibe mora nāma</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So He predicted and by His great will it is being propagated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> How many officials (?) are there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have got about hundred branches, and each branch, there are not less than twenty-five up to 250. So average, if you take one hundred, then it is ten thousand, yes. And all of them are young, within thirty, within thirty. So... And they are trying to understand the philosophy very nicely, even these girls. She knows. In India, even the big, big learned scholars, they are-Indian scholar, I mean-they were surprised when some of my students, the young students, girls and boys, were speaking in Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> You have all been to India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Not all. Some of us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Not all. Some of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have a very big center in Māyāpura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Navadvīpa, the birthplace of Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I have been in Navadvīpa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Long ago in 1936.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1936. Did you see my Guru Mahārāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. He passed away in 1936 in December, in December.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> No, I have not seen him. Probably he was already ill or... He was ill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktisiddhānta Saras... That is the photograph of my guru. His Guru Mahārāja and his Guru Mahārāja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> And so on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is <span class="Italic">paramparā. Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">. Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Find out this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> And how do you...? It was one of your pupils who spoke about Rāmānuja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, Rāmānuja. He belongs to the Śrī-sampradāya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. But there is a connection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. All the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they are connected. Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Viṣṇu Svāmī, Nimbārka. So we belong to Madhvācārya. Caitanya Mahāprabhu belonged to Madhvācārya. Madhvācārya was direct disciple of Vyāsadeva, and by <span class="Italic">paramparā,</span> Mādhavendra Purī. Then from Mādhavendra Purī, Īśvara Purī. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu accepted Īśvara Purī as His spiritual master. So we belong to this Madhvācārya-sampradāya, Madhvācārya-sampradāya or Brahma-sampradāya. The <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> the disciplic succession, is coming from Lord Brahmā. Brahmā's disciple is Nārada. Nārada's disciple is Vyāsadeva. And Vyāsadeva's disciple is Madhvācārya. And from Madhvācārya, Mādhavendra Purī, Īśvara Purī. Then Caitanya Mahāprabhu. Then we are, Caitan..., like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> One of you mentioned, because I had made a translation of the beginning of the <span class="Italic">Śrī-bhāṣya,</span> Rāmānuja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ācchā. Śrī-bhāṣya, Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> No. The <span class="Italic">Śrī-bhāṣya,</span> the <span class="Italic">Brahma-sūtra bhāṣya.</span> Unfortunately, it is out of print.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> So one of you, I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> You can read it in the library, but unfortunately, it is out of print. Yes. It is a complete translation of the first part you see. 850 pages with the text and notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I see. Just like we do text and transliteration?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> The text is in <span class="Italic">nāgarī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> There are synonyms in your translation? Do you give the synonym for the word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equivalent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> His style here. Prabhupāda gives the Bengali...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Transliteration? No, no, there is no transliteration.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Translation, purport or notes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> No, there is only translation and notes. But some of the synonyms are in the notes. And the purport also comes in in the notes when necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You are teaching a course now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I finished. The year is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. You were teaching a course?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Not on this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> What was the name of that course?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> He was teaching the Tenth Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Comparative philosophy, the Indian branch.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> But this year you were teaching the Tenth Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. That was one of them actually, with other courses. But I am retiring, finished, you see. I retire to come...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So comparative philosophy, Māyāvāda, that <span class="Italic">Advaita-vāda, Dvaita-vāda, Viśiṣṭādvaita.</span> Which of them you like? Or you remain simply student? You remain neutral or you like some philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I try to be objective, but not neutral. I have more personal affinity with Śaṅkara, er, with Rāmānuja than with Śaṅkara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Rāmānuja...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Personal attraction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. Although, of course, I try... I have written another book on Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja compared, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> The notions of Brahman and <span class="Italic">ātman</span> both in Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja. That one is not of out of print. It is called in French <span class="Italic">L'Absolute selons les Vedānta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Śaṅkarācārya has accepted Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Sa bhagavān svayaṁ kṛṣṇaḥ devakī-putraḥ.</span> He has written like that in his comment on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So... And all the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> they accept Kṛṣṇa as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So practically, amongst the authorities, Indian <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> everyone accepts Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Rāmānujācārya has written his <span class="Italic">bhāṣya</span> on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I read it. And Śaṅkara's also, both.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya has not written. Śaṅkara has written. <span class="Italic">Śarīraka-bhāṣya, Vedānta-sūtra.</span> He has written comment on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes, and Rāmānuja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya also. Also Śrīdhara Svāmī. Śrīdhara Svāmī he has written. He belongs to Viṣṇu Svāmī-sampradāya. And our Gauḍīya-Vaiṣṇava, Viśvanātha Cakravartī, he has written comments. And Baladeva Vidyābhūṣaṇa, Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Oh yes, there is long list of commentaries on the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There are ten <span class="Italic">ṭīkās.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> This is published?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Where is it printed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It is printed in Japan. And we have our publishing house in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> This is the second volume of the first..., <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> You are familiar with Caitanya Mahāprabhu's philosophy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. You see, I started Sanskrit and Indian studies in 1929 when we were abroad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have been in India several times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Many times, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where did you stay generally?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> In several places, but mainly in Calcutta. But in many other places too.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Calcutta where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Park Mansions, Park St., near Asiatic Society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Park St. Asiatic Society. Yes, I know that. It is just on the junction of Park St. and Chowringhee. Calcutta is my birthplace.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> You were born in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All our former relatives, they are in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Even now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I think the situation is better now in Calcutta, improving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, little better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Because my last visit there was in 1970 and it was the worst moment. But I hear that it is improving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Improving, yes. Just near that Asiatic Society we held our Hare Kṛṣṇa Festival in front of, I think, the museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes, on Chowringhee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and it was very successful. Daily, thirty thousand people were assembling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> This year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. (break in tape) ...God conscious. So the leaders suppressing. This is the present position. The leaders are more or less communists, and they are suppressing their natural outflow and that is the position now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> But I think that nowadays the situation in Calcutta is better. You would not have the same kind of difficulties this year I suppose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is easier now. In 1970, '69 there was no security. When you go out, there is no security whether you'll come back. Yes. You were at that time there? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, I arrived there just after. I arrived in Bombay when that was happening. The Naxalites...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any man walking on the street can be killed. It was the situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Especially any rich man or politician.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> The Vice Chancellor of Jadavpur University was killed the day before I arrived in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Old gentleman?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. And he was retiring. He was still in activity, but he was soon retiring, and he was walking from the University campus to his home, not far, a short walk. And he was killed by one of these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Naxalites.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Naxalites or somebody of the same kind. I don't know exactly. And he was not a politician at all. He had no political activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Still, nowadays, they are having strikes every day, big marches, processions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Oh, strikes, perhaps, yes, but no killings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And just before I left there they had a big strike where some of the younger communist kids, they got out in the street and they stopped all the buses, traffic and told the drivers to leave their cars. They burned a couple of cars and buses. But it is not as bad as it used to be.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Now it is better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Actually, there was no government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> At that time, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> They lacked authority. In Vṛndāvana there has never been such kind of trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And the airport, these international flights, they are not going. They stop only to take petrol, and no passengers going. That has hampered very much India's tourist department. Because no respectable, respectable or nonrespect..., no airlines, just like BOAC and other big, big, they are not going. The minister of tourist department, he has several times requested that "You also come." There are no tourists coming in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Where is your <span class="Italic">maṭha</span> in Vṛndāvana? In Vṛndāvana proper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. You have been in Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where did you stay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I did not stay. I just visited, went around.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> And it was long ago.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is a place, Ramaṇa-reti. Did you see that Oriental philosophical institution?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> It was not yet started at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it was there. 1970. No, when you went to Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> '36 or '37.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> '36? Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> It was not started.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. Ramaṇa-reti, there is a road from Vṛndāvana to, connecting with the road from Delhi to Agra. That road is called Chattikara, Chattikara Road. So on that road we have got our temple. It is locally known as Ramaṇa-reti.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> After Mathurā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After Mathurā. It is Vṛndāvana, Vṛndāvana. There is a shortcut. Formerly... The road is very old road, from Delhi to Vṛndāvana, taking a turn at the place known as Chattikara. So on that road we are constructing our temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Constructing now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> It is ancient? But you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Do you have the photographs?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Some slides somewhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> But that is an old shrine. It is not a new establishment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, formerly I was staying. I have got my place there also, one of the oldest temples, Rādhā-Dāmodara temple. Rādhā-Dāmodara. This temple was established by Jīva Gosvāmī. There are seven important temples: Govindajī's temple, Madana-Mohana, Rādhā-Dāmodara, Rādhā-Ramaṇa, and Rādhā-Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Rādhā-Giridhārī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not Giridhārī. That is later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Rādhā-Gopīnātha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gopīnātha, yes. So Gopīnātha temple, Madana-Mohana temple, Rādhā-Dāmodara temple, Śyāmasundara and Gokulānanda, Gokulānanda. These are old seven temples. Later on, other big, big temples. Raṅganātha temple and Gaekwad (?) temple, like that, Jaipur temple. They came into existence. But there are five thousand temples in Vṛndāvana's city, municipal area. Practically each house is a temple. In every house there is Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa Deity and being worshiped by some devotees. The Ārya-samājī movement... You know something about Ārya-samāja?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dayananda Sarasvati, he made vigorous propaganda against temple worship. Nobody cared. (laughs) Nobody...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Even now, nowadays, now they are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, their influence is gone, Ārya-samāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> No, I mean the Ārya-samāja is no more very active now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They cannot active, because whatever activity they had, they finished. The stock and energy is gone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> How long will you stay in Paris?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am going on Sunday morning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> To Frankfurt.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will stay there one week and then, on the 23rd...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> 26th.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> It will be very hot now in Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now it might be raining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes, it might be raining.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because from 10th June monsoon begins. Bombay is not too hot as Vṛndāvana, as Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> On account of the seashore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. Vṛndāvana is very hot. Vṛndāvana is very hot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> If you go back to India, you can..., you are welcome to stay in our temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> In Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> In Vṛndāvana. We have Māyāpura, near Navadvīpa. And we also purchased some very nice land outside of Bombay. Juhu. Hyderabad and Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> In Delhi also, we have a nice center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> What part of India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's in West End. It is very close to the airport.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> And in Calcutta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Near Park St., Camac St.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Very nice, old... It was called the Ray Castle. It used to be occupied by some governors. (Someone gives the professor some <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Thank you very much. Just a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, during that time of the Naxalites you had mentioned that after that program, you said due to the effects of our program, it stopped all that Naxalite movement. Because very shortly after we had that <span class="Italic">pandal</span> in the Maidan, the whole Naxalite movement was finished. You said due to that, because we purified the atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> ...with chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. The government could do nothing. The police were helpless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> And the festival in Sydney will take a long time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Sydney festival is for how many days?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> On the 29th.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> One day, 29th of June. Ratha-yātrā festival like in Jagannātha Purī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Today it is better here, little warmer. (indistinct) unusually cool for this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> How are you feeling? When we went to visit you in your office, it wasn't sure whether you could come because you were not feeling very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I am not very well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your age?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I got cold.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, age.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Oh, I shall be seventy after three weeks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. I am also seventy-eight. But your health is better than me. You have got your natural teeth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, then very good. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> This is a nice...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this place is nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Nice view. Not too noisy. I wonder how. Because you are on the small street.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Tonight Śrīla Prabhupāda is giving conference at Salle Pleyal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes, I know. Tonight. I have seen. This?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is a picture. I do not know wherefrom they have collected. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It is from Yogeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is supposed that the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are looking to the picture of Kṛṣṇa, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Yes. Very likely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But this picture also appears to be searching out Aniruddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Uṣā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Uṣā, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Yes, that's right. She showed her a picture. Because she had never seen Aniruddha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She saw only in dream. So her friend Citralekhā showed. She showed that "Find out whom you dreamed." Then she pointed out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I remember that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I could not recognize from this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So immediately she brought from Dvārakā-dhāma palace direct to the palace of Uṣā. What is called, the <span class="Italic">asura,</span> what is his name?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Bhaumāsura.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaumāsura, Bāṇāsura, Bāṇāsura. The picture, where is that picture, find out. Bāṇāsura. Bāṇāsura was appreciating, "Oh, very nice couple." But he had to challenge, "Why you have entered my palace and talking with my unmarried girl?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Yes. This is the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa Book</span> that Śrīla Prabhupāda has written. It is a summary of the Tenth Canto. And all these paintings, these are done by our artists in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> I'm afraid I should go now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> Yes. Monsieur La Combe has a course.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Not a course, but a meeting. And as the traffic is rather thick now, it is better not to take a chance. I should not be late.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Professor La Combe:</span> Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> ...on a book. It is accepted as being authentic. All the universities use his texts. And he has a big office in the Sorbonne. The Sorbonne is the most famous French University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a big man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Actually, it's not famous. It's infamous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why infamous. They are famous. Why do you say infamous?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Well, I thought fame is to be referred to for devotee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your sentiment, but practical world, he is a scholar, he is a head man of a department, a university. He must be famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I just saw... Maybe you knew the latest headlines in the newspapers today were "President Nixon is found innocent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">ācchā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They said he was found innocent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. Because, you knew about the Watergate case. He was caught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Prabhupāda knows the story. He knows the incident. He was found innocent by who? By court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, by the whole government. He had done some cheating and campaign making secret tape recordings against the other party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did? And still he is innocent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes. He paid so many millions, thousands and thousands of dollars. His party, the republican party, they put microphones and everything in the convention of the democrats and had spies and everything in order that he could find out their tricks. He had paid all these men and there were all fired.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is not bad because in politics you have to do that. Everyone does so. What is Nixon's fault?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But only he got caught. And all of his men quit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, suppose you are my rival. So I wanted to know your secrecies. So I make some mechanical arrangement. That is not fault. That is not... Everyone does so. Why do you expect that he will not do that? He must do that. If you are my rival or enemy, to know your secrecy, I must endeavor to do everything. As you are doing, so I am.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They were bribing men. They had paid them money and everything to do these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So bribing men, everywhere it is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> According to the American government it is illegal to... Each person has his own plans. And it is illegal to find out the other's. But now they said he is innocent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Court says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> The United States government. They had a big trial and everything. So they found tapes and everything, but there was some missing tapes. They could not directly pin him for the whole thing. He said, "I didn't know anything about it." He says, "My men were just doing it. I never told them to do it. They did it on their own, for me. They liked me so much, they were just doing it. I never paid them."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Isn't the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya</span> qualities that he is to be trustworthy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. When there is political game, everyone does everything to gain his victory. In politics, these things are allowed. Just like killing, fighting, <span class="Italic">kṣatriya's</span> fighting. That killing is allowed. But killing is not allowed generally. Kṛṣṇa has killed so many. If you take from moral point of view, He's sometimes immoral. He has killed His maternal uncle, Kaṁsa, and Śiśupāla, Śiśupāla, his cousin brother. And Balarāma killed Rukma. Once He saved him, and another time, that Aniruddha's marriage, or something like that... Balarāma killed Rukma, the brother of Rukmiṇī. They were family relatives. But there was some misunderstanding in chess playing that other party, Rukma, he was cheating by tricks. The Balarāma became so angry, they killed him. So in politics amongst the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas,</span> these things are not uncommon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But isn't that not good because the politicians nowadays, when they are running their campaign, they say so many lies and everything to the public, that "When I am elected I will do this and I will do that," and they do so many... They pay off so many people in order that they can become elected. So always the good persons are... I guess they also have to cheat in order to get in position, but usually the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we have stopped our political activities. It is not good. It will be hampering to our spiritual understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Because we will also have to do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you want to dance, you cannot be shy. There is a Bengali proverb, <span class="Italic">nate vase guṇṭhana tana</span> (?). You understand Bengali? No. That, "When you are going to dance... A girl, or a lady is supposed to dance in the platform, in the stage, and when she came, she saw thousands of people. Then she drew her veil, what is called, <span class="Italic">guṇṭhana,</span> became little ashamed. So you are going to dance. What is the use of veiling yourself?" So similarly, when one takes part in politics, if you don't take all the tactics of politics, then you cannot gain ground.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> But more and more the people, especially in America, they are seeing how these politicians are cheating. Because every year, in every campaign, the same politician is saying, "I will do this, I will do that," and when he gets into office, he never does anything. But maybe now this time, when our Kṛṣṇa conscious devotees are running and they are showing the people what rascals... Just like Balavanta on TV, he was saying "How can these people be leader, when they are themselves permitting slaughter, drinking, smoking, having illicit sex life."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. That is a fact. But why the leader? The public also drinks. They also encourage slaughterhouse. So if you say to the public that they cannot be leader, then there is no leader. They cannot find out any leader. The public will understand that "I also eat meat, I also drink, do the same thing. Why the leader should be something, saintly person? After all, he is our leader. So we are of the same character. So why the leader should be something different?" They cannot understand it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Therefore we must cheat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Suppose I am thief and somebody accuses you that "He is a thief." So I don't take it seriously because I know, "I am also thief." Means these appeal, that does not appeal because "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." If everyone is thief, if you point out somebody that "He is thief, he cannot be trusted," then he knows that "I am also thief. It is not a big problem. I am also thief." Unless the whole public is sinless, he cannot appreciate a sinless leader. <span class="Italic">Care care mastado bhāi</span> (?). This is natural. If I am thief, so what is the use of accusing you by other, "He is also thief." You'll take that "We all are thieves, all cousin brothers; so why this man should be only accused?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Is it not a vicious circle, though. Without a pure leader, they cannot be pure themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they cannot understand. The vicious circle, they will not be able to understand. Because he is also vicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Therefore just like Kṛṣṇa during the battle of Kurukṣetra, he told Arjuna to do so many things. He told Yudhiṣṭhira to lie. When he said, "Aśvatthāmā has been killed," he said Aśvatthāmā, the elephant, he said the elephant...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that was a tactics. So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And also when Karṇa... Arjuna killed Karṇa when he was off his chariot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The difficulty is, "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss." Better you keep yourself ideal character that people can see that "Here is an ideal group of men." Otherwise, in politics... They are feeling the necessity of an honest leader, but they are themself dishonest, they people. So when you point out that "This leader is dishonest," they do not very much appreciate. There is a story in this connection I will tell you, that one man was drunkard. So his friend said, "You are drinking. You will go to hell." "Oh, my father also drinks." "Oh, he will also go to hell." "My mother also drinks." "Oh, she will also go to hell." In this way, all the family members, they scrutinizingly studying, that all of them were drunkards. You see? Then the man who was accused of drinking, he said, "If everyone is going to hell, then hell is heaven. (laughter) Because my father is going there, mother is going there, my brother is going there, I shall go there. It is heaven. Where is hell?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Heaven is where all my friends are.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is the position. As soon as you point out, "This man is dishonest," and you scrutinize, everyone is dishonest, then where is dishonesty? It is all honesty. Because if the whole business is dishonesty, so there is no question of honesty? Let it go on. That is the public opinion. Why one should be unnecessarily honest? If the whole world is dishonest, and the dishonest world is going on, then where is the harm? What is the use of becoming... The same thing: "It is folly to be wise where ignorance is bliss."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jyotirmayī:</span> That is exactly what people are saying now. They say "What's the use of being organized and good and sane? Everybody is dishonest now."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have to give them a place to go where they can come if they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Parīkṣit Mahārāja gave Kali four places. He could not find out. First of all he gave him four places, that "These four places you can go." But he could not find out such place. So he was embarrassed. So now there is no question of finding out. Everywhere you go, the same four principles. Formerly, it was very difficult to find out a place where these things are going on. Now everywhere you go, these four things are main principles of life. So therefore they cannot very much appreciate these prohibitory principles, that "What is wrong there?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is just the opposite now. Now there is no place where Mahārāja Parīkṣit can go to find out a spiritual atmosphere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some of our men, at least one, left our association. He thought that "This is denying the primary necessities of life." Rāyarāma, Rāyarāma. He left for this reason, that we do not allow the bare necessities of life. Illicit sex, intoxication... He was first-class criminal on this account, but he could not give it up. Therefore he left.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes, I spoke with him in San Francisco, and he said, "Swamiji will not be successful because he does not allow free love in his movement." He says, "That is why I had to leave because there was no place for me and my boyfriend." Even he was not attracted to having a girl, but he had a boy. That boy used to be also your typist. He was from Harvard University.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Neil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, Neil.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And he told me that "Swamiji will not be successful in his movement because he will not allow free love." I just saw him in San Francisco before I went to India two and a half years ago. We were trying to get him to come back to the temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he cannot give up these bad habits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> You said in Geneva that no one has died from giving up cigarettes or illicit sex. So it is not so hard to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is not hard. Now the Christian church is giving liberty, man to man marriage. Most unnatural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Previously they didn't allow divorce. The first principle was there is no question of divorce. Then so many people began leaving the Catholic Church. So then they allowed divorce. And then they did not allow abortion. So again so many people left the religion. Now they allow abortion. And now they are allowing man to man marriage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They compromise just to keep their followers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> It's a matter of money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And that is freedom. So Rāya Rāmānanda left because such freedom is not allowed here. So we have to allow this freedom like the church? (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhārgava:</span> There was one survey done by a college, a university, Michigan State, and Rūpānuga Mahārāja researched it and said 94% of the people in America, they believe there is a God, but only 35% will go to church. They are not very much interested in the churches anymore. They don't trust them. But 94% believe there is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because the church could not help them in understanding God. The Christian church has no idea what is God. Therefore there is no name of God. Actually, they have no idea about God. Is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I was raised up a very strict Catholic, going through Catholic school till I was fifteen years old, but I could not... They were trying to teach love of God, but I could not see that they were also loving God. Even the head priest, he was found having illicit sex relationships with one of the young nuns, and she became pregnant by that and he had to leave. They quietly sent him away without anybody knowing, but later on it came out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is going on everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> And I saw, "What is the point? They are not even loving God." They were teaching loving God, but I could not see it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said that Vivekananda was doing that. You said? Just tell him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> That once I met a little old lady on the streets of Denver when I was distributing books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Old lady.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Very old. She was walking down the street. She was all bent over. And she asked me what I was doing, and I showed her our magazine and explained that we were teaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness, and she said, "Oh, is this yoga? I remember way back when Vivekananda came here. Have you ever heard of him?" So we began talking about Vivekananda. She said that she was there when he made his tour. She was in Denver when he made his tour of the United States, and that he stopped there for one week and lectured. And she went there to see that meeting, but she said that all in all she was disgusted with him because he was so much attracted to the women. She said that he was victimized by the women. They were all trying to get him, and she said so when he went back to India he was a broken man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, he took with him three women. One of them was Sister Nivedita.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Also you told us in India about Aurobindo and Ramakrishna. Aurobindo went also. Aurobindo, when that French woman came, he also fell to her, but just to cover it up he has called her "Mother" because in India, when you call someone "Mother..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone knows he is mother and he is father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah, right. And they don't think... There is no question of sex. When they think of mother and father, they don't think of these things. Also with Ramakrishna. He also had his divine mother. You told us a story in Calcutta that he was very debauched. In a village he used to chase the young women. And his brother actually made him famous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult to, not to be victimized by woman. It is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> Unless you are victimized by Kṛṣṇa first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. One who is, I means, what is called, captivated by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa, then he is not victimized.</div>
<div class="Verse">yad-avadhi mama cetaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravinde<br class="calibre2"/>nava-nava-rasa-dhāmany udyataṁ rantum āsīt<br class="calibre2"/>tad-avadhi bata nārī-saṅgame smaryamāne<br class="calibre2"/>bhavati mukha-vikāraḥ suṣṭhu niṣṭhīvanaṁ ca</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Madana-mohana. Madana-dāhana</span> and <span class="Italic">Madana-mohana.</span> Unless one is captivated by the beauty of Kṛṣṇa he will be troubled by the arrows of the Cupid. <span class="Italic">Madana-dāhana.</span> The Cupid is known. He has got arrow. If it pierces, then he becomes victim.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> You didn't find it necessary to enter into any kind of discussion with this French Professor just now. There was no real discussion of philosophy. I was wondering why that didn't happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not raise any question. And he is simply translator. He has no philosophy. I asked him "Which philosophy you are...?" "So I make comparative study." I think he did not like to enter into philosophical... Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Most of these gentlemen who come here, when they see you and begin talking with you, like you said, they show their ignorance when they begin to speak. So they prefer not to speak. They always make some excuse that they have an appointment because they know that if they speak, they will be in real trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Tāvac ca śobhate mūrkhaḥ yāvat kiñcin na bhāṣate</span> (?): "A foolish man is very nice as long as he does not speak. As soon as he will speak, his foolishness will be captured." So therefore, sometimes they do not like to talk. Remain as a nice man, (laughs) without being discovered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I think maybe the first gentleman who was here, who said... He was talking about experiencing God... He says, "Actually I experienced God, but actually God is beyond my experience." You gave him such a hard time that I think he must have made phone calls to all these other men, "Be careful of Bhaktivedanta Swami. He is very dangerous." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I told him that you have no experience.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He turned so red when you said, "But how were you saying you are having experience, and you just said God is beyond your experience." And then he says, "I never said that. You put those words into my mouth." I whispered in his ear, "We have it on tape. We will play it back for you." (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. We have got Kṛṣṇa. We are not afraid in challenging anyone. I believe on that formula. <span class="Italic">Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> I believe that verse very strongly, that anyone who has not surrendered to Kṛṣṇa or is not Kṛṣṇa conscious, he must be within this list: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñāna, āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritaḥ.</span> That's all. I have explained that verse little elaborately. Read it. It is very interesting. Where is Satsvarūpa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> He is in the other room. Would you like him to come in?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Those miscreants who are grossly foolish, lowest amongst mankind, whose knowledge is stolen by illusion and who partake of the atheistic nature of demons do not surrender unto Me." It is said in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that simply by surrendering oneself unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality Kṛṣṇa, one can surmount the stringent laws of material nature. At this point a question rises. How is it that educated philosophers, scientists, businessmen, administrators and all the leaders of ordinary men do not surrender unto the lotus... [break] ...Manu, Vyāsa, Devala, Asita, Janaka, Prahlāda, Bali, and later on, Madhvācārya, Rāmānujācārya, Śrī Caitanya and many others who are faithful philosophers, politicians, educators, and scientists etc. surrendered unto the lotus feet of the Supreme Person, the all-powerful authority. Those who are not actually philosophers, scientists, educators, administrators, etc., but who pose themselves as such for material gain, do not accept the plan or path of the Supreme Lord. They have no idea of God. They simply manufacture their own worldly plans and consequently complicate the problems of material..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone comes, they say, "Why people are suffering?" They are concerned with the people suffering. Actually not. That is a plea only, as if he has taken the task of minimizing the suffering of humanity. He poses himself as very philanthropist. Actually, he cannot do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> "Because material energy, nature, is so powerful, it can resist the unauthorized plans of the atheists and baffle the knowledge of the planning commissions. The atheistic planmakers are described herein by the word <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina,</span> or miscreant. <span class="Italic">Kṛtina</span> means one who has performed meritorious work. The atheistic planmaker is sometimes very intelligent and meritorious also because any gigantic plan, good or bad, must take intelligence to execute. But because the atheist brain is improperly utilized in opposing the plan of the Supreme Lord, the atheistic planmaker is called <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina,</span> which indicates that his intelligence and efforts are misdirected. In the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like in Paris, these nice buildings, nice parks, nice everything-they require brain. There is no doubt about it. But they have been used for woman and wine. That's all. That is their... He have come. People come to see Paris just for that... What is that theater?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Folies Bergere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And we have heard from our childhood that Paris is a place where people can go and enjoy prostitution. When we were children. I told you last night. So this city is undoubtedly constructed with good merit, but it is used for sinful act... Nobody goes to... Beautiful church, nobody goes there. But beautiful, that theater, because there is naked dance, everyone goes. And therefore <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> Church is vacant. Only the tourists come to see the churches. Not that such a important city, always glorification of Lord is going on. Just like we are trying to do. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> worship the Deity, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That would have been the activities of these beautiful churches, but there is no such activity, because people are <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina.</span> They have got merit, to construct very nice wonderful buildings, but it is meant for sinful activities: illicit sex, intoxication, gambling and so on. And poor women, they are victimized by these rascals. That's all. Then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> (reading) "In the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> it is clearly mentioned that material energy works fully under the direction of the Supreme Lord. It has no independent authority. It works as the shadow moves in accordance with the movements of the object, but still, material energy is very powerful, and the atheist, due to his godless temperament, cannot know how it works, nor can he know the plan of the Supreme Lord. Under illusion and the modes of passion and ignorance, all his plans are baffled, as in the case of Hiraṇyakaśipu and Rāvaṇa, whose plans were smashed to dust although they were both materially learned as scientists, philosophers, administrators and educators. These <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinas</span> or miscreants are of four different patterns as outlined below. Number one. The <span class="Italic">mūḍhas:</span> those who are grossly foolish like hard working beasts of burden. They want to enjoy the fruits of their labor by themselves and do not want to part with them for the Supreme. The typical example of the beast of burden is the ass. This humble beast is made to work very hard by his master. The ass does not really know for whom he works so hard day and night. He remains satisfied by filling his stomach with a bundle of grass, sleeping for a while under fear of being beaten by the master, and satisfying his sex appetite at the risk of being repeatedly kicked by the opposite party. The ass sings poetry and philosophy sometimes, but this braying only disturbs others. This is the position of the foolish fruitive worker who does not know for whom he should work. He does not know that <span class="Italic">karma,</span> action, is meant for <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> sacrifice. Most often, those who work very hard day and night to clear the burden of self-created duties say that they have no time to hear of the immortality of the living being. To such <span class="Italic">mūḍhas,</span> material gains, which are destructible, are life's all in all, despite the fact that the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> enjoy only a very small fraction of the fruit of labor. Sometimes they spend sleepless days and nights for fruitive gain, and although they may have ulcers or indigestion, they are satisfied with practically no food. They are simply absorbed in working hard day and night for the benefit of illusory masters. Ignorant of their real master, the foolish workers waste their valuable time serving mammon. Unfortunately, they never surrender to the supreme master of all masters, not do they take time to hear of Him from the proper sources."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Generally, we see now, especially in the western countries, they are working so hard. The master is wine and woman. That's all. Is it not? They have made their master wine and women. In Paris we see everywhere. On the street they are drinking and talking. In Germany also, I have seen. You have been in Germany?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Amsterdam is the same way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Amsterdam is a place simply for prostitutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is the center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is very prominent in the western country, which we are asking, that no meat-eating, no intoxication, no illicit sex. These things are only thing enjoyable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> They think if you eliminate those, there is nothing left to live for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is Rāyarāma's statement. Yes. I am denying the bare necessities of life. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> Who will try for becoming perfect in this way? Very disappointing. But still, Kṛṣṇa is so kind that helping so many. They are doing actually. All right, keep it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Lord Caitanya's program is so attractive that even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the astonishment. In India, they give me credit this, that "How it has become possible that these European boys, American boys and girls, they have taken to this path?" That they are surprised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> We don't have a very good reputation in India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good reputation that you have become perfectly Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, he means the western people themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "They must be cynic, crazy, another edition of hippies." Like that, they say like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> They think that... They won't allow even a westerner to marry their daughter, because the westerners have a reputation of marrying for a week and then flying away. So they think like that of the people. Even our own men, sometimes the Indian girls wanted to marry the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> the American <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> but the parents would not allow because they said, "After you are married a week, he will just run away back to his country and leave you here." So they are thinking like that about the westerners, that they, the life is so fast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa-kṛṣṇa:</span> Another <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> saved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One of our man has done so. You know that Rāmānuja? The Mexican boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> There's that boy in Bombay he married one Indian girl.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is staying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Jagat-puruṣa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has not left as yet. But he can leave any moment. (laughs) No. He is not American. He is devotee. Therefore he is reliable. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> We have to arrange a few things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the next program? Is there any program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yogeśvara:</span> A big hall meeting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> Tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhagavān:</span> 8 o'clock. You will be speaking around 8:30.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All right. (end)</div>
