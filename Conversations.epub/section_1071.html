<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Christo is also the Spanish and Portuguese word for Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Christ.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Christ. Just see. So write article on this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> "Krishnian."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Wherefrom this Christo came. The Greek word. And the Greek got from India, Kṛṣṇa. This is the history. Christian means Krishnian, godly. And Christo, so far I know, the Greek meaning is "decorated," "love." That indicates to Kṛṣṇa. If there is some scholar he can find out that Christian means Krishnian originally. (reads:) "How the soul transmigrates? The process is very subtle. The spirit soul is invisible to our material eye. It is atomic in size. After the destruction of the gross body, which is made up of the senses, blood, bone, fat, and so forth, the subtle body of mind, intelligence, and ego goes on working. So at the time of death this subtle body carries the small spirit soul to another gross body. The process is just like air carrying a fragrance. Nobody can see where this rose fragrance is coming from, but we know that it is being carried by the air. You cannot see how, but it is being done. Similarly, the process of transmigration of the soul is very subtle. According to the conditions of the mind at the time of death the minute spirit soul enters in the womb of particular mother through the semina of the father. And when the soul develops a particular type of body given by the mother it may be a human being, it may be cat, a dog, or anything." So it is brainwash? Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> But if it was heard by them, they would accept it but because there are so many cheaters and rascals, they're so afraid of all of it because there's been so much cheating and different philosophies and gurus and false gurus and that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) Now... <span class="Italic">Ayi.</span> So for fix up, you should take paper. Who is in charge of which subject, I want to know. (Hindi) That Prem Yogi can teach you very nice. And you and Prem Yogi can teach these boys Sanskrit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not difficult at all. Anyone who knows Hindi, he knows half Sanskrit. Indian language, any Indian language, he knows half Sanskrit already. Half has to be completed. Because Indian language is directly from Sanskrit. So what are the charges you were working? Write each name and charge. Is there any charge to each man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So write that. (pause) This article, if it is presented, the whole case, it is lost...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of this magazine is... Somehow or other, in all the articles there's something about how the chanting is actually producing greater intelligence, clearing the mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Books and devotees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This issue is very important. There's so many evidences. [break] Who are present here...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Who are present here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...their charges, including their... Write the names and the work in which department he's in charge. That I want to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Would you also like to know the... 'Cause some of them are not in charge of certain departments but they work within a department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. He is assistant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then assistant name also the different, these departments. One man in charge and he may have several assistants. That is different thing. (pause) Robinson could not protest any, in any of my statement. He had to admit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yeah. I told you he was very interested in the philosophy, asking some very good questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still he's asking, "Are you saying that we were something else before this life?" I said, "Yes." (laughter) [break] ...issue will help 99% about this controversy, brainwashing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. I haven't read it completely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And there are pictures of chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's a very good..., this editorial.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is new copy. So is it finished now? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">ksena.(?)</span> Practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Finished. So what is your charge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Your including...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Well, restaurant, shop, kitchen, the kitchen godown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kitchen godown?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Supplies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, supplies. So what is the difficulty? The other day you complained some difficulty. So what is the difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Nothing. Nothing excepting my jaundice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Everything is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you said there is some difficulty. All of you came there on behalf...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that difficulty? You are in charge of this department. That's right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the difficulty in discharging your duty? Now you cannot say? What is that? All of you said there is difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It doesn't concern directly what we have as charges.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that difficulty? What is your difficulty? That I must know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> If some of the boys were to get along with the authorities...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Loan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Along.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, along, authori... So that I want... [break] ...discuss with authorities here. Our first authority is Akṣayānanda. So what is the difficulty you get along with? What is the difficulty? You must discuss. Otherwise how it can be resolved?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Personally consulting me, I have had no difficulty so far. But there have been other...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who had difficulty. You came, so many. What is your difficulty? Now explain what you are in charge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> I am the reception.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's the guest house receptionist at the moment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guest house reception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is your difficulty with the authority?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Regarding this guesthouse, everything is okay, but things, little things, these equipments and all these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Help to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I am understanding. He is saying that everything is all right but he needs equipment sometimes. So if they need equipment the procedure is that it has to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Equipment? What is that equipment?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like plates or...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> These bedding materials and these mans for managing these..., sweepers and all. We are running short of mans. Of course we are trying to get short of man...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Short of men. Cleaners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Cleaners and these mans...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have got cleaners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Well, we had sufficient but they are unreliable, paid men, so we're getting new men. But I don't think that's the difficulty with the management.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you solve this difficulty. You answer. He has got difficulty. You answer him. So he has got difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Difficulty is because we lost the <span class="Italic">caukidāra.</span> The cleaner had to become a <span class="Italic">caukidāra,</span> the man here had a new <span class="Italic">caukidāra,</span> so your cleaner is there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Yes, today he is working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And other men are coming, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> Ah, yes, coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is there difficulty now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian devotee:</span> No, it is coming now. There are no difficulties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is the difficulty, I do not find out. You told him and that is already done. And you also said there is no difficulty, so why the other day you all came and there was difficulty?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Well, it was not my, directly my difficulty, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> They have been small situations where other Indian devotees, closer to him, came to me with their problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So all Indians are here. Now say what is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Well, some things like changing of our duties, changing of our services.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why you change? Consult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Well, they're wanting change, Prabhupāda. And they were not satisfied with that change, so, and they wanted to remain in that particular service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Change is no rectification. If somebody is not working he should be trained up. Changing is another... If he is a fool, another fool will come. What will be the difficulty? You see? Change, of course, sometimes required but if you constantly change, the man is not trained up. That practice is not good. If somebody is not doing satisfactorily, then he should be trained up that "You should like this." And if you immediately change another that, that is not actually solution because all our workers, they are not accustomed to certain type of duty. They are devotee, after all. So still, we have to do something, so one man requires little training. But whatever capacity he has got, he is posted, so immediate change, that is not very good management. Let him be reformed and whatever inability he has got, he should be instructed and he should be... And this, all of a sudden change, simply go on changing, nobody... "Rolling stone never gathers moss." A "rolling stone" policy is not good. So what is the difficulty? Keep the stone in a place and it will gather moss. And if you simply roll, it will never gather moss. If the man who has committed mistake, he should be reformed. He should be instructed. Sometimes I show your cleaners by myself, "Do like this." Change them, immediate change, that is not good management, and to make him competent in that way, that is management. So this policy should be followed, not that because he has done something not correctly he should be changed immediately. That will not help. Now discuss this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually we can solve it ourselves. I don't know why they came to you in the first place because our whole business is to relieve you of all problems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should not think that if we are Indians we can have a special access to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do, do. What is that? Ta...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we can do it outside instead of troubling you. We can sit down... Actually, I've already told them since I've been here yesterday that whatever problems they have, we can solve it ourselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go and settle up in that <span class="Italic">lungi.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can settle it ourselves instead of bringing it to Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't think there's any great difficulty, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Actually, we've been speaking the last few days and these problems can be solved.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is Kṛṣṇa's service. Everyone is offering voluntary service. So not that anybody's paid and if he cannot, dismiss or... Yes. This bureaucracy is not... Train him. Train him. If he does not know, train him. But things must be done very nicely by cooperation. That is wanted. Everyone should remember that we are serving Kṛṣṇa, and everyone should remember, "The other person is serving Kṛṣṇa. And because he is serving Kṛṣṇa, he is not my servant; he is my master." That should be always in view. Therefore we address, <span class="Italic">prabhu:</span> "You are my master." We never address, "You are my servant." We are trained up to say my brother, that "<span class="Italic">prabhu,</span>" "such and such <span class="Italic">prabhu.</span>" <span class="Italic">Prabhu</span> means master. Nobody think himself that he is master. He should always think that everyone is his master because he's serving the master. This is our philosophy. So in this way... Now you have got good arrangement and they're all intelligent persons, young persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> All those people are here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So kindly settle up and do nice things. That I want to see. That's all. He is also present. At that time he was not present. So go and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. (devotees offer obeisances)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You should always remember that you are helping me. Without your help I cannot do anything, so you do not be disturbed. Try to help me. That is my request. Thank you very much. (Hindi) (end)</div>
