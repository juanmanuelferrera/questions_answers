<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is London?(?) There is appreciation. And send all these newspaper clippings about us in Hyderabad, how they are receiving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> I had those printed up now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Even the chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Even the chief minister.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He said praises ISKCON.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually Asnani's office is in the same building as <span class="Italic">Blitz.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Make a strong case immediately, without delay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Get a friendly lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Go ahead. Next...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "In point, in Bombay, a huge plot was acquired in Juhu for rupees fourteen <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span> They have put up a temple there with a barbed wire fence around it."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is the barbed wire?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They just put things to make it seem like we're... (laughing) What is the... Everyone is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the barbed wire is there. No <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> editor can go there. (laughter) No rogues and <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> editors allowed. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I heard... Ācārya was telling me when he came from America first in the Hare Kṛṣṇa Land, that <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> editor...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You write this. The barbed wire is there to keep away the dogs and <span class="Italic">Blitz</span> editor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (laughing) Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Then point: At Vṛndāvana, the famed Kṛṣṇa spot, they are on a building spree. Already rupees twelve <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> have been spent on an unfinished temple."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Let them say(?) unfinished. When it was finished it was more than twenty <span class="Italic">lakhs...</span>Fifty <span class="Italic">lakhs</span>. And the temple was opened by the governor of U.P.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We have mentioned that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> And enclose his two letters. He wrote very nice letters. Very beautiful letters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He wishes us all success, and he begs for your blessings. He begs for your blessings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this letter should be... They should immediately be brought into court and charged the damage for fifty thousand dollars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> And this is completely nonsense: "Their major concentration seems, however, to be in Orissa"-we don't have anything in Orissa-"the land of princes and paupers. They have built a center close to our atomic energy commission complex."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A hut center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatākā:</span> Gaura Govinda, he has a few huts. "Major complex."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Besides, they are planning to set up a Sanskrit university in Purī, the home of famed temples and one of the few spots in India blessed by Ādi Śaṅkara. Two devotees, Gurudāsa Swami and Abhirāma dāsa visited Bhuvaneśvara in April last to explore means to set up the university." Then in big heading, "Patnayak's interest in Kṛṣṇa cult."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is going to get us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "They reportedly met also our deputy defense minister, J. B. Patnayak, who hails from Orissa. It is understood that Patnayak has asked the district magistrate of Purī to find land for ISKCON's Sanskrit university there. ISKCON is pursuing not only Kṛṣṇa, it has started taking interest in politics also. It has founded a political party in the United States called "In God We Trust" Party. It has already contested civic elections in Los Angeles and intends to put up candidates for the U.S. Congress." We didn't do anything in Los Angeles. Only in Georgia. All wrong, complete...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is wrong there? In God We Trust, this party. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are making it sound as if it is a political party.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say political with God's name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're not saying God at all. They're saying God..., we're using God as a front.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may say. But we want to put forward a God's party also. Why not? Everyone is godless party. We must push forward a God's party. What is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's not political.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our whole movement is to educate this atheistic godless civilization to God consciousness. That is our movement. So if we set up a party, In God We Trust, what is the wrong there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> In the same newspaper they print naked women. So we have God conscious party to stop this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To stop illicit sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are trying to elevate the demoralized human society to God consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Then, "John Erdman, a U.S. citizen who sails under the label of (sic:) Jayapak Swami and is in charge of the flourishing Māyāpura complex of the Society, recently had discussions with his chums to set up an In God We Trust Party in India also." Then, heading: "Bigger Than Defunct British Empire." "In a recent communication with Gargamuni Swami, alias Gregory M. Scharf, who looks after West Bengal, the chief from headquarters says, "Now we have become more than the British Empire"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is your quote.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what is British Empire? British Empire could not occupy the whole world. We are occupying the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But what they've done is they opened a newsletter which Rāmeśvara Swami sent. And it must have been addressed to Gargamuni Swami. They must have stolen it from the postman by giving him two rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. We are trying to expand our empire, and it is already done all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "Now we've become more than the British Empire. Even the British Empire was not as expansive as we are. They had only a portion of the world, and we have not completed expanding. We must expand more and more unlimitedly."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You also explain, that British Empire expanded by military strength. And we are expanding by <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā.</span> We are expanding our empire simply by <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> East meets West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Singing, dancing and chanting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We introduce three chariots in big, big cities, and conquered them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> "Rival to Nelson's Column."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We are marching through the streets not with guns.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They admitted, "Rival to Nelson Column" in <span class="Italic">Guardian</span> even. So who is strong enough? We are stronger than British Empire. Simply by <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā</span> we are conquering. And actually that is being done. What I have got strength? Forty rupees beginning. Simply Hare Kṛṣṇa and <span class="Italic">Ratha-yātrā,</span> that's all. That's a fact. They can see, they have got eyes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The Indian government has been rather slow in picking up the ISKCON signals. One reason being that the genuine Kṛṣṇa devotees in the administration had been mighty pleased in the beginning with the idea of exporting Kṛṣṇa consciousness to America."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Genuine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means the genuine ones are here in India, and they were pleased with the idea of exporting Kṛṣṇa to America. So that means that the ones in America are not genuine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So "You are not genuine. Therefore we are not appreciating." Genuine they appreciate. "But you are not genuine. Therefore we are criticizing you."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "As far back as 1971 the Maharastra government had taken action against the foreign devotees who had chosen to overstay in Bombay and elsewhere."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> That isn't true. Their action was to allow us to build our Bombay center.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that's not true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "In mid 1975 the Union Home Ministry took, however, a lenient view and allowed the immigrants to stay for long periods on the specious plea that the mastering of Vaiṣṇava literature, the spiritual diet of the cultists, was not like learning shorthand." Then heading: "Contrary Pulls in Government." "Lately, of course, the center has become wise, though contrary pulls in the thinking process still persist. This was quite evident at the Raj..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This article no sane man will take notice of it. No sane man will like. It is not very important article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Trouble is, we're in a land of insane people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's the largest circulating newspaper in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. So bring him into court. But what will be your charges?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, slander, it was trying to slander our character, our whole movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Defamation of our religious cult. Because we're recognized by scholars as being bona fide. It says here, "Ungodly face of Kṛṣṇa cult." How is that ungodly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is the charge. They are trying to minimize our...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We are godly. There are so many quotes from big scholars.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just at the end this article gets worse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that very heading is a defamation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> "We challenge you that you are ungodly. But we are godly because we follow the four principles." This man drinks, it shows a photo of him drinking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Ungodly face of Kṛṣṇa cult." This is the charge. That very heading is a defamation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also the information that he has put to substantiate that is bogus. And we'll prove point by point how it is bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We should charge them "ungodly." "Ungodly face." This should be charged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And also that these charges...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Others are subordinate. This is the main charge. We are spreading Kṛṣṇa, God, and he's "ungodly face." Minimizing the value of the movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Defamation of character.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So immediately you send letter to Asnani.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I will write him right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, I will... No more</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Give it to me now. But Girirāja told me there was some... He doesn't want to hear anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh. You don't want to... There's only just a last little bit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But now they have requoted what was in the paper about what you know already, that thing that came up in the Parliament.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you quote from all these quotations. <span class="Italic">Ananda Bazaar</span> and others. You give quotations. They may make a fresh pages so when court case is there this should be presented.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes. Newspaper articles can stand as evidence because the <span class="Italic">Ananda Bazaar,</span> they sent a whole team there, and the article they wrote was fantastic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have to give me all of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They're here on Prabhupāda's desk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> No, Harikeśa has got them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So go and pick up and make arrangement immediately show them. One thing, that we have got this <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilā.</span> So if you like to personally worship, we can keep it. Otherwise I am sending to Bombay. Do you like to worship?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We can take with us? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is good to take with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> We can make small thing like you used to have, small Deities? We can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Make a small box.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Here there are carpenters. We can get it made before you leave.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we can carry and every morning just put in a <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana</span> and <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> and water and flower and little fruit. That's all. He has got tendency to worship.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Paṇḍita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitjī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He and Nitāi are both considered the <span class="Italic">paṇḍitjīs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they are <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He is training his son also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, his son will be great <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span> Both of them are devotees, husband and wife. Therefore nice son is born. <span class="Italic">Yathā bījaṁ yathā yoni. Yathā bījaṁ yathā yoni. Yoni</span> is the mother. <span class="Italic">Bījam</span> is the father. <span class="Italic">Yathā bījaṁ yathā yoni.</span> So I'll not send it to Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. Okay. Good. It's better to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My father used to carry <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-śilā</span> if he was going out in the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the neck?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His Guru Mahārāja advised him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's auspicious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is the safest place. In a linen handkerchief, bound up. Yes. So it is safe always, <span class="Italic">kaṇṭha.</span> My father used to carry. Wherever he would stay, <span class="Italic">gaṅga-jala, tulasī,</span> decoration. Say, half an hour business. My father was a great devotee. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You dedicated the <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> book to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because he was a pure Vaiṣṇava. And he wanted me to become like this. He was praying Rādhārāṇī. He was praying to Rādhārāṇī. And any saintly person would come, he would simply say, "Give blessings to my son that he may become a Rādhārāṇī's servant." That was my father's prayer. He never prayed that "My son may become very rich man." He never prayed like that. Actually, his ardent desire that his son may become a Vaiṣṇava. And my Guru Mahārāja's training has put me this position. That I have admitted. Later on. What is that word I have given? Hmm? Find out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> "The eternal father?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Which was later on solidified..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ahh!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "...by my eternal father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "The ideas given by my father were solidified by..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's what you said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> "To my father, Gour Mohan De, 1849-1930, pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, who raised me as a Kṛṣṇa conscious child from the beginning of my life. In my boyhood ages he instructed me how to play the <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga.</span> He gave me Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">vigraha</span> to worship and he gave me Jagannātha Ratha to duly observe the festival as my childhood play. He was kind to me, and I imbibed from him the ideas later on solidified by my spiritual master, the eternal father."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very beautifully written.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Yes, very poetic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a fact. I got good father and good spiritual master. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> We have gotten bad father, but now we have spiritual father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No bad father. Unless good father, son cannot be good. <span class="Italic">Yathā yoni yathā bījam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They must be just fallen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> They have not accepted your mercy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They'll all benefit by the son's devotional service. It doesn't matter how fallen they are, you know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My father never chastised me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think you said your mother was always very strict.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he was very lenient. So mother had to be little strict for my education. So prepare a case for these rascals. We have got strong case. And charge, "Why you have made 'ungodly'? Prove it. What do you know about godly?" Charge them. So there will be discussion, long discussion, what is godly and what is not godly. Put them in the corner. "What do you know, rascal, about godly tradition? You have charged us, 'ungodly.' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> He's a drunkard, that man. That editor, he drinks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a Parsee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Charge in the court, "What do you know about godly that you have charge us ungodly." Then it will be exposed. Do, immediately do. Immediately plan to bring in the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, in the same newspaper they were doing a whole thing about Sai Baba. They had a big article about Sai Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're supporting him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Supporting him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which newspaper, this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, this paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sai Baba has a very big political following, including the chief minister of Bombay also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gargamuni:</span> Home Ministers, Home Ministers wear his ring, Sai Baba ring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So I think they're doing it just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't touch about Sai Baba. We charge him, "What do you know about godly?" Don't bring any other men. Don't try to become that "All are useless, we are important." No. But whatever they are there. But they have directed "ungodly." "What do you know about godly, that you have said as ungodly?" Let him explain. And we are background <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> approved. So why you are taking my pad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, I'm sorry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the, our member. Pencil and pad. Either he'll leave his own pencil or take my pencil. (laughter) That I am observing. All right. Go. So you'll take charge of this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, I will come get it later. I'll get some silk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And purchase one <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana,</span> small. You know small <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And some fine cloth. And you can decorate with this <span class="Italic">gopī-candana.</span> That's all. And make a small linen <span class="Italic">dhoti</span> and <span class="Italic">cādara,</span> and flower and <span class="Italic">tulasī.</span> That's all. And you have got that pot water, <span class="Italic">pañca-pātra. Bas.</span> That's all. <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalam.</span> We have got the picture of Advaita Prabhu offering. The same thing here. Where is that picture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That is in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> Must be <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Where did He come from, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Sampat Bhaṭṭācārya.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, the South Indian <span class="Italic">paṇḍita.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are pleased with us. Otherwise, he would not have given.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Their culture is dying in India. No one wants <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> anymore. But we are the only ones who are encouraging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You must encourage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Other, all young men... <span class="Italic">Paṇḍitas...</span> That book isn't here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Teachings of Lord Caitanya?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Oh, maybe. No. It must be in <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā,</span> first volume.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ādi-līlā</span> is not here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They took first volume. They don't have all the books here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They should be charged, "Why you have said 'ungodly face'? What do you know about God?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The courts can take it up also. In Allahabad when they were doing about the Congress Party having the cow, they said this is of the nature... They were discussing what is God in the court to make a decision. Something, what is God, what is religion. We can bring it up in the court. That will make a case <span class="Italic">celebre.</span> Case <span class="Italic">celebre,</span> they call it, <span class="Italic">affaire celebre.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This case must be brought. Challenge them, "What do you know about God?" Explain. And we can prove God consciousness from every page of our books. That will be very interesting case. And we shall continue this unless this man is sufficiently fined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is a... That bit about... Some of it, there's the front page also. Thought you might like to read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Evidence of fraud"? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's Sai Baba.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> One man is trying to prove Sai Baba is fraud. One professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's a scientist. He says he can prove that Sai Baba's making things appear and disappear is just a trick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is a fraud. What is this paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This is the same issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> But there's something very interesting. When he manifests something, he gives evidence, he says, "This cannot be a creation, because to be a creation, to be God you must be creator. To be creator you must produce something which is uniquely not made by anyone else." So he said he's only making things that are already created by someone else-a watch. So he is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's producing a watch, then it's a watch that's made by some manufacturer. It's not made by Sai Baba. Like that. So there was a comment that even if he has some... He may have some supernatural power, but he's not God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> He has some yogic <span class="Italic">siddhi,</span> but he cannot be God because he does not create.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this paper is against Sai Baba also?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No. On the front page it says... Because he is doing a lot of educational... He has made all these universities and health centers and everything. So it says that he is doing good to the people. So for that reason they said, "We don't want to see him criticized."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're supporting him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the case is already in the court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> No, it is just a challenge. The Bangalore University, some people at Bangalore University want to investigate his things. And then Sai Baba sometimes, he won't submit to be examined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He submits?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They want to have him come and examine him, that, "Do it and let us see." But he won't admit to be examined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Some U.S. men, though, they gave a report that whilst they were talking to him he made different things appear and disappear. They wanted to examine him, and he wouldn't allow it. But during the course of the conversation he made several things appear and disappear. Like he produced this type of nut that comes from Nepal. It just appeared in his hand. And then he closed his hands and opened them up again and the nut, the same nut was there. But this time with some gold, a gold cross hanging from it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> A <span class="Italic">Rudrākṣa.</span> Some rare kind of <span class="Italic">Rudrākṣa.</span> Then made it appear again with all gold, and then he gave it to the man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And then he produced gold ring and stuff like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is magic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Still, even if he can do those things, it's only mystic <span class="Italic">siddhi.</span> That doesn't mean to say he's God or an <span class="Italic">avatāra</span> or anything. But these people are so foolish they think anybody with a little magic, he must be <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> They worship him as God. "Bhagavan Sai Baba."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, we must bring this man charges. "Ungodly face."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Just like it says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> they think religion is irreligion...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Ungodly face," what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "The ungodly face of Kṛṣṇa cult."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that ungodly face?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They're trying to make out we're political.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That we... He said he has "Now unmasked the ungodly face of Kṛṣṇa cult." That we're putting on a false face of being devotees of Kṛṣṇa, but actually we have an ungodly purpose. That we want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What ungodly we have done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> That he does not come out and say, but he implies that we are foreign, that we want to exploit India somehow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, they are feeling the weight. Now they are feeling the weight. That is the progress. Otherwise, if our movement would have been a trifle thing, the government and newspapers they would not have taken care. Now they are feeling that this movement is going to be more and more important, all over the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can see we're having an effect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> The more we go with these traveling parties also, from town to town.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Most of the general population, they're already convinced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First thing is that when you take <span class="Italic">śālagrāma-sevā,</span> wherever you stay, this worship must go on daily.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">nitya-pūjā, nitya-sevā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you cannot... One day, if you are sick, your wife will do that. But that half an hour <span class="Italic">pūjā</span> must continue. That you must decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> Yes. Yes. I saw those <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> in Udupi, they will never fail to do it under any condition. They have little box with <span class="Italic">śālagrāma,</span> little <span class="Italic">śaṅkha,</span> little thing, little <span class="Italic">tulasī</span> leaf they get. They will do that every day daily. They cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So both of you are initiated. In case you are little sick, your wife will do. In that platform you have to do it. <span class="Italic">Sevā</span> shall not be stopped. Gradually as your son grows, he will also do it. So you can purchase one little <span class="Italic">siṁhāsana.</span> That is available in any utensil shop. All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda. (end)</div>
