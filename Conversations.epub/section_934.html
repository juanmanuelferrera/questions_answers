<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...cure the diseased condition of our existence, and then it will be cured. For that purpose, we have to execute austerity, penance, <span class="Italic">tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena ca [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> These practices are there. But there is one practice that is called <span class="Italic">bhakti. Kevalayā bhaktyā vāsudeva-parayanaḥ.</span> One.... <span class="Italic">Vāsudeva-parayanaḥ, vāsudeva sarvam iti sa mahātmā su-durlabhaḥ.</span> When one understands that Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, is everything, then he becomes the greatest <span class="Italic">mahātmā.</span> That platform is achieved after many, many births. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyate vāsudeva sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> So Vāsudeva is canvassing, <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> [Bg. 18.66] "You just surrender to Me, I shall give you all protection." And one has to come to this position, <span class="Italic">vāsudeva sarvam iti.</span> So one who is intelligent, he will take it immediately that <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">,</span> "After many, many births, if I have come to this position, that 'Vasudeva is everything,' then why not accept Him immediately?" That is intelligent. Why shall I wait for many, many births? I have got now sense, I have got this human body. Let me do it immediately. That is sense. And if you want to wait for many, many births to come to this conclusion.... We can do that. That is our misfortune. So our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is that you take immediately, without waiting for many, many births. Don't wait. Now we have got human form of body, and here is opportunity, <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> to take shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Why not do it now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> And it is sure to go through in this life if you try this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is sure. He says <span class="Italic">ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ.</span> It is sure. It is not speculation. It is fact. As soon as you surrender, you immediately become freed from all sinful reaction of life. And we suffer on account of sinful reaction of life. So intelligence is that "Here is the opportunity, <span class="Italic">mām eva ye pradadyante māyām etāṁ taranti te,</span> to get out of the clutches of the influence of material energy. Why not take it now?" That is wanted. <span class="Italic">Vāsudeva sarvam iti sa mahātmāh su-durlabhaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1) (Indian man):</span> When you talk of Kṛṣṇa, sometimes when we talk with our friends here, to ask you this thing, when you talk of Kṛṣṇa, do we mean that we are talking of Kṛṣṇa of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> or we are talking of the Kṛṣṇa the God, or the supreme head?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and Kṛṣṇa God is the same person. Why do you differentiate? My question will be how do you differentiate the Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and Kṛṣṇa God different? Because Kṛṣṇa is speaking <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is a chapter in the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> So how do you differentiate? What is the cause that you are differentiating?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Well, I think that the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you think you have already explained. But where is the basis of your thinking like that? Because everyone knows the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> battle was there, Battle of Kurukṣetra, that is a chapter in the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> And Kṛṣṇa is the speaker in that Battle of Kurukṣetra and Arjuna is the fighter. How do you take away the Kṛṣṇa of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> from the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra? What is your reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, that is all right. Kṛṣṇa, we call... But do we take it, do you take it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to take it, because there is no difference. As soon as you bring in <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and Kṛṣṇa, the Kṛṣṇa is the same. You cannot take it differently. Because Kṛṣṇa is speaking to one of the parties of the fighters, the Kurus and the Pāṇḍavas, and that is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā. Dharma-kṣetre kuru-kṣetre samaveta yuyutsavaḥ [Bg. 1.1]. Yuyutsavaḥ</span> means two parties desiring to fight. Who are those parties? <span class="Italic">Māmakaḥ pāṇḍavāś caiva [Bg. 1.1].</span> That is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> history. So how you can differentiate this Kṛṣṇa, that Kṛṣṇa? There is no possibility, it is imagination. The beginning is <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2) (Indian man):</span> Swamiji, excuse me for this, I read an article recently. One of my secretaries he brought that article to me, it was written by Dr. Bannerji in India-he's a professor at Calcutta University. And he says that Kṛṣṇa and the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> the Kurukṣetra, that is all a visionation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is his foolishness. He's a fool. He does not know the facts, and he has posed himself as a learned scholar. That is the difficulty-fools and rascals presenting themselves as scholar and misrepresenting. People are being misguided. Because he is a learned scholar, you are citing his example. But he is a fool. He does not know what is <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> what is Kṛṣṇa. And still, he wants to say something, that is his foolishness. He does not know, and still he wants to speak something. That is cheating. The cheating propensity is there for conditioned souls. He does not know one thing, still he wants to speak as an authority. That is cheating. How you can differentiate? If you are actually student of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> then how we can differentiate the speaker in the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra and Kṛṣṇa? Kṛṣṇa is accepted there as Bhagavān. Whenever Vyāsadeva writes Kṛṣṇa statements, he writes <span class="Italic">bhagavān uvāca.</span> He's Bhagavān, as well as He's a historical person in the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> He never writes <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa uvāca,</span> he writes <span class="Italic">bhagavān uvāca.</span> And Arjuna admits, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān puruṣam ādyam</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">,</span> "You are the Supreme Person." How can you differentiate Kṛṣṇa of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and Kṛṣṇa of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa...? These are miscalculations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No, sir, we didn't say Kṛṣṇa of <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span>; we said that when you read the Vedic literatures, there comes some <span class="Italic">nirguṇa-brahman</span> and <span class="Italic">saguṇa-brahman.</span> Now my question...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahman.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, but my plain feeling came, sir...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, the Brahman, there are... We are all Brahman, living entities. We are simply thinking "I am this body." So when we are... That I was speaking, liberation. When we come to the conclusion that "I am not this body," <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi...</span> So you are already Brahman, but you are, forgetfully, you are thinking that you are Indian. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> We are all Brahman, but due to our ignorance, lack of knowledge, we are thinking "I am Indian," "I am American," "I am Hindu," "I am Muslim," "I am Christian," "I am this," "I am that." That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So when you actually understand that "I am not this body; I am spirit soul," that is the fact. Then that condition is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ.</span> Now we are <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūtaḥ.</span> We are thinking "I am individual person of this country, of this religion." That is <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūtaḥ.</span> But when we understand that we are not <span class="Italic">jīva-bhūtaḥ,</span> we are <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> that is our liberated position. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> When one becomes actually in understanding that "I am not this body, I am spirit soul," then my all responsibility of this bodily condition immediately ceases. I am not this body. And why I am working for this body? Why I am in ignorance? That is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is liberated stage. So we are already Brahman, there is no question of becoming Brahman. We are mistaking something else, that "I am not Brahman." So when we come to the actual understanding, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi,</span> that is called <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūtaḥ</span> stage. <span class="Italic">Brahmā-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā na śocati na kāṅkṣati samaḥ sarveṣu... [Bg. </span>18.54]. Then he see everyone on equal level, that every soul is Brahman.</div>
<div class="Verse">vidyā-vinaya sampanne<br class="calibre2"/>brāhmaṇe gavi hastini<br class="calibre2"/>śuni caiva śva-pāke ca<br class="calibre2"/>paṇḍitāḥ sama-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 5.18]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">That is <span class="Italic">sama-darśinaḥ.</span> He sees the same soul within a learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> and within a dog. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span> That is the stage of <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span></div>
<div class="Verse"> brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate param<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"> So when you come to the standard of <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> then you can understand Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Unless you come to that stage, you cannot understand Kṛṣṇa, you will mistake. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye [Bg. 7.3].</span> This <span class="Italic">siddhi</span> means to become liberated from the bodily concept of life. So out of many millions of people, one gets the opportunity of becoming <span class="Italic">siddha, brahma-bhūtaḥ,</span> and <span class="Italic">yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ [Bg. 7.3].</span> And those who are <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> liberated, out of many of them, <span class="Italic">kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ.</span> So how this Mr. Bannerji will understand Kṛṣṇa? He is not a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> he cannot understand. He can talk of the honey within the bottle. He cannot taste it. If he wants to taste, somebody must be able to open the bottle and give him little. Then he'll get. Otherwise, let him lick up the bottle. (laughter) That's all. So those who are licking the bottle, they cannot say what is the taste of the honey. One must actually taste. That is possible, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">,</span> that taste is available by the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> not by the so-called scholars. That is not possible. <span class="Italic">Nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyaḥ.</span> That is Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Na medhayā, na bahunā śrutena.</span> You cannot realize self by your intelligence or by your learning or by your brain. <span class="Italic">Nāyam ātmā pravacanena labhyaḥ na bahunā śrutena.</span> So when the <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> Paramātmā, reveals Himself to somebody, he can understand. And that revelation is possible when you are a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Otherwise, it is not... It clearly says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> It never says "By brain, one can understand." Never says, "By speculation, one can understand." No, this is not the process. <span class="Italic">Bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the beginning, He said <span class="Italic">kaścin vetti māṁ tattvataḥ. Yatatām api siddhānām [Bg. 7.3].</span> Those who are <span class="Italic">siddhas,</span> already liberated, out of them, many, many, still, they are unable to understand, <span class="Italic">tattvataḥ,</span> in truth. But here He says, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti yāvān yaś cāsmi tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> Only through <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> one can understand in truth what is Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise it is not possible. Because one is scholar he can understand Kṛṣṇa, that is not the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> But this paradox which is existing mostly in <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> terms, that the form of the God is <span class="Italic">neti neti,</span> and they say that whichever people like Rāma and Kṛṣṇa, they call it, is a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say! What they say, they have no value. Because if it is a fact that one can understand God through <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> so whatever <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> says, that is value. What a nonsense says, it has no value. It has no value. "They say." First of all, you have to think what they are. Are they speculator or <span class="Italic">bhakta</span>? Just like beginning of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si,</span> "I am talking to you <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> because you are My <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span>" So it is the subject matter..., <span class="Italic">bhagavān</span> is the subject matter for the <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> not for others. Others, they will speculate only. They will never understand what is Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3) (Indian man):</span> Yesterday you said:</div>
<div class="Verse">yadā yadā hi dharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>glānir bhavati bhārata<br class="calibre2"/>abhyutthānam adharmasya<br class="calibre2"/>tadātmānaṁ sṛjāmy aham<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>4.7]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is <span class="Italic">dharmasya glānir.</span> That those who are not <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> speculators, they are talking of God. This is <span class="Italic">dharmasya glānir.</span> How they can talk of God? They cannot talk. Even they are talking, that is misleading, because nobody can talk of God unless you are devotee of God. You see? <span class="Italic">Bhakto 'si.</span> Fourth Chapter. The subject matter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is to be understood by a <span class="Italic">bhakta,</span> not by a speculator. Read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Sa evāyaṁ mayā te 'dya yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ</span> [Bg. 4.3]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, "I am just talking to you that <span class="Italic">purātanaḥ,</span> old yoga system, which I spoke to the sun-god." "Why you are talking to me?" Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakto 'si me...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhakto 'si me.</span> He was not a Vedantist, he was a soldier. How the soldier can understand the highest topics of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span>? <span class="Italic">Imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam</span> [Bg. 4.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is the yoga. How a soldier... Arjuna was not a Vedantist, he was a fighter. There was a doubt that "How a soldier can understand?" Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bhakto 'si,</span> "You can understand because you are My <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span>" The first qualification, one must be a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> Then he can understand. Otherwise it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> How then can the God come in a human form, because human, when you talk of human body, it is a limited...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He does not come in human form. He is <span class="Italic">like</span> human being, <span class="Italic">dvi-bhuja.</span> That is also explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> He's... In the <span class="Italic">Bible</span> it is said that man is made after God. The human being, two hands, two legs, this body they have got, that is the original form of God. But because He comes in that form, <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> they think that He is a man. His original form is (like) that. But because we are habituated to see two hands, two legs of human being, we take Him as human being. But that is His original form. <span class="Italic">Avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā.</span> Find out. So if we accept Him as a human being like us, then we are <span class="Italic">mūḍhā,</span> rascals. He says <span class="Italic">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto [Bg. </span>9.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know what is behind this human form. God is omnipotent, almighty. He can take any form He likes. You cannot check Him. You cannot say "How Brahman can come in a human form?" Why He cannot come? If He is all-powerful, where is the difficulty? Taking your argument, if Brahman is all-powerful, then where is the difficulty for Him to come as a human being?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, there cannot be no difficulty. That is reasonable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if we take Him... Just like here there are so many gentlemen, now here is a lawyer or here is a high-court judge, and if I take him, that he's also an ordinary man, that is my mistake. Even if he comes as ordinary visitor, still he's high-court judge. His position is not declined.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That, sir, we will have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore Kṛṣṇa, even you take that He has come as human being, still He is Kṛṣṇa, He is God. That is explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">avajānanti māṁ mūḍhā<br class="calibre2"/>mānuṣīṁ tanum āśritam<br class="calibre2"/>paraṁ bhāvam ajānanto<br class="calibre2"/>mama bhūta-maheśvaram<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.11]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Translation: "Fools deride Me when I descend in the human form. They do not know My transcendental nature and My supreme dominion over all that be."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, but these type of statements have been made in all the other religions also. The prophet always speaks like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, the prophet can speak. Prophet is representative of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, it is just like that, sir, just you said it is like a small pond and big pond. No doubt, He is a big light. You cannot that thing. But what my confusion is, is this thing, that we have to, and a <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> will also, with a limited sense, will never be able to go to that extent unless he has to surrender to some bigger power than him. And what I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we, we take Kṛṣṇa as the bigger power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Sure, we have to take. This is my... We have to take a bigger power. Otherwise...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if we take Kṛṣṇa as bigger power, there is no controversy. Whatever He says you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, we have to take like this. Just like we have to take even some of this, any statement you make, we are going to take it because we think people of your status, who have experienced the life, which I didn't do, they are the authority on that thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if you accept Kṛṣṇa authority, then at least He is bigger than you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Yes, sure. Not only authority on this thing. Because they have experienced, they have gone through that stage. And definitely we have to, because the..., just like from a teacher a boy learns, and it is that method. You have to learn from a higher person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you do accept Kṛṣṇa as the highest authority, and not only you accept, but all other authorities, they accept. Find out this verse. <span class="Italic">Paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">arjuna uvāca<br class="calibre2"/>paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma<br class="calibre2"/>pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam<br class="calibre2"/>ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 10.12]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Puruṣaṁ śāśvataṁ divyam ādi-devam ajaṁ vibhum.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">āhus tvaṁ ṛṣayaḥ sarve<br class="calibre2"/>devarṣir nāradas tathā<br class="calibre2"/>asito devalo vyāsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>svayaṁ caiva bravīṣi me</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is confirmation that He is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So if we accept Him as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, then you have to accept Him as He says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> As a great power, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not great power, but greatest power. Nobody is greater than Him. That is accepted by the direct listener of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Arjuna. And he is giving evidences of Vyāsadeva, Asita, Devala, Nārada, they are authorities. And in the recent years, the <span class="Italic">ācāryas</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Nimbārka and Caitanya Mahāprabhu, they have all accepted. And He speaks also. Then where is doubt? Where is doubt?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> No, I just want to clear this thing, that thing I accept, sir, this thing that it is a great power, the supreme power.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not a great, <span class="Italic">the</span> great power. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is no more greater power than Him. That is His position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> My point is, sometimes this, a difference comes in this thing. Suppose a man of other religion says, okay...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, it is not question of religion. It is a question of God. God is great. That is accepted by all religions. So if Kṛṣṇa is great, then He is God. Where is the argument?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Then they didn't come, just like you stated, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have to study Kṛṣṇa, that where is the great, the only great. Then you'll understand. God is great, there is... No religion will differ in this connection. But if find that "Yes, Kṛṣṇa is the greatest," then you have to accept. There is no other argument. So I'll take a little time go to shower. Hare Kṛṣṇa.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is coming back in about five minutes, he's just going to the bathroom. [break] (Prabhupāda returns) ...original <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> We got it from the Library of Congress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So God is great. Now we have to analyze what is the greatness. A man is supposed to be great when he is very rich. A man is supposed to be great when he is very wise, man of knowledge, strength, reputation. So item by item, you analyze and see, you'll see Kṛṣṇa is the greatest. By reasoning. Therefore He is God. They have been analyzed. You'll find in <span class="Italic">The Nectar of Devotion,</span> the Gosvāmīs have analyzed the characteristics of Kṛṣṇa, and they found Him the greatest. So if God is great, and He is the greatest, then He is God. How can you deny it? At least, we can see in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the little knowledge given by Kṛṣṇa, it is still standing as the greatest. Five thousand years past, nobody could give such a book of knowledge throughout the whole world. The <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is studied not only by the Indians and Hindus but by all scholars of the world. Even such persons who think that there is somebody greater than Kṛṣṇa, they also read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and they recite from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Even Śaṅkarācārya, the leader of the Māyāvādīs, he says <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā kiñcid adhītā.</span> Is it not? Does he not say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> Was it not true also Śaṅkarācārya Swamiji who said <span class="Italic">vande kṛṣṇa jagat-guru</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Vande Kṛṣṇa jagat-guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he's the leader of the impersonalists, he accepts <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇas tu bhagavān svayam [SB </span>1.3.28]<span class="Italic">. Sa bhagavān svayam kṛṣṇa.</span> Then what to speak of the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya. Rāmānujācārya has given <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> comments, every line Vedic evidence. You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> commented by Rāmānujācārya, you'll find every line he has quoted from <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> So there is no doubt about it. Simply one has to study very intelligently about Kṛṣṇa, then he will come to the conclusion that He is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> I'd like to ask a question, but I'm a little bit timid about doing so, but I will ask it. Would it be possible to think of.... Well, first I have to say that I tend to think of religions as personalities. Would it be possible...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (3):</span> All the religions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why you think like that? You are not authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I merely say that I do. I don't say that I'm right to do so. I don't say why, I simply do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is due to our limited knowledge. Because I am a person, I have got my limited knowledge. I am thinking of God, "If God is a person, then He has limited knowledge." That means I am bringing God to my level. That is my defect. We say God is all-powerful, almighty, still He cannot become a person. Why do you think that? If He is almighty, He can become person. Then why do you deny it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I don't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then there is no question, you see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But I still want to ask a question, not that it's a right question, but I do want to ask it. I'm not sure that I can formulate it, but it would be a little like this, maybe. Uh, uh, well, maybe I don't have to ask it. I'll skip it. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you are Christian?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> No. I am...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are not Christian? Whatever you may be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Would it be possible to say-this is my question-would it be possible to say that all the religions are, as it were, aspects of the personality of Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, our definition of religion is that religion is the word or the law given by God. That is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, but then there are these religions. There's more than one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, we have to agree on the principle. Religion means the word of God or the law given by God. That is religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> But I go into a Catholic Church and I feel a different environmental personality from the environmental personality I feel when I come here. Or, and, if I'm looking for God, which I think is here, I feel God, certainly I feel it very strongly, in your person-well, that's a brutal thing to say, but I do-and that is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we have already explained. Because every living entity is part and parcel of God, so just like the particle of gold, the gold is there. There is no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Yes, but sometimes you feel it more than at other times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be big particle or small particle. But particle there may be different sizes, that is another thing, but as soon as you get a particle, the gold is already there. Similarly, whenever you find any living entity, God is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> That certainly answers my question then. It really does. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And actually God is there with the living entity, <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe 'rjuna tiṣṭhati [Bg. 18.61].</span> He particularly pointed out, "Here is God within their core of the heart." Now the yogis, they try to find out God in his body, that is called meditation. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ [SB </span>12.13.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is process of the <span class="Italic">yogis,</span> to find out God within himself. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is also stated <span class="Italic">jagatvena, tat tvena</span> (?) Find out. So God is everywhere, there is no doubt about it. Within you, within me, within the atom, everywhere. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is explained in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also, <span class="Italic">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvam,</span> "I am everywhere." So God is everywhere, that is God's omnipresence, omnipotency. But still God has His actual position. <span class="Italic">Na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ. </span></div>
<div class="Verse">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br class="calibre2"/>mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni<br class="calibre2"/>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>9.4]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">So this is a great science. If we understand, then we can understand what is God, what is His position, how He is great, everything. That is His greatness. Although He is in His own abode, still, He is everywhere. That is His greatness. I am here, I am not in my bedroom, but about God it is said, <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty akhilātmā-bhuto [Bs. </span>5.37]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is God. He is far, far away from our, this planet. There is a planet, <span class="Italic">goloka eva nivasaty.</span> He's there, but still He is everywhere. That is His greatness. That is the distinction between Him and us. We are in one place, but we are not all-pervading. In another verse it is explained, <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata kṣetra-kṣetrajñayor</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 13.3]<span class="Italic">. Kṣetra kṣetrajñaḥ.</span> The living entity is <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñāḥ,</span> one who knows about his body. The body is called <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> field, field of activities. I am working with this body. The cat is working with his body, dog is working with his body, mosquito is working with his body. The body is the field of activity, and the soul within the body is the owner of the body, or occupier of the body, not owner. So God is also with him. Therefore He says <span class="Italic">kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> God is present along with the living entity, I or you, in everything. I know the pains and pleasure of my body, you know the pains and pleasure of your body, but God knows the pains and pleasure of your body, my body, his body, this body, that body. That is the difference between God and you. These things are explained. Go on, read it.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> Thanks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the purport?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "While discussing the subject of this body and the owner of the body, the soul and the Supersoul, we shall find three different topics of study: the Lord, the living entity, and matter. In every field of activities, in every body, there are two souls: the individual soul and the Supersoul. Because the Supersoul is the plenary expansion of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa says, 'I am also the knower, but I am not the individual owner of the body. I am the superknower. I am present in every body as the Paramātmā, or Supersoul.' One who studies the subject matter of the field of activity and the knower of the field very minutely, in terms of this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> can attain to knowledge. The Lord says: 'I am the knower of the field of activities in every individual body.' The individual may be the knower of his own body, but he is not in knowledge of other bodies. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is present as the Supersoul in all bodies, knows everything about all bodies. He knows all the different bodies of all the various species of life. A citizen may know everything about his patch of land, but the king knows not only his palace but all the properties possessed by the individual citizens. Similarly, one may be the proprietor of the body individually, but the Supreme Lord is the proprietor of all bodies. The king is the original proprietor of the kingdom, and the citizen is the secondary proprietor. Similarly, the Supreme Lord is the supreme proprietor of all bodies. The body consists of the senses. The Supreme Lord is Hṛṣīkeśa, which means controller of the senses. He is the original controller of the senses just as the king is the original controller of all the activities of the state, and the citizens are secondary controllers. The Lord also says: 'I am also the knower.' This means that He is the superknower; the individual soul knows only his particular body. In the Vedic literature, it is stated as follows:</div>
<div class="Verse">kṣetrāṇi hi sarīrāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>bījaṁ cāpi śubhāśubhe<br class="calibre2"/>tāni vetti sa yogātmā<br class="calibre2"/>tataḥ kṣetrajña ucyate</div>
<div class="Purp-para">[break] This body is called the <span class="Italic">kṣetra,</span> and within it dwells the owner of the body and the Supreme Lord, who knows both the body and the owner of the body. Therefore He is called the knower of all fields. The distinction between the field of activities, the owner of activities, and the supreme owner of activities is described as follows. Perfect knowledge of the constitution of the body, the constitution of the individual soul, and the constitution of the Supersoul is known in terms of Vedic literature as <span class="Italic">jñānam.</span> That is the opinion of Kṛṣṇa. To understand both the soul and the Supersoul as one yet distinct is knowledge. One who does not understand the field of activity activity and the knower of activity is not in perfect knowledge. One has to understand the position of <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> (nature), and <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> (the enjoyer of the nature), and <span class="Italic">īśvara</span> (the knower who dominates or controls nature and the individual soul). One should not confuse the three in their different capacities. One should not confuse the painter, the painting and the easel. This material world, which is the field of activities, is nature, and the enjoyer of nature is the living entity, and above them both is the supreme controller, the Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the Vedic language: <span class="Italic">bhoktā bhogyaṁ preritaraṁ ca matvā sarvaṁ proktaṁ tri-vidhaṁ brahmam etat.</span> There are three Brahman conceptions: <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> is Brahman as the field of activities, and the <span class="Italic">jīva</span> (individual soul) is also Brahman and is trying to control material nature, and the controller of both of them is also Brahman, but He is the factual controller."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore, He is called Param Brahman. <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> Everything is Brahman, but He is Param Brahman. That is accepted by Arjuna, <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ brahma pavitram.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "In this chapter it will also be explained that out of the two knowers, one is fallible and the other is infallible; one is superior and the other subordinate. One who understands the two knowers of the field to be one and the same contradicts the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who states here very clearly that 'I am also the knower of the field of activity.' One who misunderstands a rope to be a serpent is not in knowledge."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He says "I am also." <span class="Italic">Ksetrajñaṁ ca. Ca</span> means "also." They are two. Individual, <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñaḥ,</span> and the collective, <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñaṁ ca.</span> There is <span class="Italic">kṣetrajñam,</span> I am also there. They are two, not one. <span class="Italic">Ksetrajñaṁ cāpi ca api, kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi.</span> As soon as there is <span class="Italic">ca,</span> "and," then there are two. Not one.

<div class="Purp-para"> He is Param Brahma, He is the supreme great. You study and then you will understand.

And that is possible only through <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Kṛṣṇa specifically mentions, <span class="Italic">bhaktyā mām abhijānāti [Bg. </span>18.55]<span class="Italic">.</span> He never says, "By <span class="Italic">jñāna,</span> yoga, <span class="Italic">karma,</span> one can understand Me." No. <span class="Italic">Bhakti. Bhakto si,</span> "You will understand, Arjuna, because you are My <span class="Italic">bhakta</span>."

And nondevotees, they are not submissive. They are so proud that they say "I am Bhagavān, I am God." So that attitude will not help to understand. (Prabhupāda converses in Hindi with an Indian lady about how one does not have to renounce family life to understand Kṛṣṇa.) He says <span class="Italic">paraṁ brahma paraṁ dhāma pavitraṁ paramaṁ bhavān</span> [Bg. 10.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> He understands perfectly. There is no question of <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> It is a question of understanding.

And guru also will see, "He's appealing to me, he is going to accept my discipleship, let me see whether he is qualified." Then there should be guru and <span class="Italic">śiṣya,</span> not that as a fashion. Like Arjuna, Arjuna accepted Kṛṣṇa as guru after talking with Him.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> What about the other atoms within me or the dog? Do you understand what I'm getting at? There are millions of atoms.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's saying this body is comprised of atoms, so the Paramātmā is present within this body alongside the individual soul that's operating this body. But there's also millions of other atoms, and Kṛṣṇa is also within the atoms as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4):</span> I thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> Mr. Deyani brought a person that he studies under one time to meet me at the temple, and he took a very remote verse out of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> about sacrifice, and his idea is that to perform <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is the way to purify the universe in this age of Kali-yuga, and Deyani was very supportive of him. So I was wondering maybe you could explain a little.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now <span class="Italic">yajña</span> means, what does it mean, "by <span class="Italic">yajña</span>"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> Swamiji, he says that whole Vedic religion is in five, <span class="Italic">yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma-śraddhāya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, yajña-dāna-tapaḥ-karma na tyājyaṁ kāryam eva tat.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> Yes, he said that. Now he brought one more point, he says all the world over people have forgotten. Every morning we do..., he says <span class="Italic">yajña</span> has many meanings, but he says <span class="Italic">yajña</span> means to burn the cow ghee in the fire, and this fumigation, he gives here certain purifies the atmosphere and thus, if you do it at the right time in the morning, when the sun-there is some time which he gives-and in the evening, he says you will yourself see that your mind changes, your <span class="Italic">praṇa,</span> it affect your <span class="Italic">praṇa,</span> and then it affects your mind, and if you are-anyway, you will try to understand yourself by yourself. Once you do, he says it's just a physical aid, it is not any spiritual thing, but this is a physical aid. And that is what our, there are, many Americans are doing there this program. And he gives a very nice scientific background of that thing, which convinces me that what we Hindus, what our Vedic literature, what they have said, it has some scientific meaning behind it, why we did it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But thing is, accepting his statement, first of all, where is <span class="Italic">ghee</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> Well, in this country you can get.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In this country, but there are places there is no <span class="Italic">ghee.</span> Then how you will perform? Your first proposition is <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> but where is <span class="Italic">ghee</span>? It is all <span class="Italic">dalda.</span> Now how you can perform <span class="Italic">yajña</span>? I am talking as a matter of argument. If <span class="Italic">ghee</span> is not available, then how <span class="Italic">yajña</span> will be performed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> That is actually the question when I first met him. (laughter) I asked him, really, I told him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then his proposal is failure. Now you have to take the instruction in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> that</div>
<div class="Verse">kṛte yad dhyāyato viṣṇuṁ<br class="calibre2"/>tretāyāṁ yajato makhaiḥ<br class="calibre2"/>dvāpare paricaryāyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kalau tad dhari-kīrtanāt<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">SB</i> 12.3.52]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"> In the Kali-yuga, the real <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana. Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ. Sumedhasaḥ,</span> those who have got good brain, they perform this <span class="Italic">yajña, hari-kīrtana.</span> So there is no condition. God has give you the tongue. Either you are here or there, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prayair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady:</span> Is number important in chanting? It has to be certain number, or you can just chant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Number? Yes, of course, no. Actually, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> Always to be chanted. But because you cannot do that, therefore you must fix up a number. <span class="Italic">Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ. Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka,</span> that "I must chant so many times." That is determination. I have prescribed to my disciples that "You must chant at least sixteen rounds." That is very easy. But there is <span class="Italic">saṅkhyā. Saṅkhyā-pūrvaka-nāma-gāna-natibhiḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">Gosvāmīs,</span> they used to do that. So it is; otherwise, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ.</span> The chanting should go on twenty-four hours. Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura used to do. He was simply chanting. But that is not possible for ordinary man. Therefore they should have a fixed up, that "I must chant so many times." That will fix up the determination. <span class="Italic">Bhajante māṁ dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> There must be some <span class="Italic">dṛḍha-vratāḥ,</span> that "I must do it." Then the devotion grows very firm. If we become lenient, "All right, I shall do later on..." No, must be done. <span class="Italic">Dṛḍha-vratāḥ. Mahātmānas tu māṁ pārtha daivīṁ prakṛtim āśritāḥ [Bg. </span>9.13]<span class="Italic">. Dṛḍha-vratāḥ.</span> Everything should be determined. Then spiritual progress will be rapid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> So many, when we go to our offices, since we come from India, naturally the very intelligent young boys and girls, they ask various questions to us. And just for the sake of their curiosity, naturally they ask the question about the Kṛṣṇa consciousness, we try to explain our ways, whatever we know. What explanation we have got when they put the example of, you know, that sixteen-year-old guru and something like that kind of things? What explanation we have got in that circumstance. In that circumstance, what explanation we have got as an individual for the Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This young boy guru, when they bring up this subject matter to the Indians who have come from India who are working here in America, they feel a little embarrassed, loss for words or explanation what to say, that this is their Indian culture, they feel they don't know how to represent themselves.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> How to represent the Kṛṣṇa consciousness? This is my question. How to represent it? What to say to them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your question? That means you do not know about him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> We don't know about those gurus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say "I do not know about him," that's all. The simple truth that "I do not know about it." Why you are very serious about him? It is not very important matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mr. Deyani:</span> I even don't know who is he. (laughter) To tell you the truth, I even don't know. (laughter) My wife, she sometimes, why she watch him on the television. There was a program or something like that, that now we, I don't watch that anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not important.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> Swamiji, you just said about the guru, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> again after He is explaining to Arjuna all what He said, then ultimately he comes and he says-which the problem in our practical life comes which I see, I see it with me-he spoke very frankly, <span class="Italic">cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham [Bg. </span>6.34]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> After, you know, the Kṛṣṇa, He has explained to Arjuna all the religion and spirituality, and still a man of the caliber of Arjuna speaks, then he said, <span class="Italic">cañcalaṁ hi manaḥ kṛṣṇa pramāthi balavad dṛḍham,</span> that verse.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is said in the Sixth Chapter<span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>6.34].</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> That comes in practical life. One might even say that you try to go to a spiritual area, then all these things do come in everybody's life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that was spoken in connection with practicing yoga.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> But Arjuna got it due to guru, like Kṛṣṇa means is it possible in this age if one has the right guru, a man, he can elevate himself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take Arjuna as guru. Kṛṣṇa spoke to Arjuna, <span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> He directly listened to Him. And he's guru therefore, because the guru is by the <span class="Italic">paramparā.</span> So he understood Kṛṣṇa. So you take Arjuna's instruction. Make Arjuna your guru. What does he say? He accepts Kṛṣṇa, Param Brahman. So we accept Kṛṣṇa as Param Brahma. Where is the difficulty? Arjuna, by his direct experience talking with Kṛṣṇa, he understood Him that "Kṛṣṇa, you are Param Brahman." So you take the words of Arjuna and accept Him as Param Brahman. Where is the difficulty? Just like the same example, one lawyer giving example, the judgment of other court. That is accepted. So Arjuna is accepting Kṛṣṇa as Param Brahman. So why don't you accept? Where is the difficulty? You accept Arjuna as your guru, and whatever he says, you accept it. The difficulty is that we do not accept guru. That is the difficulty. Otherwise where is difficulty? Five thousand years, Kṛṣṇa spoke to Arjuna, but what Arjuna understood, that is there. So you accept it. What we are doing? We are accepting. That's all. Kṛṣṇa said <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> "There is no more superior truth beyond Me." We are accepting, that's all. Where is the difficulty? But if you do not accept, who can make you to accept? It is not possible. Kṛṣṇa therefore said <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> "You do it." He never forces him. He's God, He can force, "You must do it." No, he doesn't say "You do it." Not only that, He says <span class="Italic">yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Whatever you like, you do." What is that verse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Iti te jñānam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Iti te jñānam,</span> huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ākhyātam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ākhyātam,</span> "I have spoken to you everything about knowledge." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Guhyād guhyataraṁ mayā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Guhyād guhyataram.</span> "<span class="Italic">Jñānam</span> confidential, more confidential, I have spoken to you, one after another." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Vimṛśyaitad aśeṣeṇa,</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Now you consider, <span class="Italic">vimṛśya. Aśeṣeṇa,</span> without any doubt, fully consider." Then?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru,</span> full liberty. He never says that "You must do it." No, He never forces. "I have spoken to you everything of all knowledge. Now you consider it, deliberate deliberately. Then you decide yourself what to do." The liberty is given. "But My opinion is <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is My opinion. You do it. Otherwise, you do whatever you like." This liberty is there. "But if you, as you are My friend, then I give you the most confidential knowledge." <span class="Italic">Sarva-guhyatamam, sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> So it is open to everyone to accept or not to accept. But if you want Kṛṣṇa's opinion, then there is opinion, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> Now it is up to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5) (Indian man):</span> Swamiji, perhaps you can..., when people ask about this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is only limited to a few full-time devotees, I had expressed, now in <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> it is expressed, now read the words according to basic extents to people who follow and accept Kṛṣṇa to practically everyone, to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who? Everyone? Everyone is Kṛṣṇa? No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> To all the people who want to accept movement.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> He can be a part of the Kṛṣṇa movement, with whatever, <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you read next.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-karmaṇā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Sva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vaca?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhyarcya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhyarcya,</span> that is the important word. <span class="Italic">Sarva-karmaṇā tam abhyarcya.</span> Whatever engagement you may have, with that engagement you <span class="Italic">abhyarcya,</span> just worship Him. <span class="Italic">Abhyarcya</span> means worshiping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya,</span> yes. So <span class="Italic">tam,</span> the supreme, He who worshiped. And He is the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So in any position, if you worship Kṛṣṇa, then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> But is that correct?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the correct, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> So after giving all this in the chapter eighteen, then He points out that despite all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the thing is, best thing is <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> <span class="Italic">Mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you cannot do that, then in your position you can also <span class="Italic">abhyarcya,</span> you can worship Him. And especially in this age, whatever position you are, you can chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">abhyarcya. He Kṛṣṇa, he hari.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> Worship Him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, this is worship. This is worshiping. "Engage me in Your service." Just like Haridāsa Ṭhākura. He was simply chanting. He was doing nothing. So simply... You are engaged as professor. You go on with your professorship, but chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Where is the loss? Rather, your students will learn "Oh, he is such a big professor, he is chanting. Let me chant." You'll be preaching at the same time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> I'm a bureaucrat, no longer a professor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be... Because <span class="Italic">yad yad ācarati śreṣṭhas tad tad evetaro janaḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> If a chief man practices something, the followers also practice. So a businessman, professor, scientist, philosopher, they chant the holy name of God, there is no taxation, no income tax, but the income is very good. (laughter) So why people do not do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (5):</span> (Sanskrit)....</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is explained by Caitanya,</div>
<div class="Verse">nāmnām akāri bahudhā nija-sarva-śaktis<br class="calibre2"/>tatrārpitā niyamitaḥ smaraṇe na kālaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>etādṛśī tava kṛpā bhagavān mamāpi<br class="calibre2"/>durdaivam īdṛśam ihājani nānurāgaḥ</div>
<div class="Purp-para">The holy name of God is so powerful, as good as God. <span class="Italic">Nāmnām akāri bahudhā,</span> He has got thousands of names, hundreds of names, and each name is invested with the power of God Himself. So in this age this chanting of holy name of God is recommended, I can take advantage of it, but I am so unfortunate I have no inclination. So easy thing, but still I am so unfortunate I do not wish to take the name of God. This is stated by Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">etadṛśi tava kṛpā bhagavān mamāpi.</span> "Bhagavān, my Lord, You are so merciful, I can be direct connection with You simply by chanting Your holy name. You have given this facility in this age, and still I am so unfortunate I am not inclined." <span class="Italic">Tam abhyarcya.</span> We are not inclined to worship. That is the defect. When there is question of worshiping Him, so many things we bring in, not to worship Him, just to counteract the proposal. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhaktaḥ.</span> So we bring all kinds of argument how to not to become a <span class="Italic">bhakta.</span> That is our misfortune. He says "You become My devotee." We are putting arguments, how not to become His devotee. That is our misfortune. We bring all arguments. This is misfortune.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it's 8:30. Want to finish up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vipina:</span> I was talking to Dr. Diksha and I was explaining to him that if he was unable to chant or to become a full-time devotee, that your program for a person in that condition of life, was something like Life Membership Program, whereby he could become a member of the Society, maintain his occupational duty, but become a member and take books and read and try to understand gradually that way. Is that satisfactory, if they can do that much, that would be, some way they would be serving Kṛṣṇa to your satisfaction? (Prabhupāda laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, we are taking so much labor in writing books. If somebody reads, certainly that is satisfaction. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> It is to their benefit, Śrīla Prabhupāda, if they read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I am writing for reading by others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rūpānuga:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda. What time is the initiation? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...our temple early in the morning at about seven o'clock Śrīla Prabhupāda will deliver a lecture and also there will be a sacrifice, very ancient sacrifice performed, which is formal initiation, of becoming a disciple of a spiritual master, and you are welcome to come by. It is a very colorful and beautiful ceremony. This will take place tomorrow morning at 7 a.m. here in the temple. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
