<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mind's business is restlessness. Where is surprising? Therefore we have to fix up our mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa. Otherwise there is no way. It is very restless. That is the nature. The yogis, they try to control the mind by mechanical process-<span class="Italic">dhyāna, dhāraṇā, āsana, prāṇāyāma.</span> [break] Cigarette is, I think, advertised, "Nobody is lower than me." That means no other cigarette is lower in poisonous effect. In a different way it is advertised. "Nobody is lower than me." Humble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Who is that, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cigarette is full of poison. It is being advertised, "Nobody is lower than me."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> Oh, yes, the tar content.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means "I am first, I am first class." Less poison. "Nobody contains lower poison than me." [break] ...city, when it was constructed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A lot of the buildings are from the early 1800s, 1850. Like the Museum of Natural History that we visited, that was 1869. It was settled even earlier than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> It was always a very important city. For almost two or three hundred years it's been a very important city for trade, business, commerce.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you first settled?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the 1600s.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Toṣaṇa Kṛṣṇa, he was doing that for about three weeks in a row.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ādi-keśava:</span> All night long.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He would go out all night long for about three weeks, putting those posters up everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> This is tall. Tamāla, this is an older section?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, not that old. These buildings were built in the '30s, '40s.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are going to the Riverside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Riverside Park. Would have been faster, wouldn't it, to go down on Westside Drive? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was coming here daily for cooking my food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Purchasing food?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the park, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> At one Dr. Mishra's house. In my apartment there was no kitchen. [break] There was some news. Their machine has gone to Mars planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Machine is?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They sent some machine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To Mars?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> To picture, to take pictures around the Mars, to take pictures, and they have found on Mars signs of life and water. They have taken many close pictures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Of Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they know that this time if they say there is no life, then there is no interest. This time another falsehood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Maybe some life this time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some new falsehood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> All the things that they have found has put doubt of their previous discoveries. They have put... They say this themselves, that it has revolutionized all their knowledge by some pictures they have now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...the solid stone, and still, life is coming, and they say there is no life. [break] In the moon planet there is sand, but wherefrom the sand came? Without water, where is the experience of sand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Sand, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sand. We get sand from the water. So unless there was water, how there is sand? Who will answer this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Desert, like the desert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there was water. There was water. You cannot say that sand has come automatically. It comes from... What is that sand? It's soda-silicate. The water is soda, full of soda, and from that, sand comes. You are chemist. You know soda silicate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Brahma-tīrtha prabhu, Bob Cohen, is a geologist. He just got initiated yesterday.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He's the Peace Corps devotee from India? He is a scientist in the field of geology, studies the earth and how these formations come, and he's working with the scientists to prove their misunderstandings, their false claims.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, without water there cannot be sand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span>. So early in the moon's history, when it was first formed, when there was gaseous clouds, then there was the water in the atmosphere...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There was water?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But then, due to the atmosphere being dry, not being any atmosphere, now it's just rocks and dust.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why the atmosphere changed? There was water? Why the atmosphere changed? [break] ...is water, there must be vegetation. So where those vegetation gone? All false propaganda. Even in the sea you'll find seaweed. Is it not? So as soon as there is water, there must be vegetation. And without water, sand does not come. If there is sand, there is water, there is vegetation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So if there was originally an atmosphere, why is it not there now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all rascal, "atmosphere." What atmosphere? Whole world is made of these material elements. Why the atmosphere should be different? Maybe more or less; that is another thing. Just like in the Western country it is very cool and the Eastern it is country hot. But that does not mean everything is changed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> On this planet we have certain elements, like iron, water, or sand. Could there be other elements on other planets, new elements?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Same elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More or less. Just like in the heavenly planets it is said that the roads are built with pearls. So there is more pearl. Here is also. The pearl quantity is there. Therefore they pave on the road.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You told us, in Hawaii, they had emeralds as big as huge boulders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, big rocks, like this, when we were walking in Hawaii.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> And the beaches are made of gems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, so what is the difficulty? This is also stone; that is also stone. That is valuable stone, that's all-valuable in your eye.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So <span class="Italic">kalpa-vṛkṣa</span> is the topmost, and this is perverted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So the moon planet is said to be high planet, but sand is not as nice as vegetation. How is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> The moon planet is said to be higher planet, but sand is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they say that moon planet, there is sand. They have brought sand. I say, "Wherefrom the sand came unless there is water?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Came from Arizona. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually when they brought that dust, they said they brought that dust back, they made the point that it's just like the dust here. That's the same things again. You pointed out, "Why they are mentioning Arizona when they're talking about Mars?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That means they've never been past Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All business is going on in Arizona.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> You once said there is a gross and subtle part of the moon planet. Is that so? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> You said one who had qualification could get to the actual moon planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Moon is one. There are not so many moons. Moon is one. You can go to the moon. By ritualistic ceremony you can get there ten thousands of years life and enjoy. That is the heavenly planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> So they have not at all gone there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All false propaganda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> I think we should go back now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Planet is full of life. <span class="Italic">Jana-(indistinct).</span> All kinds of animals are there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> Even in the Arizona desert there are different kinds of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There must be. [break] ...use of going to the Mars planet. What is their idea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> They constantly want to discover more and more so that they can claim that they are lords.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But what is that discovery?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Scientific knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You simply go and see? That's all?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> There is no really purpose, Śrīla Prabhupāda, no valid purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They consider it advancement of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not advancement of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They want to colonize because there is overpopulation on this planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Another rascal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> They want to put the American flag on the moon and say, "It is ours."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then lick up. "Here is American flag." (laughter) And then doglike urine(?) (within?) (laughter) So lick up, then doglike urine(?) (women?). It is useless. (laughter) Dog's business. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, they feel they should explore the unknown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That will remain everlastingly unknown. They'll never be able to push. <span class="Italic">Panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-saṁpragamyaḥ.</span> What is this speed? Even with the speed of mind and air they go many, many millions of years, it will still be... This verse of <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, panthās tu koṭi-śata-vatsara-saṁpragamyo vāyor athāpi manaso muni-puṅgavānām, so 'py asti avicintya-tattve</span> [Bs. 5.34]<span class="Italic">. </span> It is inconceivable. It will never be done. They have some vague idea, "There is no life. There is this. There is that." That's... Real knowledge they'll never get. Real knowledge you'll get from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They don't even know what is inside the ocean, what to speak of other planets.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And if they take photograph of the ocean, what they will understand what is within the ocean? Suppose they have taken photograph of the ocean. Does it mean the full knowledge of ocean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Only speculation, only speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply speculation. They are bluffing, "We have taken photograph." Suppose you have taken photograph. Does it mean that you have known everything? Nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They don't even know all the species of life here, so how will they know which one's there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Just like when a photograph of a person is there, it doesn't mean they know what is inside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they bluff, "We have taken photograph." And what you have known about it? Simply bluff.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The whole thing is so childish, it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They tried to find the bottom of the deepest part of the ocean, and their submarine snapped in half and they all died. There's too much pressure. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How life is coming by force? And they say there is no soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You made the point the other day during massage that even though our building is twelve stories high and it's made of steel and concrete, still, there's small plants growing straight out of the cement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. [break] They do not go to the sun planet. What is the reason?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> They say that no life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again life, no life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tripurāri:</span> They think it's too hot for life to exist there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how Kṛṣṇa was there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They don't believe that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how can I believe you? If you don't believe Kṛṣṇa, shall I have to believe you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> They have calculated that as soon as you come within a certain amount, a billion miles of the sun...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is you. That is you, not Kṛṣṇa. That is the difference between you and Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> [break] Across the river, there was reports from many people that one ship landed from another planet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> Across the river there were reports from many people that a ship from another planet landed and took soil samples and then left. And everyone reported that saw, they were very much afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> A thief suspects everyone as being a thief. So everybody's afraid because they know that they would attack everybody else. Therefore they think everyone else is in the same mood. They never think of people from other planets as being friendly. They always consider that they will immediately try to kill everyone and conquer, because that's what they would do. That's their business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rādhāvallabha:</span> About thirty or forty years ago a man named Orson Welles did a..., he had a radio show, and just as a joke he started giving a news report that the Martians had landed, and people were panicking. They were trying to leave the city in cars in huge numbers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> Thousands of people started to leave the city in fear. I think it was on April Fools? It was just a joke.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We can go down to the right, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...difference between a <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> and <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> A <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> can be misled at any moment. That is stated in... <span class="Italic">Strī śūdra.</span> Woman and <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> on the same class. You can mislead them by high talkings: "Oh, I am coming from Indian prince." They come here, marry some European, and go to India and then engage him (her) for collecting water in bucket. One Muhammadan crewman, a vagabond, he bluffed one girl that "I am coming from Muhammadan prince family." Then she married, and she went to Allahabad, and she was given <span class="Italic">borakhā</span> and she was living in a hut, and then she was bringing water from the street. She wrote a letter to the Viceroy that "This is my position." Then police came and rescued her and sent her. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> ...<span class="Italic">Pañca-tantra</span> about a jackal who poses as a king. He has blue dye on, so they think he's special, but when he heard other jackals, all he could do was howl, and he was exposed. [break]</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bali-mardana:</span> He's here, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now there should be one rule that unless they are husband-wife, man and woman should not worship together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Strictly prohibited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the same altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Different altars is all right, but not the same altar.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, different quarters... They should not go to the...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Man and woman together should not worship unless they are husband and wife.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Never be alone. So just because they are married to someone else, that is not... They must be married to each other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, they must be together, the man and the woman. The husband-wife can go, not others.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In most temples that is not the system right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that system should be introduced. The husband-wife together can go to worship the Deity. If they are not related as husband, they should not go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about a situation like this, where the husband and wife are worshiping but also some other <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> are also worshiping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Still, that is some protection. The husband is there. The woman means her husband must be there. Which one? Our car?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He's bringing it. He's bringing it up to this road here, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...dogs and cats.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no, cows are meant for eating, for food. It's all about dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So no woman who is married should work with the Deities unless her husband is right there? What if the husband is a book distributor? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That walking place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda will be leaving for the airport tonight.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> About six-fifteen at the latest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six, six-fifteen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, yes, six o'clock.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ādi-keśava, you have to make arrangements, garlands, flowers, devotees. [break] ...museum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which museum?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Museum of Natural History. Three hours we spent there, and we got a big headache.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Three hours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, we got a headache.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Seeing only dead bodies?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Dead bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Stuffed dead bodies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They have this one display trying to prove that..., the Darwin theory of evolution. They have these bones, and they say this proves how man was formerly like an ape or a monkey. Now he has become more civilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is Darwin's bones?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Then they have one display showing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Darwin got all this knowledge. His bones should be studied first, how he got so much knowledge. And from which monkey he came. By studying the bones, discover it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Complete concoction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask them to find out from which monkey the Darwin's bone has come. They may decide. Study the bones of Darwin. And spoiling public money in this way. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...each display they have some background artwork very expertly done. Say they have a display of a tiger. They have a painting of the forest in the background, and it's very well done. They spend a lot of money, with lighting systems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But none of the exhibits are moving. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...for one display of the different stages of the embryo growing. So to have this display they used actual dead aborted babies. They have them mounted in the display case, the dead babies that they have killed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Killed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Aborted babies. They have taken their tiny little bodies and put them in a display, so you can see the baby at two months, at four months, at six months, at eight months. Like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How it is growing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, the different...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, how it is growing? When it was put into the bottle, why it did not grow? It remained as it is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They say because they severed its connection with the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means the baby has grown from the mother. So mother is life. That is the proof. Otherwise how the baby has grown? You cannot say that life can be grown out of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Life from life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> As soon as they say that "It has grown from the mother," the mother is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Life from life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No one thinks like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are all rascals, therefore I say. They have no common sense, all rascals, dull. By eating meat they are... They may be like tigers or dogs, but they are not human beings. They may have strength of a tiger or barking capacity like a dog, but they are not human being. Useless. They cannot be used for anything human benefit, useless. We should take them like that, that "You may be a tiger, you may be a lion, you may be a dog, but you are not a human being. We do not accept you." A tiger is very powerful than ordinary human being, but that does not mean that a tiger is useful than the human being. That is not the way. [break] ...I ask, natural answer you gave, "Because it is disconnected with the mother." That is natural answer. Then how you can say the life has come from matter? Immediately you are captured. Can you say like that, that life has come without life? And they are making us believe like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The body is matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So at a certain stage life enters it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> At a certain stage...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> ...of development the life enters.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Therefore they say they can abort the baby. They say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That they do not know, when the soul enters. The soul enters in the first night when pregnancy begins. Otherwise how it will grow? Life begins from that point. It grows one day, two day, three day, five day, one month, three months, like that. But the growing, growth, begins from that very point. If the life has got shelter between the two secretions of father and mother, then it grows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> That is the only explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the only explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> They are very bewildered. They cannot imagine how a cell within the body is growing. They cannot imagine that there is a soul within it. Or a plant from a seed. They can never understand these things. Actually it's a fact. When we studied in biology before we became devotees, they never explained how the tree comes from the seed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The seed creates a favorable situation, and the life comes. On account of the life's presence, it grows, it develops. This is right explanation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sometimes we say, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that when the body is useless, then the soul leaves, just like giving up an old pair of clothes. But sometimes we see that someone in very good health, youthful, all of a sudden they give up their body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are very healthy. Is there any guarantee that you will not die?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, there's no guarantee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the life.(?) You may be very stout and strong. The death may take from so many causes. It does not depend on your healthy body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> When you say that we are kicked out, is it literally that we are kicked out of this body?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even if one is very attached.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (end)</div>
