<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśomatīnandana:</span> He will die by burning or something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> He was laughing when they were burning the steel rods. So Gāṇdīva's mother said, "In the same way you will also die by burning."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Gāṇdīva's mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No, but who said like that for that... Really he got that temple, no? This temple is his forefather's. And they were doing the ś<span class="Italic">raddhā pūjā</span> here. Then I knew that he died. He was a great, sort of a roguish man. His grandfather or somebody had some power to knows things here and there, and people used to come and worship him and give him some money. But this man started fanning him exactly like this, sort of a (Hindi). Parsis are coming very often. Parsis are very simple community.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara:</span> He has committed suicide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Yes, he has committed suicide, rightfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara:</span> He was drinking and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> What was he not doing? What was he not doing? He was in all this sort a big debauch, mentally, physically, all sensually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why he committed suicide?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He burned himself by pouring kerosene on his clothes. You Nara, you are here, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> All his sisters are not married excepting one. They are forty, forty-five years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara:</span> (unclear) either man or woman [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...worldwide known...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In the Christian religion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nara:</span> He was a loafer. He was not having two meals a day. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yaśomatīnandana has a book, and he would like to read a few sentences from that book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, we thought that we could play a game that Dr. Patel, he could identify who has written this book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Please don't allow him to read. (laughter) Let us talk about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> This is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You see, anything which is read out of context is no reading. You must read it reference to context. If you read some nonsense somebody must have spoken or written he's not all what he has written or spoken. So if Yaśomatīnandana reads that and Prabhupādajī talks something about the spirituality, no this moment... Because time is short and heart is long, and our heart is beating like muffled drums, so let us fulfill ourself before we die.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have got your injection. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is not for me. I give only... (laughs) His wife was brought yesterday to me, Yaśodānandana, and she told me that she was operated in the stomach for some growth. "What sort of growth was that? Was it malignant?" And she's suffering. Why don't you send her back or get the reports from the American hospital, what operation was performed on her, and we'll get out? Or she'll suffer all the time. That is the story of injection. Now let us talk. Until you realize God, then you are spirit. Up to then, you are always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "I am Indian." "I am American."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> More important: "I am a human being and others are lower animals." That is the greatest <span class="Italic">abhimana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Abhimana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also, what is called, false ego. Human being or animal, they are not different, because the body is made of the same ingredient. If you manufacture a dog like a dog, like a man, what is the difference? The ingredient is the same, earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Five <span class="Italic">bhūtas, pañca-bhūta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pañca-bhūta </span>So where is the difference? A man who knows, he will see so many dolls made of earth. He knows they are all earth. <span class="Italic">Ekatvam anupaśyataḥ [</span><span class="calibre3">Iso</span> 7]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">Some of it all, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all let me, let me understand. This bodily transformation does not make any difference. Either it is made like a dog or it is made like a man, it is made from the earth. So one who knows the ingredient, he does not make any difference. Because he knows the dog or the man made of the same ingredient. Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. </span>First of all the body. The bodily conscious even...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He has come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The bodily consciousness is also material. That is also one. And the soul consciousness, spiritual, that is also one. That is <span class="Italic">ekatvam.</span> So for a learned person there is no defect. <span class="Italic">Vidyā-vinaya-sampanne brāhmaṇe gavi hastini, paṇḍitaḥ samaḥ</span> [Bg. 5.18]<span class="Italic">. </span>This is the... So anyone who is under the bodily conception of life, either human beings or dogs, they are the same. But that <span class="Italic">upādhi</span> amongst human being is stronger than the cats and dogs. The human being, being advanced in consciousness, they are making this nationalism. But it is nothing but dogism. Is it not? That's all. The so-called national people are sacrificing so many lives, so many politicians, Napoleon and these big, big leaders. But what is their business? Business is that doggish mentality: "I am this body." So it is very difficult to give up this doggish mentality that "I am this body." Very, very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> False <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra.</span> Because he is not body, it is false <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra.</span> So <span class="Italic">śāstra </span>therefore says, <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti vihinasya jati japas tapaḥ kriya.</span> A person who has not developed Kṛṣṇa consciousness, for him this advancement of nationality, big work, industry, so on, so on, so on, <span class="Italic">jati japas tapaḥ kriya... Kriya,</span> these act...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>What are these? <span class="Italic">Apranasya hi dehasya mandanam loka-ranjanam.</span> It has no value. But people are enamored by these things, "I belong to great nation. I am American. We have got so many industries. We have got so many cars." Attachment. So it is very difficult.<span class="Italic"> Sarvo-padhi-vinirmuktam.</span> One, after becoming completely freed from all these false designations, to become a devotee is very, very difficult. There is no education.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Sarva-bhavena,</span> from all sides and from all degrees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is very difficult. So we are dealing with very, very difficult task. It is not very easy, the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement. Naturally we have got attraction for God. That is spiritual kingdom. Just like Vṛndāvana. Vṛndāvana means center is Kṛṣṇa. The elderly person like Nanda Mahārāja, Yaśoda, their friends, their..., they are also attracted to Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> are attracted to Kṛṣṇa, the cowherds boys, they are attracted to Kṛṣṇa. The cows, calves, animals and peacock-everyone is attracted to Kṛṣṇa. The water is attracted to Kṛṣṇa. That is Vṛndāvana. And here in the material world nobody is attracted by Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Who prevents them, sir? <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No. He wanted this; therefore <span class="Italic">māyā </span>is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>So that their position may go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Police is not first. First you become a thief; then police is there, not that police comes and arrest you unnecessary. No. As soon as you become criminal, then police comes and arrest you. māyā comes next. If you give up your natural attraction for Kṛṣṇa, if you are attracted by this material enjoyment, then māyā is there. Again if you try to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> But material, all material, is made up of māyā.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Nothing is made by <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> <span class="Italic">māyā </span>is made by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> And material is, nothing but the transformation of māyā, is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. No. <span class="Italic">māyā </span>means something false. Nobody makes anything. Everything is made by... <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa is the creator of everything. māyā is also created by Kṛṣṇa. So just like government creates police department. But police department is made for that person who violates the laws of God. The police department is creation of government. Similarly, <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> business is to capture, arrest the criminal who has gone against God, capture him. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha janmani janmani</span> [Bg. 16.20]<span class="Italic">. Mam aprapyaiva. </span>This is the arrangement. Nobody is independent. Everything. Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma. </span>So <span class="Italic">māyā </span>is also Brahman. <span class="Italic">māyā </span>is also Brahman. <span class="Italic">Sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma. </span>Why <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is different from God? It is creation of God. <span class="Italic">Mama māyā, </span>Kṛṣṇa says. <span class="Italic">Mama māyā.</span> So how māyā can be... The difference is police cannot arrest the president. Now it has been proved in the law. The president, the prime minister, they cannot be interfered by the police or law. That is good judgment. If the head of the estate is also interfered by police, that does not look well. So this judgment is very nice. Therefore in English constitution the first word is "The king can do no wrong." You cannot accuse king of doing wrong. Whatever he does, it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>That is when there was <span class="Italic">Rāma-rajya, </span>sir. These modern fellows will talk all these things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. No, no. <span class="Italic">Rāma-rajya</span> should be there as far as possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>They are roguish fellows. Just like Nixon. What did he do? Was it in the place of king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he... Nixon, Nixon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>Most powerful nation of the world having a leader of the type of Nixon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So that is... Of course, in American constitution the president is also impeached. Is it the law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> This is the first president who was impeached, during all the times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>But that is not very good law. That is not very good law. If the president also can be impeached, that is not very good law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Sir, if the government is made according to the rule and regulations established by our religions, then that president or the king is above law. Otherwise these fools must be within law. But the way they have been ruling the countries and ransacking the people's morals and material...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>No, no. Anyone, anyone who is within law, he cannot be president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>But these are within the law, president. These are the artificial constitutions made up, not the constitution as given by <span class="Italic">Vedas </span>and<span class="Italic"> Vedic</span> religions. Then king or president is above law-to my mind. I may be wrong. I am open to correction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore we want<span class="Italic"> rājarṣi.</span> We don't want ordinary king. <span class="Italic">Rājarṣi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Then it is all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel: :</span>Ah, those <span class="Italic">rājarṣis.</span> A king like Janaka.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone should be <span class="Italic">rājarṣi.</span> Otherwise he has no power to become king. He should be rejected. There are instances. Just like Vena Mahārāja. He was not <span class="Italic">rājarṣi, </span>so he was killed by the<span class="Italic"> brāhmaṇas:</span> "Get down." There are instances. Then Pṛthu Mahārāja became king.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Pṛthu was the incarnation of God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. So king is supposed to be representative of God if not incarnation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. Then he is above law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Because God is above law. But these people are representatives of the foolish, ignorant majority, and majority is made up of fools. Wise people are few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difficulty. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Fools' paradise. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That's right. We are living in fools' paradise. If the whole today universe was governed as it is ordained by Vedas and Vedic philosophy and laws, there would not have been any difficulty for us. But from time immemorial, even in the very place of the cradle of Vedic civilization, there were all these types of wars and (Hindi) and <span class="Italic">daityas</span> and <span class="Italic">devas</span> and all these things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: :</span>Yes. I have got some... [break] Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is the only remedy to make everyone the first-class human being. <span class="Italic">Yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcana sarvair guṇair tatra samasate suraḥ</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. If you want to qualify the human society with all good qualities, then <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhakti </span>is the only means. Otherwise not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is correct sir. <span class="Italic">Man-manā bhava mad-bhakto. Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So unfortunately nobody is interested. This is the only remedy, and nobody is interested. Rather, they will put blocks in the progress. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If the modern politicians of the world follow the teaching of even <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and <span class="Italic">śanti-parva,</span> there will be <span class="Italic">śanti </span>all over. What is your opinion, sir? That is sufficient if they don't go ahead further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śānti </span>means to become devotee. Otherwise there is no question of.<span class="Italic"> Jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati. </span>That is wanted. If one does not know Kṛṣṇa, where is <span class="Italic">śanti?</span> <span class="Italic">Kuto śanty ayuktasya.</span> Even Dhruva Mahārāja, he was... He became too much restless, being insulted by stepmother. He went to the forest, but there was no <span class="Italic">śanti.</span> He was always restless. Nārada Muni came, advised him that "You are a child. Why you are so much agitated by so-called insult, family talks?" And "No, I don't want your advice." He refused. Then Nārada Muni gave him initiation, that "This boy is very strong." But actually, when he realized God, then he became <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho 'smi varaṁ na yace: [Cc. Madhya 22.42] </span>"My dear Lord, now I am fully satisfied. I have no desire." This is <span class="Italic">śanti</span>. Even <span class="Italic">mokṣa-vaṁcha </span>is not <span class="Italic">śanti</span> because there is demand: "I want <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span>" The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span>, they want sense gratification; the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they want liberation; the <span class="Italic">yogis,</span> they want mystic power, <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-siddhi.</span> Only the devotee, he doesn't want. He wants only to serve Kṛṣṇa. (plane flying over) It is going so low.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is a jumbo.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Hare Kṛṣṇa. (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Shall I go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Can you explain more about the Stita-dhi Muni, the undisturbed sage? In the purport you explain how he is neither attached nor detached. What is that, that he is neither one or the other?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There are two things in this material world, attachment and detachment. Somebody is attached. The <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> everyone, is working. Why so hard? There is attachment. The <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> they are renouncing: <span class="Italic">brahma satya jagan mithya.</span> So a devotee is always satisfied in any condition. He has no attachment or detachment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> He is simply attached to serving Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is attachment, of course, but not for any purpose. He's simply surrendered to Kṛṣṇa, and whatever Kṛṣṇa will do, that's all right. Personally he has no attachment. Suppose Kṛṣṇa wants to do him something which he doesn't like to do; still he has to do. Just as Arjuna... He did not like to fight, but still, because he understood, "Kṛṣṇa wants," then he fought. This is neither attachment nor detachment. Actually it is... It was not liked by him. But he did it because Kṛṣṇa wanted. Therefore, personally he has no attachment or detachment. If Kṛṣṇa is attached to something, then he becomes attached. If Kṛṣṇa is detached to something, he becomes detached. That is<span class="Italic"> bhakta's </span>principle. Personally he is neutral. [break] ...the difference between karmi and bhakta. <span class="Italic">Karmī</span> is attached and detached for his own purpose, and bhakta is attached and detached for Kṛṣṇa's purpose. Personally he has no attachment or detachment. Kṛṣṇa says that, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> There are two kinds of principles: attachment and detachment. So <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja</span>. So this material attachment and detachment one should give up. He should surrender to Kṛṣṇa. This is <span class="Italic">bhakta's </span>principle. So there is no cloud in the sky, eh? Completely clear. [break] ...the sea-going is not dangerous. It is very calm and quiet?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Sea?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sea. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I started during monsoon, (laughs) in September.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's monsoon and then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not September, August.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> August. And in the Atlantic that's the hurricane season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> On the Atlantic Ocean, that's the hurricane season. It's the worst season.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So when I landed in New York-(aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa-the captain said that "It is astonishing there was no hurricane in that line." I did not know. At last, he said. Captain said that he was very much anxious "What will happen in Atlantic? This swami is already seasick." Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such kind of religious system is rejected. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita kaitavaḥ. Kaitava </span>means cheating. To cheat God or to be cheated by God, this kind of religion is rejected. But people are very much fond of that kind of religion by which the God is cheated and he is cheated. He will commit all kinds of sins and he will be excused. That means God is cheated. And if he thinks that "I will go on committing sinful; God will excuse me," that is also cheating. He is cheating himself, as if God is so fool that he will go on committing sin and God will excuse. These are cheating. This is not religion. God is personally speaking, <span class="Italic">yeṣāṁ tv anta-gataṁ pāpaṁ janānāṁ puṇya-karmaṇām</span> [Bg. 7.28]<span class="Italic">,</span> and he is thinking that "I will go on committing sinful activities and God will excuse." Why God will excuse? This is foolishness. He can excuse once, twice, thrice, but as a matter of routine, he will commit sinful activities and God will excuse-this is all nonsense. Parīkṣit Mahārāja has condemned this process. He has compared the <span class="Italic">kuñjara saucavat. Kuñjara </span>means elephant. The elephant takes bath in the river or in the lake very minutely, becomes very clean. And as soon as he will come on the shore, he takes some dust and... You will find this. He's such a big animal, but he has no sense that "Now I have washed all dirty things. Again I am taking dirt?" So this kind of knowledge, that "Cleanse yourself by doing <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta,</span> and again unclean." If you have cleansed yourself, then keep yourself clean. Why you are uncleaning again? This is foolishness. [break] "What is this, pious activities and sinful activities? These are all old, primitive ideas. Now we are advanced."
