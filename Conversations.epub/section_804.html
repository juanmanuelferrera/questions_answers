<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...telling that too much stricture on the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> may cause some disturbance. Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I think the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> themselves should form a small committee and define what they will do, instead of forcing something, because in this age, nobody can follow strictly all the stricture in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think that we formulated anything for them to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Any of our resolutions, it doesn't say anything about what they should do. It simply says what should, how our society should be run, our temples. It doesn't state anything about how the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> should live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No... What? What, was your pro...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Well, last evening we were saying that sex life according to the regulative principles means sex life only when the guru tells the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> to have sex life. And what I said last night is that if that is the case, then there would be no more <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> in the society. They will not... They will not become <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Be practical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that point they can discuss amongst themselves, but that doesn't have anything to do with our resolutions. Right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yeah. This is the idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In other words, our resolutions are on another point, that as far as when they, when they have sex life and when they don't, they should have a committee and they can decide that. But... Resolutions we passed have nothing to do with that. Our resolutions had to do with if someone is not to be supported by the movement, things like this. Those things are a different matter. The actual way the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> should live, that is their... They should decide that by committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaṣodānandana:</span> There now should be a proposition that before they enter the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha āśrama,</span> they should have a means of supporting themselves besides the living off the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That was said...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaṣodānandana:</span> They would...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Those things, the GBC made a resolution...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The resolutions that we made were wrong in that regard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> The resolutions that we made were wrong. Prabhupāda rectified us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In what regard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We made a resolution that if a householder gets married, then he has to take care of his wife for the rest of his life till he takes <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah, Prabhupāda corrected that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah. So that resolution was wrong. And also the resolution about the women and the children coming to the temple, not accepting them, that was also wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So now what's the point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So now they're rectified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So now what is the point?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I'm just saying that we should have a more practical understanding of this, of our attitude towards the whole situation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why Prabhupāda corrected us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I think it may be further decided. Make a small committee of three or four <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas,</span> and you define how you live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, what about their relationship with the society? This point was to... I don't understand why that is being avoided. In other words, how they should live, that they should have a committee for, but the fact that the society cannot support them, that is not for them to decide. That is for the GBC to decide. That is my point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaṣodānandana:</span> I think that point, that's clear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> As far as their living conditions, so let them have a committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah. I agree with that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> All right. Then there's no disagreement. As long as you say we should not disclaim all of our resolutions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, no, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, then it's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda is so merciful that if it comes to a point where it means that a person is not in Kṛṣṇa consciousness or in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, I think Prabhupāda'd rather support them and let them be Kṛṣṇa conscious. That's why you have to see whether they stay in the society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dragging us back to Godhead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When this <span class="Italic">paṇḍal</span> is going to be filled up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> The exhibits should be arriving today with the devotees, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who are these men?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> They are the <span class="Italic">paṇḍal</span> workers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Paṇḍal</span> work... [break] Always, what is called...? Communism. They say, whole world, "We are Communists," "We are capitalists," "We are socialists," and "We are nonviolent," "We are violent."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Dualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Dualism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not dualism. How many <span class="Italic">isms,</span> nobody knows. But... What is called? Faction. Faction. Everyone is divided from the other.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we should not bring that attitude in our society. That is my request.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> Envious. They're all envious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you should not do. And that unity is possible with, only when <span class="Italic">harer nāma</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.21] is there constantly. Otherwise, it will be factional. What do you call? Factional is the right word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes, yes. Factional.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What about the distinction between the enjoying spirit and the renouncing spirit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> For example, there is, as we have been discussing, there is between the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> and the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas...</span> The <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> have this tendency-at least, this is the attitude-towards renunciation. And so far we can see, a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> who gives up his <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> life means he's more inclined towards the enjoying spirit, at least to some extent. So how do we deal with this situation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can... If you want to enjoy, who can stop you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we cannot..., we cannot support it. We cannot support his enjoyment. That he should take on his own self to do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They... According to different position and attitude, the four <span class="Italic">āśramas</span> are there: <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> This means that everyone is not on the equal platform. Different platform. But the whole idea is how to give up the propensity of enjoyment. That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We find in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam</span> that Śukadeva Gosvāmī would approach the householders in the morning just so long as to give them a little bit of spiritual knowledge, and he would accept the offering of some milk. So the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and renunciates, generally, they wouldn't very much relish the association of householders because of this enjoying spirit and the association that it entails. So we're finding also within our society that those who are inclined towards remaining celibate, they're finding the association of persons even within our movement who have this enjoying spirit to be somewhat detrimental to their own spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> <span class="Italic">Gṛhe thāko vanete thāko...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then. What is your proposal? They should go away?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Unless there is association, then they will never become purified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who says they won't asso...? What is this discussion? This is not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It's not a resolution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is not a good discussion either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but this is basically the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, it's not the problem, because everyone comes together in a temple for <span class="Italic">kīrtana,</span> for lectures, for <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> These things are common activities. There's no question that we should not have common activities between all the <span class="Italic">āśramas.</span> These are the common ac... But for living, there must be separate arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, even in the temple, you were complaining, the husband and wife were talking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That's living. That means living. That is not... They're not talking <span class="Italic">Śrīmad Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Separate woman's house, separate man's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is our Indian system. Up to the family they have got separate house for men, separate house for women, separate house for kitchen, separate house for toilet.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> Very nice. Compound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta, we have seen our big, big Mullik family, separate house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> One <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> village, Sharmapur, I went to. They all lived like that. They had five houses in a compound.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. A woman's house, nobody can go. <span class="Italic">Bahir bāri bhitara bāri. Bāhir bāri. Bāhir.</span> Who can understand Bengali?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bāhir?</span> "Outside," isn't it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Bāhir bāri. Bhitar bāri.</span> Then <span class="Italic">pūjār bāri. Rāmnā bāri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Kitchen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, kitchen. Not that within the apartment, all <span class="Italic">bāris.</span> This is European invention.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bāri?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bāri</span> means house. In Gujarat they say <span class="Italic">wādi. Wādi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> <span class="Italic">Wādi, bhajan wādi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is the same thing, <span class="Italic">bāri.</span> In Maharashtra also, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> About attraction and aversion... There's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? Attraction?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> ...a point about attraction and aversion, that there's a complaint that sometimes there's too much aversion on the part of the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> But isn't that not a quality, to a point a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> should have a healthy contempt for sense gratification?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's saying that sometimes the <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs,</span> even the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they may have a very strong aversion towards association with women and/or householder life, things of this nature. And sometimes the <span class="Italic">gṛhasthas</span> will criticize the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> and <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs</span> that "This is fanaticism," or it's, to the other end, "It's just as bad as the enjoying spirit, because you're meditating on the same thing, but only you're averse to it." So what is the...? Bhāgavata dāsa's question is "What is the condition?" Is it better to be neutral or to be averse?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Neutral.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all fanaticism. Real unity is in advancing Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Kalau nāsty eva nāsty eva...</span> In Kali-yuga, you cannot strictly follow, neither I can strictly follow. If I criticize you, if you criticize me, then we go far away from our real life of Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So is it correct to say that if we're not Kṛṣṇa conscious, then if it's not the <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> problem, it would be some other problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll find something or another to absorb our time with besides Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you should always remember that either <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> or <span class="Italic">brahmacārī</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> nobody can strictly follow all the rules and regulations of them. In the Kali-yuga it is not possible. So if I find simply fault with you, and if you find fault with me, then it will be factional, and our real business will be hampered. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has recommended that <span class="Italic">hari-nāma,</span> chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> should be very rigidly performed, which is common for everyone: <span class="Italic">gṛhastha,</span> <span class="Italic">vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> They should always chant Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> Then everything will be adjusted. Otherwise it is impossible to advance. We shall be complicated with the details only. This is called <span class="Italic">niyamāgrahaḥ.</span> I think I have explained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Nectar of Instruction.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Niyamagrahaḥ</span> is not good. <span class="Italic">Niyama</span> means regulative principles. And <span class="Italic">niyama-āgrahaḥ</span> is <span class="Italic">niyamāgrahaḥ. Āgrahaḥ</span> means not to accept. And <span class="Italic">niyama-āgraha. Āgraha</span> means only eager to follow the regulative principles, but no advancement spiritually. Both of them are called <span class="Italic">niyamāgrahaḥ.</span> So the basic principle is that <span class="Italic">niyamāgrahaḥ</span> is not recommended. The real business is that.... And if we advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, simple method, chanting twenty-four hours, <span class="Italic">kīrtanīyaḥ sadā hariḥ</span> [<i class="calibre3">Cc. Ādi </i>17.31]<span class="Italic">,</span> then things will be automatically adjusted. You cannot find in Kali-yuga everything is being done very correctly, to the point. That is very difficult. Just like our poet, Allen Ginsberg. He was always accusing me, "Swamijī, you are very conservative and strict." Actually, I told him that "I am never strict, neither I am conservative. If I become conservative, then I cannot live here for a moment. So I'm not at all conservative." (laughter) I was cooking, and I saw in the, what is called, refrigerator of Yeargen, Yeargon? What is his...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. (sic:) Jergen. That boy you were staying with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, ah! I saw he kept some pieces of meat for his cat. So still, I kept my things in that refrigerator. What can be done? I had no place at that time. <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> [break] ...will be little earlier?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Hm. The walk should be earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Quarter to six. And class beginning quarter to seven. Because the sun is rising earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It's getting warmer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. The foodstuff is supplied very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now it's very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So this should be maintained. Thank you very much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Sufficient, ample, and very tasteful...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ... nutritious. This Santilal is very much accustomed to cooking for devotees, because when Gargamuni was in Calcutta for nearly two years, he was the chief cook there. So he knows just how to, how not to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he cannot give an equal good cook here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, maybe he will be kept here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He's staying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think, personally, he should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> He's coming on the buses with Gargamuni.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhavānanda:</span> He's going...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Variety means beauty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> We were going to bring from New York, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Madhudviṣa Mahārāja will bring next year. Is it very expensive?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guru-kṛpā:</span> No, it's just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, but the computer. You need one computer to run it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. So that is very costly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayapatāka:</span> Computers are very cheap nowadays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yeah, it's very expensive. Actually the electricity would be very expensive, the bill, which would probably be paid by Mahatva(?). (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, if it is very expensive, don't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Of course, an escalator is also expensive. If we're going to worry about expense, then... I think we should wait until we get that big building, the temple, because then, if you put it up there, it can be seen...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> In Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Even in Calcutta. But this is not very high. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> ...ignorance, ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, those who are inclined, they can become. <span class="Italic">Jnanam vijñānam āstikyam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Brahma karma...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So (Hindi or Bengali) <span class="Italic">śūdra-paricaryātmākaṁ kāryam.</span> They should be engaged in serving. But <span class="Italic">sva-karmana tam abhyarcya [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 18.46]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everyone should be engaged in the service of the Lord. That is perfection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Abhyāse samārtho 'si mat-karma-paramo bhava.</span> So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. <span class="Italic">Mat karma paramo...</span> We have got service for everyone. (Bengali) The modern civilization is everyone is sent for academic education. That is mistake, waste of time.</div>
