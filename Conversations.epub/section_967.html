<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When another came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Not in the same way. This city has so many, they have so many different groups, religious groups and minority groups from other parts of the world, they call it a melting pot. So they accept us because they've accepted so many others, the Puerto Ricans, the blacks, so similarly they are accepting us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This city, the people of this city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In other places they consider us to be very foreign, alien. But here there are so many foreigners, so it fits right in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the Tenth Street? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is Amsterdam Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Ninth Avenue turns into Amsterdam Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Next year at the Ratha-yātrā they are planning to have a press box, so that the newspapermen and television cameras can come and film the activities on stage also. They can film your lecture, they can film the play.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're also thinking to have a press box along the parade route, so that they can stay in an elevated position and take photos. We collected a total of about seven thousand dollars, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what you spent?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Spent ten thousand. But we also collected another fifteen thousand in advertisements. So total collection was about twenty, over twenty thousand, and expenditure was under ten.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Good business. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And that was the first year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (chants <span class="Italic">japa</span>)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Next year we will collect sixty to seventy thousand dollars...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Whew!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Easily, I'm sure, with advertisements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where the profit is going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where is the profit? Into distributing more books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is our only business. [break] ...completely cleansed all of the grounds throughout the night, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Last night all night long we were cleaning up the grounds.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> At the park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> At the park. One woman who lives next to the park said "In all my years of living here I've never seen such a wonderful festival held." And one..., the official of the park, who's in charge of the park, was on CBS television, and he said that "You see? Spiritual life is still present in Washington Square Park." He made that comment. He said "We are very proud to be able to say that in our... This park was founded hundreds of years ago, when America was religious." And he said "Spiritual life is still present in Washington Square Park."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not ask the mayor to construct a temple there? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think they'd...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Maybe, but, ah, I don't think they will agree to that. They're not that spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, in America you have to raise your own money for temples. You cannot get the city to build it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, you can't get their land either, not for a building like that. You can put a hospital maybe. Thing is, park space is so short in that area of the city that they..., I don't think they'd give it up for a building. Prabhupāda told us yesterday that we should rent a small building downtown in that area and call it Guṇḍicā, so that Lord Jagannātha will stay down there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For one week.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For one week. And we'll keep a restaurant there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And then they'll again come in procession.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Wow!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, two festivals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> I was told there was another procession last night bringing the car back, and all the night persons-there's a different whole segment of the city, people who come at night...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Bums.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> ...who stay up all night. And they were there, hundreds of people following the car back in the nighttime.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It took about seven hours to bring the carts back. All night they worked. Jayānanda was slaving out there, and Ādi-keśava Swami. Ādi-keśava finally got back at five in the morning, collapsed on the carts, he was exhausted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should be given some recommendations(?) in writing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Give Ādi-keśava a recommendation. This will be gigantic, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'll tell you one thing, that the first way we go, next year when we go one way, it will get huge publicity, and that will be the publicity for the going return trip. Because it will be so publicized, even more people will come on the return ride.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On the return you simply go to the temple and drop the Deities off?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We'll go to Fifty-ninth Street and have another feast at the park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes, there has to be another feast.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll have the feast, we may have buses, we'll have all our buses, and we'll bus the people to the temple. We could rent buses, Rāmeśvara.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Return Ratha-yātrā. <span class="Italic">Ulṭā-ratha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is it called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Ulṭā-ratha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Ulṭā-ratha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Should the actors perform the <span class="Italic">Herā Pañcamī</span> ceremony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is in the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In the middle.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do that(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> So they can do that? [break] ...<span class="Italic">Pañcamī,</span> where they carry the goddess of fortune on an opulent palanquin.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, New York doesn't have a name. We have to give it some name. We call Los Angeles as New Dvārakā. Here it's just New York. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> (whispering) Rādhāvallabha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Rādhāvallabha.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...monkey.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Rādhāvallabha is your faithful servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Guarding you. [break] (outside car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Ghanaśyāma:</span> We were talking about the pictures, the paintings in the books. We were mentioning how professors liked the paintings and how sometimes they actually buy the books because of the nice paintings. Sometimes when we go back to see a professor or librarian a year later, we'll notice that they'll have a catalogue up on the bulletin board. Sometimes they'll take the cover of the jacket of the book and they'll put it on display. And now we're getting recognized when we go to some of the colleges. They say, "Oh, you're the man with the nice colorful books. We've seen your catalogue, we got one in the mail, we've seen your books, and they're very attractive books." And our men are getting known now that because we've been to most of the schools in America once, and they say "You're the men who don't leave until your books are in the library." Even if the school is closed, our men, now, they'll go to the professor's home and they'll get him out of bed to come to see the librarian or to write a notice or to call the librarian. So even if the school is closed, the books are still being placed, and when the students come the books are in the library. [break] (in car)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> Is that what you want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Gurudāsa Mahārāja can speak very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> The speaking starts in the fall, especially. That's when we could work together.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, in our temple.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Satsvarūpa:</span> In the temples also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> Should I not go to the London zone at this time? I've been invited. They say they need a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> in that zone, for years, so I've been invited. Do you think I should go now with Satsvarūpa Mahārāja, or go to London?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you decide among the all of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gurudāsa:</span> All right. Very good. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Yasyāsti bhaktir bhagavaty akiñcanā sarvair guṇais tatra samāsate surāḥ</span> <span class="Italic">[SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> As soon as one becomes devotee, all the good qualification immediately manifest. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> (whispering) ...all these people hanging out and making noise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
