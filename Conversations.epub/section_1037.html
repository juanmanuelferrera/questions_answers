<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa's <span class="Italic">bhakti-nitya-siddha</span> is already there. Otherwise it was not possible to become so successful in the foreign countries. They are not fools, accepting something bogus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa consciousness has succeeded amongst all kinds of religions. It's succeeded amongst all kinds of religions, amongst all kinds of nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> All kinds of economic systems.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat [Bg. </span>7.7]<span class="Italic">.</span>"There is nothing greater than Me." How anything can exceed Kṛṣṇa? You present Kṛṣṇa right, then Kṛṣṇa will exceed anything. Any department of knowledge, any department of activity. Anything. Supreme, <span class="Italic">Parataram. Para-taram. Tara</span> is used-superlative. If our men become serious to distribute... Of course it is not possible that the whole world will be Kṛṣṇa conscious, but at least they will know that there is such a thing. I may know at least there is diamond. I may not be able to purchase. That everyone can know. There is a very valuable jewel. Even though he has not seen it, still he'll appreciate that there is a very valuable jewel known as diamond. That much will also help. When he has got money he can purchase it. [break] Because gentleman will come you have to break this wall. What is this nonsense?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, actually I didn't want it broken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You didn't know but it is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Now they have to finish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any rascal comes, he gives some order. This is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any rascal comes, he's a third-class man, he gives some idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I'm going to get this work finished today definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has no position, he is third-class man. He has given some idea. "Here, you break it." That is the nature. And how long this work will continue? Throughout the whole life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No. I'm going to finish it today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You say no, but it is going on. You simply say no, yes, no, very good. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> When I go away and I come back and the wall is broken what can I do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't manufacture idea. Don't go to (indistinct) others to manufacture ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Right, right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply manufacturing idea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Bombay also they have manufactured idea. One hole, one lift. There is no need, and you have manufactured some idea. Very expert in manufacturing nonsense ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> The thing is how to distinguish between what's a good idea...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have to take ideas from your guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> From intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore <span class="Italic">gurum evābhigacchet.</span> Why do you manufacture yourself? Consult the authority. Then do it. That is intelligence. Why do you think that you are very intelligent? That is materialism. The more you remain that "I am a fool," that is good. And as soon as you become over-intelligent, then, that's finished. So Europeans, Americans, they are over-intelligent. They have intelligence, over-intelligence. Unnecessarily. They manufacture a machine for shaving. <span class="Italic">Gnowgnowgnow gnowgnow </span>(makes machine sound). (Laughter) And they have wasted so much time. So much time. But people like it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, if we don't use soap, the question has come up, how to wash the clothes. How to wash the cloth. If you do not use any soap, the question has come up, how to wash cloth. By beating only? Sufficient?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For washing cloth you require soap. But does not... You require everything, but because you are spending without any sense... So I calculated yesterday the whole thing, Deity worship, Deity <span class="Italic">pūjā</span>, will require five hundred rupees per month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I had requested for the flowers, Viśvambhara said twelve rupees you had decided last night.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Twelve rupees, thirteen rupees...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Twelve, thirteen. Actually today, I wanted for today but the flower man was not able to... We could not catch him in time. But from tomorrow it will start, definitely.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The thing is that one who is cheating you, he will cheat in twelve rupees, also he will cheat in fifty rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He knows how to cheat you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, they're expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where do they get flowers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> There are two flower men. They come here from Bankibehari. Now Viśvambhara has made two, because they make a competition between each other and therefore they keep down. But...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nobody is honest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But still old flowers are coming. Still, old flowers are coming. We're getting cheap, but old ones are coming. Brown flowers, old ones are coming. It's just by experience, Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where they get flower?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Wherefrom? The actual flower men? I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In the market the flowers are not sold?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know. Viśvambhara said that this was the best. Viśvambhara is very expert. He's supremely expert at catching these cheaters. But even he gets cheated sometimes. Even things go by and he doesn't notice. He's very, very expert. If I ever get to be as expert as him, then maybe something good will happen. But even he is also being cheated sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cheating is one of the qualification of the conditioned soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Prabhupāda, Viśvambhara...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vipralipsa, vipralipsa. Bhrama, pramada, vipralipsa, karuṇātmikā.(?)</span> So cheating is a qualification of the conditioned soul. Everyone is expert in cheating more or less. That is qualification. People take pride, "Oh, I have cheated. I am so expert that I have cheated." When the lawyers make some agreement between the two lawyers, simply think "How I can cheat you. How can I cheat you." That's all. The more one lawyer is expert in cheating, he is big lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Yes, because their business is to avoid the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They are called lawyer but their business is to break the law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The best cheater is the best lawyer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So that means if we become pure then we can avoid being cheated because we ourselves will not cheat anymore.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this world is full of cheaters. We have to live with them. <span class="Italic">Sate sattvaṁ samācaret.</span> You also have to become better cheater. That is wanted. Otherwise, you cannot exist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But we have to cheat for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do everything for Kṛṣṇa, that is all right, but this world, if you become simple and the whole world is full of cheaters, then you suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> You lose everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you have to know and protect yourself from the cheaters. So sometimes we have to become a bigger cheater. This is the world. <span class="Italic">Vañcaka-vañcī.</span> Whole world is going on, my Guru Mahārāja used to say that one is cheater, another is cheated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There's a saying in English... What is it? Set a thief to catch a thief. The purport is that you have to think like a thief, then you can catch him, you can know what he's doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Set a fish?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Set a thief to catch a thief.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thief, oh yes. You can reply him... [break] Those who are actually serious to advance in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they are welcome.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pāpī-tāpī jata chilo.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If he's serious to become free from this material world and go back to home, back to..., you welcome him. We don't make any discrimination. <span class="Italic">Ābāla-vṛddha-vanitā. Bāla</span> means children. <span class="Italic">Vṛddha</span> means old man, and <span class="Italic">vanitā</span> means woman. They are most helpless. <span class="Italic">Ābāla-vṛddha-vanitā. Vanitā.</span> Beginning from the child up to the old man, and... But coming here, if they plan for sense gratification, that is very dangerous. Come here, stay with us. We shall somehow or other provide him with <span class="Italic">prasāda</span> and place, but be advanced. And the simple method is recommended,</div>
<div class="Verse">yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe<br class="calibre2"/>bhaktir utpadyate puṁsaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>śoka-moha-bhayāpahā<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>1.7.7]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Very simple. <span class="Italic">Yasyāṁ vai śrūyamāṇāyām.</span> Simply hear <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> And actually if anyone seriously reads <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> he'll become saintly, no doubt about it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Your <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata.</span> There are no others actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Vyāsadeva, the words of Vyāsadeva. I am simply trying to explain, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No one else is trying. No one else has done it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is due to the blessing of my Guru Mahārāja. He directly told me that "If you get some money, publish some books." I took it seriously, so he's helping me. All our Godbrothers, they didn't take it. Did not know it, neither... Even they... They know it. Because from the very beginning, Guru Mahārāja was serious about publication. He started press and published these books. This <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> was published by him. And the journal, six journals, he was very much fond of publishing, publication. Very, very. He told me directly that if it was possible to get the marbles from this Gauḍīya Maṭha and sell it and convert it into books, I would have done it. Because I know there will be blazing fire in this place. [break] And by Kṛṣṇa's grace, by selling books we are getting. This is Kṛṣṇa's grace. Otherwise... This Bon Mahārāja is so proud of his institution. He could not do this. He could have done it. For the last forty years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He does not speak <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā,</span> Prabhupāda. So five thousand you have estimated for the Deities? For a month you have estimated last night five thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Five hundred. For all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> For a month?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> With Viśvambhara you have discussed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then I'll talk to him now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we were going to in the evening... Don't divert attention. In the evening we have estimated four plates. Each plate eight <span class="Italic">puris</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Six plates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six plates. Six plates, eight <span class="Italic">puris</span> means forty-eight <span class="Italic">puris.</span> Forty-eight <span class="Italic">puris,</span> Viśvambhara calculated the <span class="Italic">āṭā</span> and <span class="Italic">ghee.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, you already made that estimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Two rupees. <span class="Italic">Āṭā</span> and <span class="Italic">ghee,</span> two rupees. Then other preparation, another two rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He'll tell me everything Prabhupāda. No need to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why don't you hear? You are hearing now. Four rupees to prepare all the plates. Four rupees, say five rupees. So five rupees, monthly 150 rupees. So we are offering four times. So 150 rupees four times.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Six hundred rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Six hundred rupees. So take another four hundred rupees, make one thousand. It should not go more than five hundred to one thousand. You spend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But milk, when you cook down milk to make a sweet...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have taken from six hundred to one thousand. All the maintenance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I will take every item with Viśvambhara, every single item.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't believe me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I can't understand. My intelligence is not great enough to understand it. I believe you, but I have to do it. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It cannot go more than one thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I can't quite grasp it, Prabhupāda. But you say it can't go above five hundred, so that'll be it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Five hundred, that is rough calculation. But we add another five hundred, if there is any mistake or any error and omission. Therefore I have added another five hundred.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That means a thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Thousand. That is sufficient.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Maximum.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Maximum. And you were speaking 9,000.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> This is for food. Food only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is for Deity messing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Deity food only. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So I am speaking of the Deity, not for all. For all others hundred rupees per head, five thousand rupees. Here <span class="Italic">puri, kacuris,</span> and other things, all the best things. But general is not for <span class="Italic">puri, kacuri,</span> and... They are general food. We are not going to supply <span class="Italic">puri, kacuri, halavā</span> to everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> No, never. Never have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Only for the Deity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Others are just <span class="Italic">dāl, sabji,</span> rice, <span class="Italic">cāpāṭi.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything. Everything calculated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I believe you, Prabhupāda. But to make it practical I want to see every item. The cost, the weight, and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already calculated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Then I can do it. Then we can do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is already calculated. I calculated not with a fool. With an experienced man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have one other question regarding... We are going to observe very strict policies. Unless somebody is working he cannot stay in the temple. If some other tourist devotee comes from some other center, he can only stay for three days. But beyond that he should either pay or he should go and preach or do something else. What should we do with, like there's some <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> here, like Yaśodānandana Swami and his party. I hear they're going to stay for the whole month. They're already here since two weeks. They're occupying two rooms, everything. They're going to stay here till the end of the month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Get him to go and preach for Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The only reason I'm talking this is because now it's really tight. We can't take... They have air conditioned room...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they should go and preach and bring some collection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They're just relaxed, resting for a month.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> A month is too long, Prabhupāda said. Prabhupāda said three days a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> should stay and then he should go and travel. The wheels should be turning. I'll talk to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because this just adds up. A ten people party staying here for a month...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they've always come, so there must be some control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Few men are here from Haṁsadūta's party who eat with us. All this just adds up then our budget cannot be maintained.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I'll preach to him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Air conditioned room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another thing. They're our men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. It's required. If anyone's ever done a big preaching program, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But one month...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> A month is a long time. Maybe a week. But a month...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Week is sufficient. One month is too much. That is laziness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Residential. Laziness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So he was preaching in the South India, so why he came here? There was no resting place?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He came here... Actually they're going north soon. They're going to be in Chandigarh when we're in Chandigarh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is six weeks from now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's all right. They're also going north and preaching and he's having a very hard time getting his financial position down. He has no men. Two, three, four men. He's having...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he'll return my fifteen thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That Mahāṁsa has taken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I do not know Mahāṁsa's taken. He has to return it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He never got it. And he wanted to join with Haṁsadūta, do some type of (indistinct). He's not in a very easy position right now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He could become a part of Vṛndāvana and take a team out of Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I always wanted that Vṛndāvana should have one bus. That is to say if there is not too much endeavor to get one bus. There's so many buses floating are through the air. Why could Vṛndāvana not have one bus? In that way they can always be just like Kīrtanānanda Swami. There is always <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana</span> going and coming, going and coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ānanda Swami?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Kīrtanānanda in New Vrindaban. All his people, they must go out and do <span class="Italic">kīrtana</span> and distribute books. They must. Everybody does it. In that way, I'm told this anyway. In that way the devotees are enlivened and they don't become restless in the temple. Then the same ones... It's our bus, and they will come back to our temple. So we will not lose so many good devotees because they will not be attracted to go away on others. So if we had one bus... Yaśodānandana Mahārāja I will discuss with him. I already have, I'll just try to discuss it more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Gurudāsa Swami is coming to Vṛndāvana with a bus. He said he's going to give it to Vṛndāvana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And there's no need for me to go out. There's so many nice <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> So many big preachers and so many buses. So if we just try it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Īśvara Candra prabhu has come from Mathurā. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When you will come to preach something. You take it from me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Īśvara Candra:</span> Last one and a half year I'm trying for something in Mathurā but I'm...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are trying in your own way. But Kṛṣṇa does not like that program. You can manufacture your something, idea, but Kṛṣṇa will allow or not. I tell you. This is practical. You are a qualified man, foreign educated man, and you have come back for the last one and a half years, still you are in nothing. It is surprising. That means Kṛṣṇa does not want you to do that something. You take it from me. These boys have come because they found, outside Kṛṣṇa consciousness, life is nothing. That's a fact. Therefore they are sticking to this. They knew it very well. That outside Kṛṣṇa consciousness the whole world was vacant, "Nothing for us." That is a fact. Therefore they have got something here. They are not foolish rascals, they're sticking for nothing. There is something. It's a fact. So for nothing, "Oh, we have suffered." And come to something. If you want. That's Prāṇava, he is trying for something. He has come also to Vṛndāvana more than one year or two. Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Two, three years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> More than that. Three and a half years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And he's trying to do something. The same "something." He was at home, the same woman and same man. And again also here the same woman and man, and trying to do something. But he has no customer. He has only customer how to cheat these Europeans and Americans. <span class="Italic">Surmā</span> merchant. As if <span class="Italic">surmā </span>is not available in the market. And he advertises "This is my special formula, and this is this, this is this. You take it and give me five hundred rupees and go away." He cannot sell outside. Otherwise, why he's sticking to Vṛndāvana? Thinking the fools and rascals the Americans are. I shall introduce. (Hindi) That this material world has become nothing. You come to something. (Hindi) If anyone wants to go to Bhagavān then he has to make this material world voluntarily nothing. <span class="Italic">Niṣkiñcanasya. Niṣkiñcana</span> means nothing. You understand, you translate. You know the meaning of <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana. Kiñ-cana</span> means something and <span class="Italic">niḥ</span> means not. Then nothing. So one who has made this material world as nothing. How it is made? <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because with this something, as soon as one will stick to this something, he'll suffer. <span class="Italic">Sadā samudvigna-dhiyām asad-grahāt [SB </span>7.5.5]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because he has accepted this rascal situation, <span class="Italic">asat</span>. <span class="Italic">Asat</span> means either temporary or bad. <span class="Italic">Asat.</span> (Hindi) Temporary or useless. So this material world is... Temporary we can know it is. But it is useless, that we do not know. Therefore we struggle. "Let me go, let me fight, fight, fight, fight." That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> (Hindi) You know that? A man is sitting on the ass. And his hand just on the front of the <span class="Italic">gādhā,</span> ass, he's putting some grass. And the <span class="Italic">gādhā</span> is thinking, "I will eat this grass," he's going forward. But the grass is also going forward. This is very instructive. The grass is, say one feet above his head. And the man is sitting on his back. But because this <span class="Italic">gādhā</span> does not know that "Actually this man is sitting on my... As soon as I go forward, the grass also goes forward." But because he's ass, he does not know. He thinks that "If I go a little forward I'll get the grass." But he has no knowledge that the arrangement is so made that as you go forward the grass also goes forward. Another example is that meerage, myrage? There is no water.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mirage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mirage. There is no water. It appears there is water, and the animal goes forward and it goes forward, it goes forward. So this material world is like that. Ask anybody, any so-called successful. Unless he's an ass, nobody will say that this is very comfortable. So best thing is to become <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana. Niṣkiñcanasya bhāgavata-bhajana...</span> This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction. <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata-bhajana</span> means <span class="Italic">niṣkiñcana.</span> You make nothing this material world. That is real Kṛṣṇa consciousness. And so long I'll make this material world something, then I'll suffer. Best thing is make it... Just like Draupadī. Draupadī, when she was grabbed in the assembly and Duryodhana and Karṇa wanted to make her naked. So generally woman, if you try to make her naked she'll try to save herself. So she was trying to save herself and when she thought, "There is no way. My husbands are here. They are not helping, and..." So cloth is being supplied by Kṛṣṇa, but how long I shall? No, before Kṛṣṇa helping, she was trying to help herself. But when she found that it is not possible, then she did not try to save the cloth. She said, "Kṛṣṇa, save me!" Two arms. You have seen the picture. And then Kṛṣṇa supplied cloth. So it is, "Go on, yes, Duḥśāsana, you go on. You try to make her naked. I'll supply." So this is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's instruction, that one should, if one is serious about <span class="Italic">bhagavad-bhajana,</span> he should take it, whole material world, as nothing. Sometimes I think, I made nothing this material world, and again retired in Vṛndāvana. Again Kṛṣṇa, you have given so many things. What is the purpose? At that time, I remember Rūpa Gosvāmī's instruction. "This is not mine. This is Kṛṣṇa's." <span class="Italic">Nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgya.</span> We are exerting so much energy to construct a temple, but as soon as we become implicated, "Now I have got this big building. Let me live very comfortably." Then it is very dangerous. So long we work for Kṛṣṇa, it is Kṛṣṇa's, I am still nothing. And as soon as I take it, "Oh, now I have got very good, comfortable place. Make me again something." Take that as dangerous. Otherwise, there is no danger. Therefore we have to be engaged always in Kṛṣṇa's service. Not that "Because we have got this nice building and income also, let us now sit down and eat." Then you'll stop. You shall have to be engaged always. Because our brain is materialistic, as soon as there is little chance of utilizing for sense gratification, mind: "Yes, yes. Do it." Still, we have to do it. <span class="Italic">Prāpañcikatayā buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgaḥ phalgu vairāgyam kathyate.</span> Rūpa Gosvāmī. <span class="Italic">Hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ.</span> Things which are connected to Kṛṣṇa, you should never think it that it is material. It is spiritual. (Hindi) Jagāi Mādhāi... Caitanya Mahāprabhu asked him that you make this nothing, this sinful activity, then I accept you. They promised, "Yes." (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyaḥ</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span>" (Hindi) What is your ambition? What is the ambition? Huh? Then again nothing? There must be something. Why you are sticking to that company. There must be some ambition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Īśvara Candra:</span> I want to take care of my family what...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how you can take care with nothing? Kṛṣṇa makes you nothing, then how you can take care of your family? <span class="Italic">Bālasya neha śaraṇaṁ pitarau nārtasya ca...</span> These things I have explained. That we have got so many means against struggle for existence, but that is not final. <span class="Italic">Tāvat tanu-bhṛtāṁ tvad-upekṣitānām.</span> If there is no sanction from Kṛṣṇa, you cannot do it. It is impossible. If Kṛṣṇa does not like you to be implicated in that way, that is false, then how can you do it? You are thinking that I shall take care of my family. But if Kṛṣṇa wants that you cannot take care of your family then how you'll do it? Can you go against the will of Kṛṣṇa? You can understand at least this, if not very much advanced. You cannot go against the will of Kṛṣṇa. So you have tried for the last one and a half years, you could not improve your material situation. That means you are going against the will of Kṛṣṇa. Take it from me. <span class="Italic">Kata bāccā?</span> Four (Hindi) Separate. No more together. (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything is discussed in the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam. Kṛpaṇa, brāhmaṇa, kṛpaṇa, tṛpyanti neha.</span> He knows that one <span class="Italic">bāccā</span> has given me so much trouble. Illicit or legal, (Hindi) it is troublesome business. Otherwise why these Americans and Europeans, they're killing their own child. They don't want to take the botheration. (Hindi) So it is botheration, there is no doubt about it. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇāḥ.</span> The <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> (Hindi) What is the meaning of <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa?</span> Do you know? Miser. Miser, what is the meaning of miser? Yes. We have got this something, human form of body, to develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Instead of doing that, in spite of possessing this something, I am utilizing it for sense gratification. If you want sense gratification that's all right. Get one child, two child. Why again and again? Therefore <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇāḥ.</span> Because he's <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa,</span> he's never satisfied. He's suffering-again, another child, again, another child. All right, you have got two child, one child, that's all right. Be satisfied. Why again and again? The <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa. Kṛpaṇa,</span> he does not know how to utilize this asset of human life. He's wasting the asset in a different way. <span class="Italic">Kṛpaṇa.</span> One has to become <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> The opposite word of <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā [Bg. </span>18.54]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is wanted. So we are giving <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> position. Instead of taking the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> position, if he wants to take again <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa</span> position, then what is the use of being initiated? All these great sages, saintly person, who were they? They were all <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas. Brāhmaṇa.</span> Śukadeva Gosvāmī is always addressed, <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> Is it not? This is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa's</span> business. It is not the <span class="Italic">kṛpaṇa's</span> business. <span class="Italic">Kṛpaṇa's</span> business means he does not know how to utilize the asset. So (Hindi) it is my duty to speak the truth. So now you can do whatever you like... Give him <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> [Break] ...these words, <span class="Italic">tṛpyanti neha kṛpaṇā bahu-duḥkha-bhājaḥ.</span> They have been described, it is just like... Of course, it is very difficult, this itching. We have got practical experience. When there is some itching, we cannot stop it. We cannot stop it. Even if I do not want it, still... So it is like itching. Nothing more. <span class="Italic">Kaṇḍūyanena karayor iva duḥkha-duḥkham.</span> The <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> means how to control this itching sensation. This is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">. Tapasya</span> means, <span class="Italic">tapasya</span> begins, now <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> That is <span class="Italic">tapasya. Tapasya</span> means <span class="Italic">brahmacārī. Tapasā brahmacaryeṇa śamena damena, tyāgena, satya-śaucābhyāṁ yamena niyamena [SB </span>6.1.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span> It is very strong power, this... Therefore <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> said that this power, sex power, is there in the hogs. They have no discrimination between mother, sister, daughter. And simply busy. The example is given. This capacity is there in the hog. Are you hog? How example is given. Do you like to remain like a hog? One should be saintly. Yes. Then where is the difference, I'm a human being? I am treating like hog. Therefore this very example. <span class="Italic">Nāyaṁ deho deha-bhājāṁ nṛloke kaṣṭān kāmān arhate viḍ-bhujām [SB </span>5.5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is for the hogs. This hog civilization is going on as human civilization. That is the difficulty. Whole world is hogs and dogs. Big, big United Nations. And what are the assembly? Hogs and dogs. The politicians, as soon as he gets some time for relax, immediately he becomes hogs. Go to the hotel, prostitute, and drink and dance. Is it not? All politicians. You become a big hog. That's all. Without becoming politician, a small hog. Because they have got politi..., big hog. So how you can expect prosperity from these big hogs? After all he's hog. What benefit you can derive from this hogs, assembly of hogs, United Nations? United hogs. You cannot expect. He's hog. Now they're making propaganda for sterilization, and if we advise make a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī-āśrama</span> from the beginning, they will not take. "What is this nonsense, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī?"</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Is it because they cannot? Do they reject it because they cannot do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They can. They'll not accept the process. They can. Everyone. Otherwise why these <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs?</span> Just to be trained. That's all. By training we can find so many <span class="Italic">brahmacārīs.</span> Just like by training you have given up so many things. You were accustomed to this illicit sex and meat-eating and... But you have given up. But why? By training. So if we request the government, "Let us open this <span class="Italic">brahmacārī...</span>" They'll not help. But they'll make the other propaganda. They'll make contraceptive method, and naturally one Hindu widow is trained up not to marry again. Once she got a husband, that's all right. Now you convert your, you divert your attention to Kṛṣṇa. They'll make propaganda. "Why stop her sense gratification? Let her marry again, widow marriage." Why widow marriage? If there is voluntarily giving up begetting any more child, to avoid husband, why the widow marriage bill is introduced? Everything was natural, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> The sterilization is already there. That will not be accepted. Widow, she's remaining refrained from. Just like we have now asked our girls not to dress attractively, widow. They should dress not attractively. Because after all, what is this sex enjoyment? It is not very good thing. By outward attraction they attract. Nice sari, nice,-one becomes attracted. Therefore this is psychology, that if the woman does not dress very nicely, she will not be attractive. Unnecessarily attraction she will avoid. But a woman is naturally, her psychology is dress very nicely so that man may be attracted. Because they want shelter. This is the whole psychology. They, although they declare independence, they cannot live independently. That is not possible. Therefore they are by nature accustomed to dress attractively so that one may accept her and give her shelter. This is psychology. Otherwise, why the woman are naturally inclined to dress herself nice. Man does not. This is the psychology. A boy, sixteen years old boy, he does not... He is roughly dressed, he does not... But a sixteen year old girl will never remain roughly. She'll always try to decorate herself very nicely and utilize her youthful beauty for attracting. Why attracting? Because she wants shelter. Therefore it is the duty of the father and mother that she is young girl, she wants shelter, and out of passion, lusty desires, her selection may be wrong. So before she selects out of her own way, let me, it is my duty, I am guardian. Give her some good shelter. This is Hindu process.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Perfectly natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> But they say restricting. But they will say restricting, unnatural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They may say, but this is natural psychology. Father, mother, they know, the well-wisher of the children. Now everything is spoiled. But we don't care for this. We say take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness, everything will be adjusted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> By sterilization, Prabhupāda... When they perform some operation that will also spoil their intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is spoiled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Because if the, as I have read, if the semina can go to the brain then there can be some intelligence, if even a little could go. Is it by sterilization no more can go to the brain I think. So they have become <span class="Italic">balada.</span> [oxen] They've become like the <span class="Italic">balada.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays boys are dull. Why dull?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So dull in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everywhere. Because they discharge semina like anything. Must be dull.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And then by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Uddhareta.</span> There is a word <span class="Italic">uddhareta. Reta</span> means semina. One who has learned how to divert the movement of the semina to the brain. <span class="Italic">Uddhareta.</span> Greatest yogis. By yogic power they can do that. Instead of discharging, going down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So if they become sterilized then there's no more possible for the semina to go up. Never again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Semina will not be produced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It cannot, therefore it cannot go, nothing can go to the brain. Therefore their brain is finished for life. It is the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anything you do artificially...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It is just like making an operation on the brain. Sterilization is therefore the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Kali-yuga is... The material world is for suffering. Kali-yuga is more suffering. But it is not fault of the... Just like this <span class="Italic">bābājī</span> has been sterilized. Because the government knows, even the so-called <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> and <span class="Italic">bābājīs,</span> they are using their sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Bābājī</span> has been...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Sterilized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, I know. I heard about it. Because they are having sex.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is open secret. Because so many women go to hospitals, American hospitals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh, I know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The hospital men, they do not take it serious, "It is natural, a man and woman." But it is strictly forbidden according to spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> By law the doctor has to perform so many operations in his day of practice, medical practice. One doctor came here, he was our main member. He said, "I have to go back to practice now. I have so many cases, sterilizations to perform in this day. Otherwise I won't get paid. I will not be able to live now. Because I must perform so many..." Large figure. I've forgotten how many. Maybe one dozen in one day. One dozen, fifteen in one day. He must perform by law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Terrible. I often think it's like the <span class="Italic">balada.</span> The <span class="Italic">balada</span> they have, with the <span class="Italic">balada gadi(?)</span> and they cut. And the <span class="Italic">balada</span> has no brain. He does anything you want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> What's a <span class="Italic">balada?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> The oxen. And similarly the people. [break] There must be a war very soon. It seems that there must be war very soon. War may happen very soon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There will be reaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Such a transgression of the laws, it cannot... How much further can it go, Prabhupāda? There must be a war very soon. Any day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I think they cannot ask you for sterilization. You are foreigners.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Ask us for sterilization.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, right. That's what I thought.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This argument. "First of all finish my..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I had two when I was married.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, we are <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> We have no children. So why you are coming to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> They've never come fortunately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They can only do that to their own citizens. They can only do that to Indian citizens.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foreigners...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So if I become Indian national, if I learn Hindi and become Indian national then they will approach me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> That can never happen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I just heard that seventy thousand women and thirty-six thousand men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nas-bandhi,</span> they call it. <span class="Italic">Nas-bandhi.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was just in one state.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Veins! I didn't know that. <span class="Italic">Bandhi</span> means stop it. Stop the vein so the semina will not go. Terrible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You're sure about that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They told you that's what they're doing. Stops you producing... They cut the tube that produces semina.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I don't know where they do it. Some part of the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> It's somewhere near the testes. They cut the tube. It takes ten minutes. And it stops you producing any more semina.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It's so bad. They give people... [break] ...and eating so much nonsense. So the preaching in India has to be done very, very tactfully.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, just like I was speaking from <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Just what you have spoken. But our actions must be very tactful also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you speak only on the subject matter as it is mentioned in the books, it is already tactful. <span class="Italic">Yasyāṁ śrūyamāṇāyāṁ kṛṣṇe parama-pūruṣe, bhaktir utpadyate puṁsaḥ śoka-moha-bhayāpahā.</span> Now they are in a position of <span class="Italic">śoka-moha-bhaya.</span> So you take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. This is the best tact. Now it is the time. Now they are put into <span class="Italic">śoka-moha-bhaya.</span> It is already there going on, <span class="Italic">śoka-moha-bhaya.</span> But it is now special time for <span class="Italic">śoka-moha-bhaya.</span> So you have to take it. It may be out of fear, <span class="Italic">bhaya,</span> they may take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Still, they have to just take, that's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Catur-vidhā bhajante māṁ janāḥ sukṛtino 'rjuna ārto</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg.</i> 7.16]<span class="Italic">, ārto. Ārtaḥ</span> means who is afraid of. So this is the position of <span class="Italic">ārta, śoka-moha-bhaya.</span> Take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. But that he can take provided he is <span class="Italic">sukṛtina,</span> if there is background. But still, by hearing Hare Kṛṣṇa he becomes <span class="Italic">sukṛtina.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I think most of the devotees became by fear. I think most of the devotees have become devotees because of fear.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fear must be. If he's a gentleman he must be afraid of this material world. That is very good qualification. If one is afraid of this material existence, it is very good symptom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Just about every devotee, before coming to you, has thought about suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suicide? Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So many, I know I have spoken with them. And myself included.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, there was no hope. What is the use.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes. Just about every devotee, they have thought of suicide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they commit suicide. I have seen. Fall from the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Skyscraper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Tower. From the bridge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They have to put big wire screens up to stop people from jumping off.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Berkeley.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Berkeley, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Everywhere. Sydney has bridges like that. These big towers like Eiffel Tower in Paris, they have big fences along the top so that no one can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This practice is there in Vedic system. Not Vedic system, (indistinct), fall down. There is technical name. Fall down from the mountain. This is easier than other type of suicide. Because you simply once jump, but as soon as you fall, you forget everything. Suicide itself is very bad. This fall down, <span class="Italic">serotan</span> (?) it is called.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> So one question I wanted to ask you in this connection, is that this Vinobha, fasting until death, until cow slaughter is stopped. So if he dies then he is guilty of murder. Is it correct. And if he's a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he is guilty of <span class="Italic">brahma-hatya.</span> So by this fasting he is committing a greater sin than the actual killing of the cows.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And what is the gain?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what he'll get it? Does he think that by his dying of starvation this cow-killing will be stopped? That is his foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> He will die and it will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is his foolishness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> And he does not know where he will go next.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, he is (Hindi), very big man, and he's such a rascal. He has no sense what he is doing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Plainly you have described in the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> You have described plainly in the <span class="Italic">Gītā.</span> No one else has done that. Cinmayananda's, this, that rascal, no one has. No one has explained that. They don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, anyone who is not in our disciplic succession, he's not a human being. Cinmayananda, Vivekananda, this<span class="Italic">-ānanda,</span> they simply... <span class="Italic">Ānanda,</span> there is no <span class="Italic">ānanda.</span> All <span class="Italic">nirānanda.</span> What Cinmayananda? He is supposed to be very big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> what he has done?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> What has he done? He advertised in the paper for young boys.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is one gentleman, Sadajivatra in Bombay. You know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Sadaji Mahatma?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sadajivatra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Oh yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I know of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is very intelligent. He has said to a friend, that Bhaktivedanta Swami (Hindi) <span class="Italic">Kāla</span> means, that he has made all other so-called <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> yogis, black-faced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> (laughs) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> He is intelligent.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bhaktivedanta Swami <span class="Italic">sata mukala.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> It's true. It's true.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now here is a big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> Akhandanandan, or Bon Maharaja. They are supposed to be big, big <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> I do not know what Akhandanandan does.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, (indistinct) And this Anandamaya<span class="Italic">.</span> Actually I am not proud, but what they have done in comparison to me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Yes, they've done nothing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has said <span class="Italic">sata mukala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mukala.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Kāla. Kāla</span> means <span class="Italic">lajjita.</span> Black face. Everyone should be ashamed. They may be envious on account of their failure, but if you come to the actual valuation, <span class="Italic">sata mukala.</span> That's a fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Actually, that Bon Maharaja is very black anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He's so black, there is no more black required. (laughter) A black snake. (Bengali) In Bengal it is said if a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is black he is dangerous.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> If a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is black?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means he's not pure <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa. Brāhmaṇa</span> cannot be black. Just like a European, if he becomes black, that means he has mixture. European and American, if he's black, that means mixture. So <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, how it has... Still, family, it must be very fair. <span class="Italic">Śukla. Brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya</span> family must be very beautiful. If he's pure. <span class="Italic">Kāla brāhmaṇa prakāśa śūdra</span> (Bengali) <span class="Italic">beki poṣya-putro pasaraila.(?)</span> It is a slang language. <span class="Italic">Kāla brāhmaṇa.</span> <span class="Italic">Brāhmaṇa</span> should not be black and <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> should not be white. And a Musselman should not be dwarf. Because formerly real Musselmen were coming from Kabul, Afghanistan. That is called (indistinct). If a Muslim is dwarf that means he is not real. (Bengali) Prostitute's son, and <span class="Italic">poṣya-putra,</span> adopted son. They are all of the same class. How this selection? Black <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> white <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> dwarf Musselman, and prostitute's son, and adopted son. Adopted son, he gets money without any earning and spends like... I have seen so many adopted sons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Adopted son, oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Just like our, Haṁsadūta's wife, what is name? She has adopted a son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Oh, Himāvatī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Himāvatī. It is not like that. But generally adopted son means spoiled son.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Spoiled. Spoiled brat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because he gets money. One who has got money but no children, he takes some adopted son. So the adopted son thinks that "I have got so much money," and he has never worked. He is spoiled. I have seen many adopted son, our... Got <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> and <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees, and in one night he's spoiled everything. Simply after woman and wine. I have seen it. There was one gentleman, Narendranath Singh. Very big, palatial building and very rich man. And I have seen him when he was finished. He was friend of big, big person, Raja Maharlel (?). And one day I saw in Calcutta, there was raining and he was sitting in a rickshaw. And no friend. He had known practically all big men of Calcutta friend. Nobody is coming. "Well Narendra, you are sitting. Come on in my car." Nobody. I was (indistinct). And he was drenching, there was heavy rain. And sitting a... And he was keeping Rolls Royce car.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Keeping?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rolls Royce. When he was rich man.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Sometimes while traveling I've met some very old rich men lying on their deathbed dying. I approached them to help us. They will not give a single penny. It is all going to the son, and the son is atheist. In the house there is everywhere Kṛṣṇa's picture. Very difficult. They don't know that Kṛṣṇa is giving them a chance. They die, within days some of them can die. They are lying on the bed, passing stool and urine. So rich. But they do not care to help this movement. So many people like that. We have to become very expert. (end)</div>
