<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...mind, don't express. Don't disclose. And besides that, we should not think anyone as our enemy. They are misled. Let us do our own duty. Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa... Who has broken this? [Break] ...disease. Just like a man is diseased, and a surgeon is operating. He's calling by ill names, "You rascal, you <span class="Italic">śālā,</span> you <span class="Italic">barja(?),</span> you are killing me." So that does not mean he'll stop his business. And when he's relieved: "Oh, you are my friend. You have done so good. You are not my <span class="Italic">śālā.</span>" Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Why do they say <span class="Italic">"śālā"</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Śālā</span> is a abominable term. <span class="Italic">Śālā</span> means wife's brother.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The country, you see? But advanced devotee, they'll not think anyone as enemy. You see? Diseased man... <span class="Italic">piśācī pāile yena mati-cchanna haya, māyā-grasta jīvera haya se bhāva udaya.</span> Just like one is ghostly haunted. He talks all nonsense.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> If you back and forward another man to... Usually it's in entertainment, to be a famous actor or a singer, then a man will be behind, supplying money and publicity and everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...well, let them translate all our English literature. We shall publish in Bengali.</div>
