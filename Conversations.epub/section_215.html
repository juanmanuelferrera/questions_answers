<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What you play?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Woman:</span> I just, er, um, I cook.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> I play the dulcimer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What's that?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Dulcimer?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi(?):</span> Dulcimer.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> It has strings, four strings, and it's shaped like that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, just like tambura.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Tambura.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like tambura.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It's more like a vina. [break]</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you understand our philosophy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I don't know if I understand it, but I'm reading it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. What is your philosophy?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No philosophy of life? Why you are living?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I don't know. I was just born.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Born-everyone is born. Cats and dogs are also born. They also live, they also die. So if we live like that-"I was born. Let me live somewhere, and die''-then what is the difference?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> None.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. There is difference. That one should understand. There is difference. A man should not live like cats and dogs, because he has got a mission.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Mission?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mission. That mission is God realization. Cats and dogs cannot do it; human beings can do it. Therefore in any civilized human society, there is a type of religion. May be Christian religion or Mohammedan religion or Hindu religion or Buddhist-there is religion. But you cannot find this religious system in the animal kingdom of life. That is the difference. If we give up this religious consciousness or God consciousness, then we are as good as cats and dogs. That is the only difference. You go anywhere, any part of the world, and civilized human beings, they have got a system, which you may call religion or philosophy, to understand God. That prerogative is especially for the human beings. But if you do not care for that special prerogative, then you are as good as animal. What is the difference between animal and human being unless he has got some method of understanding God? The animal eats and we also eat. The animals sleep; we also sleep. The animals have sexual intercourse; we have got also. They are also afraid of something; we are also afraid of something. Then what is the difference?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> They cannot understand God(?).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference. A human being can understand what is God, what is my relationship with God, what is my duty in that relationship, what is my aim of life, where I shall go after death, wherefrom I have come. These questions must be there in human form of life; otherwise we are still in the animal kingdom.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Do the animals have no consciousness of God?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Do the animals have no consciousness of God?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have no God consciousness. They do not know what is God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Somehow I always thought that...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like children, they do not know what is government. They are satisfied with their eating, sleeping, playing, that's all. They have no other concern. But when one is grown up, he knows what is government. He has to abide by the state laws. Now you are grown up, if you violate the law "Keep to the right,'' you'll be criminal. But a child, if he violates the law, animal violates the law, he has no... But if a adult person violates the law, he'll be criminal. You cannot say, "I'm free.'' No. Law will not excuse. But if a children commits something... Suppose you, if you take something from my table, it is for you criminal. But if a child takes something from my table, it is not criminal. In your country especially, if you enter my house or room without permission, that is criminal. Is it not? Trespass.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But a child or dog enters, that is not trespassing. A child or dog or cat, they enter without any permission. Therefore this animal kingdom and the human being, there is difference. By the evolutionary process we come to the human form of life. When we were animals... We were animals also. We are passing through 8,400,000 forms of life-from aquatic to plants, trees, then insect, then flies, then birds, then beasts, then uncivilized human beings, jungle, then come to this Aryan form, civilized form of human being. So it is obtained after many, many transmigrations. And if we do not understand the responsibility... Just like in an establishment one man is promoted. His first charge is doorkeeper, then he is gradually he is given promotion; he may come to the post of the manager. Just like in bank, it so happens. They must go through all the different stages of service. So when he becomes manager, if he does not know the responsibility, again he comes to the lowest position. Again he has to strive for the top. So if we forget our responsibility and become like cats and dogs, then we are going back again to take the forms of cats and dogs. This is a great science. Nobody is very serious to understand this science, but the science is there. We are, our Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is to educate people about this science. They're neglecting this science. That means they are violating the prerogative of the chance, the facility of human being. After all, you have to die; you cannot check it. But if you die like the cats and dogs, then our life is spoiled, and if you die like a human being, then our life is perfect. Everyone will die, but one who dies like a human being for understanding what is God, what is my relationship with Him, and acting in relationship with God, then our life is perfect. So you like this philosophy or not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Somehow I always thought that people should be more like animals, because animals only, ah, only take what they need...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why don't you become like animal?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why you are dressing yourself? Why don't you wander like animal, naked?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> No. But animals still have their own communities, and they only take what they need to eat, and they only eat when they need to eat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now the philosophy is how to become animals? This is the philosophy nowadays?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Today's people sometimes, Prabhupāda, she's thinking, are worse than animal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. If their philosophy is to become animal then they must be worse than animal, because actually they are not animal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> (laughs) That's what I mean.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> That's right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the ultimate goal is to become animal, so that is artificial. So a human being desiring to become animal must be worse than animal, because animal has got some...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Has got some...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...routine work.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Because ah...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like cats and dogs. They have sexual desire in certain period of the year. But a man, although he is trying to be animal, but he has no restriction. He has sexual desire anytime. Therefore he is worse than animal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> Man eats and kills everything.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The animals kill just their own quota.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So therefore, if a man wants to become animal, he becomes worse than animal. A tiger, a tiger eats meat and he has got equipments in his body, what is called, nails, teeth, immediately pounce upon any animal and kills and eats. But a man cannot do that, but his teeth is different, he has no nails; therefore he has to kill animal in different way, by slaughterhouse. So he is worse than animal. You kill one animal for your eating purpose, that is one thing, but if you keep slaughterhouse for business, then you are more (indistinct). Therefore for a human being to try to become animal is worse than the animals, because... Just like you are now grown up. If you imitate that "I want to become child, so I enter anyone's house,'' the law will not allow you. And if you say that "My philosophy is to become a child; therefore I enter this man's house,'' the law will say, "All right, first of all you'll be punished.'' (laughter) You cannot say that. Because you are grown up you cannot act as a child. Similarly, because you are human being, if you act as an animal you'll be responsible for your acts. And you'll be punished if you do something wrong. You cannot say, "No, I have made my philosophy to become a child.'' That may be your personal philosophy, but law will not allow you. Ignorance is no excuse. (long pause) It has become a philosophy now to become like animals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> They say "Back to nature."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Back to nature'' means first of all your nature is different from other's nature. An animal can lie down anywhere on the street. Can you do that? So how can man go back to nature like that? A dog lying down on the street... Here, of course, every dog has got a master. In India there are many dogs, they haven't got master, so they are eating anywhere or lying. But you cannot do so. If you lie down on the street at night, perhaps you'll be arrested. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Neither you can do so. You must have an apartment. Maybe less costly apartment, but because you are a human being you must have an apartment. So how you can go to the nature? Even the <i class="calibre3">ṛṣis</i> used to live in the jungle, they had a cottage, not like animals. They had hermitage cottage to live. Just like Rūpa Goswāmī's picture. You have seen?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So they left their luxuriant residence as ministers. But when they went to Vṛndāvana, they had a cottage.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I think the impulse is more or less a reaction to their alienation for material life. They feel so alienated from artificial material life that they think maybe, that simply more..., they think animalistic would be more desirable.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> The inclination may be right, but the spiritual education is lacking. They don't have the teacher.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Education.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the defect of modern education.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Well, they go to college, and so this is where the idea started. It got bigger and bigger and bigger, and now it's out of control. (laughs) It's terrible. It's all-pervasive. (indistinct) I don't kill animals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Vegetarian?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Now, yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He's vegetarian.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well vegetarians are not animals. (laughter) In India, you'll still you'll find ninety-percent of the population, they're vegetarians, strictly. Always vegetarians. They're quite healthy, they're working. Therefore vegetarians are human beings. Vegetables, that food is meant for human beings. That is natural. For a human being to become nonvegetarian is unnatural. And to become vegetarian, that is natural. Just like our teeth, it is meant for cutting vegetables, fruit, not meat. You will find cutting by these teeth, meat, it will be difficult. But you take any vegetable, any fruit, you can immediately cut. Our medical laws says that anything eatable which you cannot cut with the teeth and smash it properly, it will not be digested. So fruits and vegetables you can properly cut even raw, not to speak of cooked. Raw vegetables and raw fruits, you can cut with these teeth and smash it and you swallow, it will be nicely digested. You get all food value. But you cannot do in that way, raw meat. It is not possible. You cannot take raw meat or bite one animal and take some flesh out of it. You cannot. But animal can do that. They are made for that purpose. But that is natural. If you take your natural food, if you live naturally, if you fulfill your natural desires, then it is natural. And as soon as you go against these things, that is unnatural. So if you give up your natural tendency as human being and take artificially the way of life of an animal, that is not natural. In human society the..., however uncivilized human being, there is the process of covering this private part. Even in jungle they cover with the bark of tree. Why? That is the human being. But an animal in the jungle, they do not care. They can go, the same jungle-I don't speak of the city life-even in jungle life, the aborigines, still they have got some cover. Now they are becoming naked, natural life, nudism. Huh? That John Lennon, there is a picture in his sitting room, standing naked. This is madness. That is not natural life. If you go against your natural life, that is madness. Just like a madman walks on the street naked. So these are... So our mission is to advise everyone, educate everyone to become exactly like human being. That you can become by understanding God. The books, educational institutions, are meant for human being, for knowledge. All the books all over the world, they are not meant for cats and dogs. They are meant for human beings. The schools, colleges and universities, institutions, they are meant for human being, not for the cats and dogs. So we must take advantage of these books, institution, knowledge, teachers. That is real human life. Just like your guitar.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Guitar, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is for human being, art, not for the cats and dogs. So how you can go to animal life? That is not possible. [break] How do you know your father?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Well, I met him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I met him. I grew up with him. (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How do you know your real father?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How do you know he's your father, who you met?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> They just told me.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Who told you?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> (laughs) My father.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Somebody told you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The mother told you, or somebody told you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And you accepted it. Similarly, about God you have to take information from somebody who is authorized to tell you about God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Yeah.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is known, can be known, from authorized source of knowledge. A child does not know what is this. He asks father, "Father, what is this?'' The father explains, "My dear boy, this is dictaphone. When I speak, it records.'' Childlike, you see? That is the way of knowledge. If you do not know God, you must approach a person who knows God. There is knowledge. There is no difficulty.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> But I went to church, and I still don't know.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Ātreya Ṛṣi:</span> He went to church and he could not find out.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I couldn't feel it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That may be, but you may be cheated, that is another thing. Suppose you ask something from somebody. If he cheats you, that may be your mistake or his, but the process is the same; you cannot avoid it. If you want to know God, then you have to go to a person who knows God. You might have gone to a person who does not know. That is another thing. You went to a wrong person. But actually if you want to know God, you must have to go to a person who knows God. That you have to search out. That requires intelligence. But you cannot give up the idea. Because you have been cheated, "I could not get information"; therefore, you cannot give up that business. You have to find out somebody else. But because you say "I have been cheated. I could not get the right information. I stop this business,'' that is not allowed. You must. Therefore, according to Vedic order it is said, <i class="calibre3">tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet<span class="Italic"></span></i> <span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]. <i class="calibre3">Abhigacchet</i> means you must to a person to understand that science of God. You must go to a guru or a man who knows. Guru means who is more intelligent. Guru means weight, heavy, heavier, heavier in knowledge. So you have to find out a person who is heavier than you, not ordinary. Must go. Not that may go or may not go. No. Must go. <i class="calibre3">Tad vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum eva abhigacchet<span class="Italic"></span></i> <span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]. And what is the symptom of guru? <i class="calibre3">Śrotriyaṁ</i>. Means he has heard about God from his superior, his guru. <i class="calibre3">Śrotriyaṁ</i>. And how can I know that he has heard from his superior about God? He might say that "Yes, I have heard,'' but what symptoms? <i class="calibre3">Brahma-niṣṭham</i>. <i class="calibre3">Brahma-niṣṭham</i> means that he has become a complete devotee of God, result. Just like a man, physician. A physician means he has attended the medical college, passed the examination, and the result is that he's practicing as a physician. Not only passing will do, but he's actually passing and he's actually practicing and he's curing patients. Therefore, you find out a physician, here is a physician. It is not difficult. So guru means one who knows God. How can I know that he knows God? Because he's making others to know God. Where is the difficulty? But if you go to a person who does not know God, that is your fault. If you go to a physician who is not actually physician, a storekeeper, then that is your fault. You must have the intelligence who is a physician. That much intelligence you have got. You see a signboard, Dr. such and such M.D., medical practicer. Now you go there and you see there are patients waiting for him, for his treatment, he's giving medicine and they are being cured. Then what is the difficulty to find out a physician? There is no difficulty. So if one is serious to be cured of the disease he must go to a physician. If he does not go to the physician, how he can be cured? Just like you have learned this guitar playing. Do you learn it alone or learn it from somebody?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Mainly by myself.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Mainly alone.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you have followed somebody at least, standard.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Oh, yeah, people I heard.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So that is the way of learning what is God. The main business is that one must know God. It is not that because I approach some person and he did not know, he could give me the right knowledge of God, then I give up this idea of knowing God. No. That will not..., that is not good for human life. Then you remain animal. I might have been cheated or I might not have approached the proper person, but that does not mean that I can stop that idea. That is not... In another place it is said, <i class="calibre3">tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam<span class="Italic"></span></i> [SB 11.3.21]. One who is actually inquisitive to understand the highest benefit of life, he must approach a guru. <i class="calibre3">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ</i>. <i class="calibre3">Jijñāsu</i> means inquisitive. <i class="calibre3">Śreya-</i>the highest benefit of life. <i class="calibre3">Uttamam-</i>highest. <i class="calibre3">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsuḥ śreya uttamam</i>. <i class="calibre3">Ṣābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ</i>. What is the qualification of such a person? <i class="calibre3">Ṣābde pare ca niṣṇātaṁ</i>. He is completely well versed in the transcendental science. And what is the symptom that he is well versed? <i class="calibre3">Brahmaṇy upaśamāśrayam</i>. He has taken shelter of Brahma or Kṛṣṇa or God. <i class="calibre3">Upāsanā-</i>finishing all desires. These two things: he is a devotee and he has no more material desires. He must be well versed in the science, he must be a devotee, and he has no attraction for material things. These three things, if you can find, then he's perfect guru. Everything is there in the <i class="calibre3">śāstra</i>; therefore books should be consulted. If you have no books, those who are discussing books, you should approach them, you should hear them. Just like we are holding class, morning, evening. People can come here, take advantage what we are speaking, then gradually they can understand. But we cannot avoid that. That is not good idea. If I say that "I went to church. I'm not very much enlightened; therefore I give up this attempt,'' oh, that is not good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Oh, I didn't give it up. I'm still looking.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He comes to <i class="calibre3">aratik.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> He takes <i class="calibre3">prasādam.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice, very good. You also come?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> I just got here a little while ago.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> I just got here a few days ago, but I've been twice. We'll be here Friday or Saturday or so. I chanted on the street.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You chanted?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <i class="calibre3">Saṅkīrtana</i> party.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> We want get some cymbals, cymbals.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> Cymbals. We sang Hare Kṛṣṇa on the airplane.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You're chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa on the airplane?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Yeah, it was fun.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can chant anywhere. There is no restriction. There is no special rules and regulations. You can chant anywhere. Whenever you find it convenient, you can chant.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> We were singing Hare Kṛṣṇa, so...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. Go on singing. (laughter) Yes. Go on singing and everything will be revealed within yourself, it's so nice.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> It's a comforting feeling.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Marilyn:</span> It's a comforting feeling just from the whole repetition.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So go on chanting, then everything will be all right.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Can we get some cymbals?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whenever you find opportunity, you come and join with us.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> Can we get some cymbals?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">John Fahey:</span> I don't know where to get them.</div>
