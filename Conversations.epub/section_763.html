<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They say there are many old temples which need renovation, so they will spend the money for the renovation of old temples but not construct new temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they don't want expansion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what kind of committee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> But that also is a farce, because they spent thirteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees for construction of a temple in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So New York, we have got so many temples. Let them here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They know. Anna(?) Rao, who is chairman.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...temples (indistinct) foreign countries, then let them (indistinct) We shall.... How?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They are very political. They want to take charge of everything that they give money for.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They want to take charge of everything that they give money for. Just like these temples which they have in New York, they will be in charge of them. They are the <span class="Italic">pūjārīs</span> and things...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means they are constructing their own temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That will be a Gaṇeśa temple.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why Gaṇeśa temple?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Gaṇeśa and other deities also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We know the people in charge of it. We went there for a program.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means all these foolish ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Actually, Prabhupāda, it is only for.... They say it will ultimately be for the Hindu community there, for performing their marriages...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So who, Hindu, will go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, I have been to this Gaṇeśa temple. We went there for a program once. It's such a small piece of land in Queens. No one's going to go there. When we were there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's in Queens?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> (laughs) In Flushing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...we distributed about twenty of your big books in half an hour there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In New York?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In that Gaṇeśa temple. I've gone there with Yadubara and Viśākhā once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They already built it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, they have a temporary one, but they're building a.... They've been building it for five years. They just have a layout of all...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their cult, this Tirupati committee?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Hinduism. Hinduism. Very.... No definition of that term now, Hinduism. Just like if we want to get on the radio, they'll say, "Well, there are so many minor sects. So if we give time for one, then everybody will want." But then, when we want some other aid, they say, "No, you're a majority group. We have to help the minority groups." So sometimes we are a minor sect and sometimes we are a majority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) All fools, rascals, <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> [break] The Tirupati is a Vaiṣṇava temple, so they should encourage.... Vaisnavism means real religion. All other, bogus, cheating religions. That is.... <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo atra [SB 1.1.2]. Kaitava</span> means cheating. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know that. What is this land?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> The police superintendent's house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Police superintendent. They are using the Deity's money, Prabhupāda, to maintain the universities. And in the universities they are teaching birth control and so many other things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why don't you take them into court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Take them to court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> It's like fighting against the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are the court means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I mean to say, the same persons are the court. They're all one clique.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The court has legalized abortion, for example, now.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In India?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. In America. In India also the government's encouraging.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In India it's encouraged. They get a reward.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The government pays.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Yaśodānandana:</span> They give a radio.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They'll give you a prize, and the person who brings someone, he will get twenty-five rupees. And the doctor, after a month he gets a bonus.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Now the government is thinking of having a policy by which if a person has more than two children he will not be promoted, he will not get raises-to discourage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Mohammedan community has refused, and Christian. So they feel...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not Hindus?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Hindus are doing. So they feel in a few generations the Mohammedan, Christian community will outnumber the Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is that their plan?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. Even to the point that Purī Śaṅkarācārya printed a book how everyone should have five children; all Hindus should have as many children as they want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...authorities, do they believe in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes. Every day there you'll find <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why they are going against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> That I don't know. Every day they are preaching...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ask them that "What is the meaning of your reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> daily if you go against it?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But they are not going, but the preachers who comes there, they are doing it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What they are doing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They bring in preachers to preach <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but they themselves, they don't read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So preachers means third-class preachers. Anybody is allowed to speak, any nonsense? That is going on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> How they are going against it, Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? You do not know how they are going against?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm not familiar with this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you say, "I read <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I'm not familiar with Tirupati's practice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Tirupati is establishing Gaṇeśa temple. That is against <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Bhagavān says that <span class="Italic">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānā yajanty anya-devatāḥ [Bg. </span>7.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> The rascals who are very much lusty, lost their intelligence, they worship other demigods.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> have had all their authority taken away from them by these...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> All their authority in the temples has been taken away by the government committee.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Just ritualistically in the morning the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> comes and opens the door. He holds the key. We met him at Rangaji.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Rāmānujācārya <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they have no influence over them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> [break] ...to me that the actual purpose of this Tirupati government committee is eventually to do away with all religious function.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's their real plan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> How to take the money that's being donated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This is the beginning. They are making a show now, but eventually the plan will be to close all the temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Nationalize all temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Not close, 'cause you can make a lot of money. It's easier than enacting taxes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Just like banks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but when they don't become profitable then they'll close it. That's the point. Milk 'em dry. Instead of the state or the government being the servant of the Deity, they are making the Deity the servant of the government.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Money-earning servant.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. The tax collector.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Just like they nationalize industries, they want to nationalize the temple, Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In Andhra Pradesh all the temples are nationalized?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, all temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What about ours?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Well, they're not so strong in the other states. Andhra Pradesh and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they'll copy it. I think they're starting in U.P. now. I read in the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Anywhere that there are big temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> U.P. has a lot of temples.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what about our temples?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, they will gradually try.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you make this American property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Make it American property.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> How about English?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our society is registered in America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In India presently we are registered in Bombay and all the other centers are branch offices. That's why in Hyderabad they haven't touched us. In Maharastra.... I think Maharastra will be the last state to do something of this type.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But then when it does it, what will you do?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We'll try our best to escape it, but if there's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We should try to make some provision now if possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> If the government wants to do that, you can't do anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we are changing.... We are making our constitution look like a welfare society, so this way we may not fall under this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> We have to preach to them so that they understand the value of this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Europeans, they are coming here not for religion, but they are coming for the Kṛṣṇa culture. You have to make that. Religion they have already got, Christian. Why they should come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> They will say that this Kṛṣṇa culture is Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he's a rascal. Prove it in the court. Kṛṣṇa is not Hinduism. Never.... Is there anything in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that Kṛṣṇa says, "I am for the Hindus or for the Indians"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Hindu law is so elastic, anyone who calls himself a Hindu or who practices any branch...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Or puts on <span class="Italic">tilaka.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Puts on <span class="Italic">tilaka,</span> he may have the lowest character or the highest standard, anyone, he will be all considered a Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this should be taken to court, on the Supreme Court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But if there is no definition of Hindu, how can you prove...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no Hindu. It is not.... Therefore we are not Hindu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, they'll say, "This is our definition. This is what we say a Hindu is."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The court says, "This is what we say a Hindu is. So you're Hindus."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. And court can say anything, but then why not put it into the judgment of many judges?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then we have to establish what is Hinduism...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...and what is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> It is already established.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can define anything. That does not mean that your definition is perfect. Actually we have to.... Who...? Suppose Hindu. So who is not accepting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>? But where is...? In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> where is the mention of "Hindu"? Hm? Kṛṣṇa says that "I am the father of all living entities." So why do they say that this is Hindusim?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> "Well, all religions say that they are the best. Jesus Christ says, 'Everyone who comes to me, they will get the grace of God.' So the same thing. But still they are Christians and you are Hindus."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this cannot stay in the court. Kṛṣṇa's instruction is not for the Hindus. Nowhere it is mentioned.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The word "Hindu" doesn't appear in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> anywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then why do you use in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness the Hindu caste marks, Hindus caste marks and <span class="Italic">tilakas</span>? This is all Hinduism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is not Hinduism. Appears like Hindu. Just like you appear like an Indian <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> but you are not Indian.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The judge is wearing a white wig and a British suit. He's not British either.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we are clearly stating Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes, but Kṛṣṇa is a Hindu god.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your definition. Kṛṣṇa doesn't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But my definition counts 'cause I'm in charge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can do any nonsense. That is.... Therefore you have to be taken to the court, that "How you can..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they are the court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "...talk like nonsense and do like nonsense? Then anyone can do any nonsense thing? Then who will control you?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's the point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> The chief justice himself was saying like that in Madras. Their opinion will come in their favor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, they can give opinion, but there is supreme court. There is international court. We shall go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> International court?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's only for disputes between countries, international court.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is country-"We are American. They are forcing us to become a Hindu." This is between country. You have to tackle with intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> It's become a world issue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In most books about Hinduism they describe that Hinduism is a cult where they worship many gods and ultimately God is formless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> So we are against that. Then we are not Hindus even philosophically according to that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are against all so-called cheating religion. The Hinduism is also a cheating religion. We are preaching <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> beginning that "We have kicked out all cheating religion." What is cheating religion? That one has to understand. And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇitam: [SB </span>6.3.19] "Religion means the order given by God." If you do not know who is God, "imperson," then where is your religion? We have to tackle things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They will consult all the standard dictionaries about Kṛṣṇa's definition and all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dictionary is not the standard. The standard is the book itself. That is our preaching. You may bring some dictionary made by some fools. No. We have to take reference. Therefore we are presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, even Jesus Christ just said, "I am for all," but there is Christianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is a fact. Either God or God's representative, He is for everyone. <span class="Italic">Suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is the definition of <span class="Italic">sādhu. Titikṣavaḥ karunikaḥ suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānām</span> [SB 3.25.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> A saintly person..., as God is for everyone, a saintly person is for everyone. Why he should be for Hindu or Muslim or Christian? That is the definition of saintly person. <span class="Italic">Suhrdaḥ. Suhṛdaḥ</span> means well-wisher. So either Christ or any Vaiṣṇava, he is well-wisher for everyone. [break] ...<span class="Italic">suhṛdaḥ sarva-bhūtānām.</span> We are preaching all over the world and they are appreciating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So many others have preached Hinduism but have no result.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No result. Why they should become Hindu?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That sign is there, "Swami Vivekananda, the Hindu monk."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But who cares for Rāmakrishna Mission? Hindu monk, but who cares for the Rāmakrishna Mission? For the last eighty-five years they are working. How many Hindus they have made? Simply bogus propaganda. They advertise that "We have made all Americans..." But where the Americans? They picked up two American ladies, that's all. Where is the Hindu <span class="Italic">sādhus</span> eating meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Here it says, <span class="Italic">"Hare Kṛṣṇa Babu nagar."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Who is Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">Babu</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It says <span class="Italic">"Hare Kṛṣṇa nagar atar(?)"</span> in the front also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who is that? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> That is Hare Kṛṣṇa land. This is Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">Babu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Babu? Babu</span> means?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Foreign devotees, they are joining this movement not because it is a Hindu culture. They take it as a real spiritual culture. Otherwise why, for the last hundred, two hundred years, the Hindu <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> yogis, were going there? Who did accept it? Did anybody? The Rāmakrishna Mission, Hindu monk, within the eighty-five years, how many Hindus they have made? You can count maybe a dozen only. Huh? Did they make any Hindus, European, American young boys? And it is the Hindu custom that <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> eat meat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Drink wine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And have women.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...drinking wine and eating meat, the next stage is illicit sex. Is that the business of the Hindu monk? There are <span class="Italic">sampradāyas,</span> Rāmānuja <span class="Italic">sampradāya,</span> Śaṅkara <span class="Italic">sampradāya.</span> But where the Hindu monk drinks and eats meat? They have introduced it. Is that Hinduism?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> [break] Satajit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nowadays everyone has become impersonal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...pure Vaiṣṇava. What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> House of a life member.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. [break] ...take to our principles, these things will be automatically be finished. <span class="Italic">Na ca daivāt paraṁ balam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vasughosa:</span> [break] In Indonesia the government has a Hindu-Buddha department.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vasughoṣa:</span> Hinduism department in Indonesia. So they've divided the land..., you know, the different religions into different departments, and they have one man who studied in Benares. He's in charge of the whole country for Hinduism and Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why they do not allow our?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vasughosa:</span> No, actually they allow us. They allow our society, but it's such a corrupt country that at any moment they could kick us out if they want. They have no principle except money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Africa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vasughosa:</span> Yes. But the man seems to be a little intelligent, a little knowledgeable. I met him. He seems to be a little.... [break] They try to renovate temples there. They are very old temples like in India and they have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...they do not give for so-called religion, it is better. They are not spoiling the money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The head of that Viśva-Hindu went to Delhi to get tax exemption. So they said, "You drop the name Hindu." They said, "No, we will never drop the name Hindu. Even if you don't give us tax exemption, we will be without the tax exempt but we will never give up our name Hindu."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Whatever whimsically you make your law, that is law. Actually they are not fighting. Hindu law means <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> So who is pressing them that "We don't require any law except this"? And where is that Hindu, strong Hindu? Hindu means <span class="Italic">Manu-saṁhitā.</span> [break] ...<span class="Italic">mānave prāhur.</span> This Manu. Original instruction is coming from Manu. [break] ...the word <span class="Italic">Manu,</span> the word <span class="Italic">mānava</span> has come. Just like he has started that <span class="Italic">mānava-dharma. Mānava-dharma</span> means Manu. That he does not know. From Manu, <span class="Italic">mānava</span> has come, just like from <span class="Italic">sādhu, sādhava</span> has come. They do not know even grammar. These leaders, they do not know even grammar. [break] ...chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> If the government is giving them free homes and we're giving them free <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> why should they work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They should work for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there is one economist. I think you've quoted him, John Kenneth Galbraith. He says that if there's no.... If somebody is supplied with a place to sleep and something to eat, why should he work? That he won't work unless there is some motivation. If he's forced to work, he will work. Otherwise he won't work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Your preaching is not meant for creating a lazy class of men. You have to engage them in Kṛṣṇa consciousness business. That is preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mahāṁsa:</span> Then you feed them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and then give him <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> He will be automatically purified, and offer himself for service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So they have to chant first.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Then they will say, "Well, you are proselytizing by rice."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not proselytizing. I am bringing him...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Unless they take to your religion...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Unless they follow you, then you won't feed them. You are starving them until they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. We shall go on. Chanting will also go on. Both things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> That was the article of the CARE, I think. They will give food, but you cannot use it to proselytize.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, we give <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam,</span> not food.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Like in Guntur, in a Christian hospital, in the maternity ward they would not release the baby to the parents until they converted to Christianity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> In Guntur. So they did it to one <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family, and he brought it to the court because he was more orthodox, and they were.... Only one or two articles came in the newspaper. It was hushed up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It takes ten years for the court to decide.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Well, immediately the police ordered that it had to be released. Or they put.... Just like the Mohammedan water, they put some bread in a well in a place like this, and then they can say, "You are all Christian now because you have drunk the bread that we have put there."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are doing like that here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Yes. In Europe, when Christianity first came to Constantine, the priests would stay in the top of a river, and they marched an army through the river, and the priest put the holy water, and when the army came on the other side they said, "Now you've all been baptized. You're all Christians." Mass conversion. [break] ...Hindu groups are mixing Hinduism and Indian nationality, it's fascism. That was also the government's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> Fascism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> The Hindu groups. That was the point that enraged the government. The same <span class="Italic">paṇḍitas</span> with the <span class="Italic">prāyaścitta,</span> they don't like the Mohammedans, they don't like the Christians. They say, "You have created Pakistan, so all the Mohammedans should go there. This is Hindustan."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Murvi(?)</span> meat here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Not everyone did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mostly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Mostly. Nowadays it is a fashion to eat when the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> take in a house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Taking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, they take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes, most of them. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">sambhava.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>? All <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But according to.... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...not vegetarian. We are neither nonvegetarian. We eat <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-prasādam.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "Give me this food." <span class="Italic">Patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we offer Him, and then we eat it, so we have nothing to do with vegetarian and nonvegetarian. If Kṛṣṇa says that, "You give Me flesh," then we can eat flesh also. But Kṛṣṇa does not say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? I have heard one person say that <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ</span> doesn't include other things. There are many other things that we offer Kṛṣṇa besides <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So similarly, why can't we offer meat? He doesn't say, "Don't offer me meat."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it doesn't say you can't offer Kṛṣṇa meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you like, you can do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't want to.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) What directly He says, you have to take. And if you interpret, that can be interpreted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Acyutānanda:</span> They have rewritten the Bible, "Thou shalt not murder."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...can be used as paper weight. (laughter) [break] ...use anything for Kṛṣṇa.</div>
