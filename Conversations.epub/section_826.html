<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...gave one flower to the prime minister of Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He gave her a donation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> How much did he give?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I don't know how much he gave, but he gave a donation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Did he get a book?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes, she gave him our magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> There was no security.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> There was no security around him. He just was standing there on the sidewalk out in front of one hotel after this luncheon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> And she just walked up to him and "Oh, this is a flower for you," pinned it on his lapel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. So he has no personal guard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> He had some guard, but it was not very strict security, there was no... It's not like in America, where the president is very..., his life is very jeopardized all the time. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is not their fault. The Western civilization is like that. Now you have to make a thorough change. The persons from the ecclesiastical order, they are also so polluted, they are sanctioning homosex, abortion. What can be done for the common man?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> I was reading in the paper the other day, how the Catholic church has drastically declined in the last ten years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They must decline.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They are losing one billion dollars a year in donations because they cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have to starve, not a single paisa donation. By law should be prohibited. No donation should be (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> They used to be very strong. Everybody had to give ten percent of their wages.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We can see just..., in our society that we have bought so many Catholic properties...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...already. For our temples. In Toronto, I think, we bought a Catholic church, and Montreal and Australia also, that was Catholic property. They are selling all their property off because they cannot afford to maintain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Still in South America the people are Catholic and pious...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (indistinct) we wanted to purchase a convent...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How dilapidated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> How envious they were. We wanted to purchase the convent, and they said they would sell us only if they could tear down the church. They wouldn't sell it to us unless they could tear down the church.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Passers-by:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It would have been a big defeat if they had sold us that church and we moved in.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> (indistinct) ...United States, they have taken eight million Catholics in Philadelphia. Just before the time of our Rathayātrā I think...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> When they took Rādhā-Dāmodara down to Mexico, all the Catholics thought it was Virgin Mary and Jesus, and they all came to offer their obeisances. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which way I shall go? This way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> This way, Śrīla Prabhupāda. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Last time there was a big crowd to hear you, Prabhupāda-the Christians.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> And you mentioned they were clapping for a long, long time after hearing you speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not long, long time, but... Madhudviṣa, you remember that Catholic...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes, they asked you about St. Francis, about him chanting to the dogs and the trees and the birds. And you said, "That is actually God-realization. <span class="Italic">Samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu.</span>"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And when they asked about Christ, and "He's our guru."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> You started your main lecture off there, "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name." And then you went on to explain about the holy name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm, (indistinct) are here. Why is it? Some wood. [break] ...grow foodgrains, simple living.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> The house is there, under the trees.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (aside:) You have got this card.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> In the Western countries they would call this primitive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know what is civilization, that is there. The difficulty is they have no education about human civilization. <span class="Italic">Bahir-artha-māninā.</span> They are simply captivated by the external energy, bodily conception of life. They do not know what is the aim of life. This is Western civilization. <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This is not Western, this is the demonic civilization. They do not know what is the aim of life. Our..., the material atmosphere, they're not happy, they're failing always, missing the real point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The people that live in the cities think that the farmers work so hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And these rascals rise early in the morning and start their car to go to the office, five hours coming and going, and eight hours working there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Again in the evening they have to drive back. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...I saw that these big men, they were taking so many pep pills during the day to do their work, and in the evening they had to take tranquilizers to go to sleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I have seen so, so many advertisements. One has to take at least five to six types of.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> No peace of mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> In this way the Kali-yuga will progress, and they'll eat less and less food and take more pills, and they will think it is advancement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Housewives think like that already. They take some pills, and they become very slim and they don't have to eat so much. They just smoke cigarettes and drink coffee and take pills. And they're saving money, they think. They don't have to buy so much food, and they're able to remain slim and trim. So in Kali-yuga, as the food supply runs out, so people won't notice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> says they will be starving.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> As Kali-yuga advances, they're mentioning one time, there will be <span class="Italic">durbhikṣā,</span> means not even <span class="Italic">bhikṣā</span> will be given to <span class="Italic">sādhus.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, not even <span class="Italic">bhikṣā</span> will be available. I don't think <span class="Italic">bhikṣā</span> is available in Western countries, eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhikṣā?</span> Meaning begging for food? No, they will arrest you. (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Arrest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Yes, begging is against the law. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> ...alms is very elevated. In Western countries, it is a crime. It's written, "Begging alms." That's one crime that they charge the devotees on sometimes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Electricity is coming?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Yes, these poles are meant for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I doubt, though, if these people can afford.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The government can. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...go to beg rice or something, like we were doing for a food program, all the people slam the door in your face. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> ...went to America, what was your idea of what would be your program when you got there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This idea: I shall speak to don't eat meat, and they'll immediately kick me out. (laughter) That was my program. And I was going to say that "Don't eat meat. No illicit sex," and immediately they will kick me out. "All right." I never thought that you would accept it. That is the idea of my poetry. That is sung, no? You have got that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And I was asking Kṛṣṇa, "I do not know why You have brought me here. As soon as I will say these things, they will kick me out. What is Your program, I do not know." (chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Akṣayānanda:</span> Everybody knows in their heart that actually these things are wrong.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You are so expert. For one year you did not mention those rules and regulations, I heard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, I simply said, "Come and join and chant."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> And when they developed higher taste, then you said, "Now no more meat-eating." [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...simply man looks after the animals, that he's strong and happy, they'll get food grains, the cooperation, and both of them happy. But they're not looking to that. They are trying to sell the grains and get more money, and purchase wine and enjoy. And when the animal will be unable to work, sell him to the slaughterhouse and get money. And for these sinful activities, they are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Their idea is just to exploit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah, yes. Everyone is trying to get more, and nature's order is that you take only to maintain your body and soul together. That's all. If you take more, then you are thief, you'll be punished by the laws of nature. This is going on. Laws of nature are so fine that by material activities you'll never be satisfied, and at the time of death, he'll lament that "I could not satisfy my desires. Let me take..." "All right, take another body. Satisfy." This is nature's punishment. <span class="Italic">Karmaṇā daiva netreṇa jantur dehopapattaye [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> Simple things. We desire, and nature will give you another body. <span class="Italic">māyā-yantrārūḍhāni.</span> He'll give you, "Ride on this car, you wanted, on this body." And this... This is creation of <span class="Italic">māyā. Īśvaraḥ sarva-bhūtānāṁ hṛd-deśe... [Bg. 18.61].</span> Kṛṣṇa is there, orders <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> "He wants to enjoy life. Give him this body." "Come on, here is a hog's body, eat nicely, stool. Come on." He did not like to eat <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> He wanted something rubbish. "All right, come here. Take this stool." These things are going automatically. The same way, as you infect some disease, immediately the disease is there. You haven't got to manufacture diseases. Because you have infected yourself with the disease germ, "Take this disease." Therefore it is warned, <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">,</span> "Don't desire anything except Kṛṣṇa's service." Then you are immune. Otherwise you have to take birth. The Māyāvādī philosophers, they take the Absolute Truth void, so they have no good desires, again they come to material desires.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They want to be desireless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If the Māyāvādīs don't believe in the difference between the soul and the Supersoul, then how can they... What is their explanation of reincarnation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They say that this is not incarnation, it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Just like the sky is covered in a pot, and as soon as the pot breaks, the sky mixes with the big sky. That's all. That is their theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So therefore they say God is covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not God. You are covered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> But you are God, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you are God, but you are covered by this body. So as soon as the body is finished, you mix with. Just like you take one pot and you take water. The water is there, but if you break this pot, the water comes and mixes with.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Then what is their reason for not becoming the biggest rascal? Why not become the biggest rascal? The pot's going to break anyway. What difference does it make? Why not become a big rascal and enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Because the Māyāvādīs, they also perform some austerity and <span class="Italic">tapasya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to break the pot. That is their (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But what is the breaking of the pot?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> The pot doesn't refer to the body but the illusion. They want to get rid of not the body but the illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, illusion in this sense, that I am covered by the pot, it will break or I shall break, and when it is broken then there is no more pot. I become one with the sky.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So why should you endeavor for it? It's going to happen anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> To break it as soon as possible. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> That doesn't make any sense. "Crackpot philosophy."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> If there's no individuality, I can't understand how can there be any desire for...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is individuality, but these people do not understand it, because... In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, acchedyam.</span> It is not that part is taken. The <span class="Italic">accedya.</span> Because spirit cannot be cut into pieces, and while it is in piece, either you take it in part or something else, that is eternal. It is not that by the <span class="Italic">māyā</span> we have become piece. Yes. That is not <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> It is piece. All right, <span class="Italic">sanātana, mamaivāṁśo jīva-bhūtaḥ sanātanaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">,</span> eternally that piece.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They did not take that to mean the constitutional position of the living entity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, they do not know. Therefore they are less intelligent. They are individual, but artificially they are thinking, "I shall become one."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> may argue that to become desireless is against the natural order. Because we see that right from the beginning of our life we're desiring so many things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Desireless. When he will desire less, you convince. They're always desiring.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then where is desireless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But we're saying <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy anāvṛtam [</span><i class="calibre3">Brs.<span class="calibre3"></span></i> 1.1.11]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Anya, anya</span> means <span class="Italic">anyathā.</span> You are servant, you should always desire how to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is your natural. And if you don't want to serve, that is <span class="Italic">anyathā. Anyābhilāṣa.</span> That is <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣa. Anya</span> means other, <span class="Italic">abhilāṣa </span>means desire. So everyone has got desire, but that desire should be natural, according to position. But if you desire something else, nonsense, then you suffer. That... Caitanya Mahāprabhu said <span class="Italic">jīvera svarūpa haya nitya-kṛṣṇa-dāsa</span> [Cc. Madhya 20.108-109]<span class="Italic">.</span> You are eternal servant of Kṛṣṇa, so you desire only how to serve Him. Why you are desiring otherwise? They will suffer. We are desiring, "I shall become God," "I shall become one with God," "I shall become this, I shall become..." So many hundreds and thousands. So that you have to stop. Because you are servant, you should desire how to serve Kṛṣṇa. That is your natural... Eh? Just like in your country the women, they are thinking of equal rights. Eh? And how you can equal rights? You have to become pregnant. So you become pregnant and take care of the child; that is your duty. In India still, you'll find they are happy. And now they are, "No, we shall be equal with the men." And how you'll stop your pregnancy? And that they do not think. So they're thinking that "We shall not be pregnant, and if we become pregnant we shall kill, and we shall have equal rights with the men." This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They say they may become pregnant and have children, but the men should take care of the children, equally.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why? Why you should take? You are meant for taking... The child does not go to the father for being taken care. It goes to the mother. Even animals. There are so many chicken, hens, they go after the mother.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They get milk from the mother, not from the father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. How to stop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> How could father feed even the child?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see, in all there are so many husbandless girls, and the children have not gone with the husbands, to the man. They are after the mother. How you'll have equal rights? They cannot. At this your heart will cry, "Oh, I have left my children, I am unhappy." That is... Just like our Hari-śauri's grandmother's advice to his mother to kill him. He said. And she refused. This is natural inclination. How... Artificially they are thinking like that, violating nature's law. Therefore they must suffer. As soon as you break <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā kartāham iti manyate [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> These rascals, on account of being misled by misconception of life, <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra,</span> false <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra, kartāham,</span> I can do everything. Any little pinch of nature's law, if you break, you'll suffer. <span class="Italic">Daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā duratyayā</span> [Bg. 7.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> You cannot escape. But still they're thinking, "We're independent." That is <span class="Italic">ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā,</span> by false prestige, by false identification. He is (indistinct) and he's thinking so many nonsense. <span class="Italic">Ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā.</span> Everything will be explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> So try to explain. That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's order, <span class="Italic">yāre dekha, tāre kaha, 'kṛṣṇa-upadeśa [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 7.128]<span class="Italic">.' Bas,</span> finished, "You become a guru." The trouble(?) is there. You haven't got to manufacture your ideas. Just like I'm quoting from Kṛṣṇa's preaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> They take objection when we preach. They say, "Have you seen God or Kṛṣṇa?" We haven't seen God, how could we speak about God? Sometimes they take objection.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good. You have not seen your grandfather, why do you take his will? To inherit the money. You have not seen your grandfather. You rascal, you are very much anxious to take his money, according to his will. What is the answer? You have not seen your grandfather, so why you take his will? Eh? What is his answer? Rascal while taking money: "I will take my grandfather's will." Just see. You have to learn how to capture the rascals. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadvaita:</span> ...living here for nine years but he doesn't know who God is.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is direction?</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya, jaya.</span> This is the difference: he is living here nine years, he does not. And here, cultivator, he knows how to offer obeisances. Where he is living?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadvaita:</span> I'm not sure exactly. I met him on Gopīnath Bazaar. He's living with some gentleman. He said that he came to Vṛndāvana nine years ago and he met this gentleman and took up studying with him. And he's reading all Vedic books, <span class="Italic">Atharva Veda, Yajur Veda,</span> like that, but he doesn't know...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Has he seen our books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How he is wasting his time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayadvaita:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> <span class="Italic">Vedeṣu durlābhaṁ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Adurlabham ātma-bhaktau.</span> If he would have approached a devotee, he'd have known this long ago. That man must be Māyāvādī, with whom he is associating.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> They cannot give anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī-bhāṣya sunile haya sarva-nāśa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">,</span> finished-his spiritual progress is finished if he associates with a Māyāvādī.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It says in the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> even if we look upon the face of a <span class="Italic">pāṣaṇḍī,</span> we should jump in the river with all our clothes on to become immediately purified, what to speak of giving any aural reception to them. But then again we see that Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu listened, you know, attentively for so many hours to Sarvabhauma Bhaṭṭācārya and also Prakāśānanda Sarasvatī. How is it can we understand...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just to see how the animal is jumping. (to passers-by:) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya, jaya.</span> (chuckles) Just like a fish is given freedom, even if he's caught up by the trap. It is like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> So Lord Caitanya had him on the line all the time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lord Caitanya was waiting, "Let the rascal go on speaking. How long he can speak?" (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He just waited till he dried up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> He's foolish. He knows that he has got some limited stock; it will be finished very soon, so "Let him finish, then I shall capture." That is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's policy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But should we take that example or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> We can also listen to the Māyāvādīs and then defeat them like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you are so qualified like Caitanya Mahāprabhu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> (laughs) Otherwise we should...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Otherwise you will be captured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Otherwise we shouldn't listen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jayādvaita:</span> In America that's called giving someone enough rope to hang himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> In South India, when we were down there, we had to do that. We listened to them first and then took their money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> But we also should defeat them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> Taking their money is defeating them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, what is the position of <span class="Italic">vrajavāsīs,</span> those who are living in Vṛndāvana now? What happens to them next life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Simply by living, if they do not commit any sinful, they'll go back to home. Simply by living. Without committing any sinful activities. Always remember Kṛṣṇa, this is Kṛṣṇa's land, <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto.</span> That will deliver them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> They don't need a spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Spiritual master is always needed. <span class="Italic">Chāḍiyā vaiṣṇava-sevā nistāra pāyeche kebā.</span> Without abiding by the orders of spiritual master and serving him, nobody can be. Otherwise rascal. He has accepted one rascal spiritual master, and he cannot understand what is God, nine years, because he did not accept spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> So all these local <span class="Italic">vrajavāsīs,</span> they all accept...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, <span class="Italic">vrajavāsīs,</span> they are... Generally, naturally, they are Kṛṣṇa conscious. Otherwise how is this illiterate farmer, he is offering? This is natural.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> But he has no spiritual master.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> He has a spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he has a spiritual master, yes. And even without spiritual master they have already elevated to Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pañcadraviḍa:</span> So they will go back home?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes, because spiritual master is within, <span class="Italic">caitya-guru.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Lokanātha:</span> You said one time Kṛṣṇa is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Mm. <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa-guru-kṛpā.</span> (end)</div>
