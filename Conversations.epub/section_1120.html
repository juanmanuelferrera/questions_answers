<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...at a time. Simply the sense must be there. <span class="Italic">Jñānavan. Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān māṁ prapadyante [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> To surrender to Kṛṣṇa is not easy, but if one is <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> he can do it. So make your country <span class="Italic">jñānavān,</span> not these rascals, unnecessarily wasting time by opposing us. They are rascals. So you have to turn these rascals into sense. Then it will take. Give them <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Let them chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Time will come, ours. Do it. I'll die, but you shall remain. You are all young men. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> After meeting with Mr. Narayana tomorrow I feel that I... What we first asked him for was some free advertisement, free advertising space that sometimes he gets. He says we'll have to write to Madras to the head office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That he'll do... If we get free, you send.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, if they just tell me that will take a week for them to get the answer, then should I wait for a week before starting the advertising campaign?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the free, that is consideration. Let them give freely. You take advantage.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> OK.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where is Jagadīśa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's in his room.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I called him. Where is that... I made the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Advertisement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Advertisement, yes. So just exactly to that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply I have not added the name.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And the list of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> List of... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just update it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Here are the spaces.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, for the addresses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Addresses. You can write. What is the address of the Vrnda Book Company?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I have it with me in my office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So write it there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This paper circulates more than the <span class="Italic">Times.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Combined. But not individually by city.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> But it's very close. Just in this city, Bombay, only twenty thousand papers difference. In Delhi, bigger circulation than <span class="Italic">Times.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Competition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Very competitive. And it's overall much more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, it's a fine paper. Therefore we decided.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Please see that there is no printing mistake.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we won't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, Śrīla Prabhupāda. I'm giving Bombay address; Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Hare Kṛṣṇa Land, Juhu, Bombay; Bhaktivedanta Book Trust; and the Delhi address. Delhi temple also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Why Delhi temple? They are not executing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. Because we have a good stock of books over there also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that is another thing. But they have no department for executing. They will be embarrassed when they receive order.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> OK, Bhaktivedanta Book Trust, Bombay and Bengal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give the full address.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I'm waiting for Jagadīśa to bring. Including the telephone number on the bottom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Very often people just call up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> In India when they have ads like this, Gopāla, do they have coupons?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Couponing is just introduced, being introduced in India. They'll not take.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Telephone number, I think, Vrnda has also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, he just got a phone. Lever Brothers, they've been experimenting with couponing in India. Not very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This man invited us to have the books reviewed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I saw that. We're going to work on that now, even get these books reviewed by <span class="Italic">Times of India</span> and all... So this is free publicity, and this is respected publicity. They also have a telephone number now. I have seen in the news. I have it in my office.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Telephone number?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think I have got. Yes, 617796</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 617796. If we give their address, then is postbox address then necessary?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Postbox? Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It is not necessary. Yes, that's what I'm asking. It's not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the address?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 30 by 1B College Row, Calcutta 70009.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or Calcutta 9 is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Now they have the Pin code. Zip Code, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Phone number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, I have that. Telephone 617796. Now one question on pricing. <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> we are selling it to the libraries for forty-five rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. It is not the question of library. What is the general price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The general price is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Lower.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. The general price is higher. What's the U.S. registered price? They're just asking that... It comes about seventy rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't make duplicity pricing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Exactly. That is why I'm discussing with you right now, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Our pricing will be consistent. So I think forty-five rupees is reasonable. Above that, in India people will hesitate on buying. I'd like to get everyone to think it is available at...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why forty-five? We can reduce more even, do you think.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He's already charging the libraries forty-five rupees.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So we can't go below that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...because then they...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā As It Is,</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.... [break] What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Lower the better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. That is what I'm saying. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We are selling so many <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> in America because we lowered the price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you consult and do.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Did you mention about the loans for Bhūṣaṇa? Another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I had spoken to you earlier that we can expand our printing, especially in India...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So now you have received nine <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth books. So how you'll pay?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nine <span class="Italic">lakhs'</span> worth of books?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> From America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. As we sell these, this money can be put into construction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have to inform them. He'll send less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I'll work that arrangement out with him before he goes back.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I have told Rāmeśvara Mahārāja that before he goes back to America he should spend a day with me so we can work all these things out. So after he leaves you, he will spend...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything should be done businesslike.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We don't want anything free.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> All first class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can pay for things now. I'm just addressing Rāmeśvara Mahārāja's help in getting our exports done. Once...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He will help you, and then you can, you also, big business. You...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. These exports will give India a very good income.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Or you can exchange. Whatever money you have received, you supply books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The government will insist on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No. The government will insist that we get foreign exchange, and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, if credit builds, you send less money.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I got a letter from Bali-mardana Mahārāja. He's ordered four thousand... Today I got a letter. He says... He's ordered the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> also. Four thousand copies of First Canto, Part Two, he ordered already. So this one is four thousand copies, Śrīla Prabhupāda...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Indian printed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, I'm printing that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right on that, there's already a profit of more than twenty thousand rupees. So just with export...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can return that twenty thousand rupees I have given you for Jayapataka. (laughter) Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Actually, we will invest that as further expansion, but if you want...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you should also take it as loan.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This all, advertisement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Certainly. It is business.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> From one pocket to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Okay. So Bali-mardana says... I just got his letter today.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I had one... When I was doing medical business I had one very nice customer. He was my patron also, one Muhammadan doctor, Sriraja Uttina.(?) He was very kind to me. He was just like a father to me. So his system was that in his pharmacy, patent medicine, drugs, medicine, surgical instruments, like that different headings. So suppose, at the sales time, sells some patent medicine. So he has got a box. So he puts the price in the patent medicine. And if he sells some surgical, he puts the price in the surgical pot. In this way, when they want to purchase again, so he would consult his pot, whether there is money. Then he'll allow to purchase. Otherwise not. So he told me, "This is my account. This is my account. When they want to purchase, they consign us something. I shall allow them to purchase so much as I have got in the box." This is... I have seen that gentleman. And in Calcutta there was... In our young time there was a cinema, Mr. Maddar, J.F. Maddar. He's a Parsee. So for some..., business, he was tenant of mine. One of my tenants. So in his room there were boxes. So I asked Mr. Maddar what is this box at home. And "This is the counter containing counter part of ticket in my cinema house. So these are sent to me. I count the counter part. Then I can calculate, 'This is the calculation.' I don't keep an account. Now let them do whatever they like. I understand that so many counter parts, so much money."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bali-mardana writes to me that he even wants to order 7.2 and 7.3 from India. So what I'm saying is the demand is there for our books. Because we are selling the <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> for one dollar forty-five cents, same quality with plastic cover and two or three ribbon.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, one thing is that if you export, you will come to the light of the government. They want. And then you will get a good supply of paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We can import paper also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So that's why I want you to spend a day or two. We have so many things I want to cover with you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He can send paper?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, what I had earlier written to him was we can import paper and I can give the money into construction. And because I have... I know the Joint Chief Control of Imports and Exports in Delhi, and he told me he would give me a license to import paper duty free. So we can import paper which you can pay for in Singapore, you follow? I'll give you the dealer, everything. And the paper will come. We'll print...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You supplied paper to Japan, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can supply the paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> And now, whenever we print books in America, we supply paper. It's much cheaper if we buy it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We do the printing. I buy all the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> The printer will mark it up if he has to spend his money for paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. In India also we buy the paper ourselves. We buy the paper and give it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good. Supply paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're dealing with all the paper mills directly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> You take good savings that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And also the printer likes it because it doesn't enter his account.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Printer loves it. The printer doesn't have to spend his money on paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not only that, if he makes bill for the paper, then he has to pay sales tax.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Also the income tax will say, "Your sales were so high," so he doesn't want the paper account to come under that. So what I'm saying, Śrīla Prabhupāda... The demand for our books is there. And like BBT Los Angeles sells a <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> to the temples for $3.50, and we are selling it for $1.45. And that includes our profit already. Our real cost is 90 cents, 95 cents. So we can expand our printing capacity here. As I discussed with you last week, there's one machine from England that Usa Printers wants to import. And if we give him a loan... It will be his machine. He'll give us documents, and he'll pay back interest every month. In two years he'll pay back the whole money plus interest, which will be higher than what the bank gives us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What is the bank rate?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The bank rate's about 12%. We'll do higher than the bank rate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bank rate is not less than 16%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He is only offering 12% a year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, he'll give us more than the bank rate. Whatever rate the bank lends at, we'll get more than that. That's understood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may mean... "More than bank rate" means bank allows to their customer not more than 10%. But if you take loan from bank...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I know he will give more. That loan...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take loan... The interest is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, the borrowing loan. He will give more than that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The borrowing loan is not less than 16%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 15%... Yes. He'll offer 25%.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> I think this is a good idea because the printer will be indebted to us.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And now we also need his help to make... I went all over India looking for printers.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So do it immediately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> This is a good opportunity for us to have a very solid relationship with the printer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm. That's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also if we can give these <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams</span> for a dollar to America, they can import it from here also, and as I told Rāmeśvara Mahārāja, we can give a plastic cover plus two or three ribbons. Insured, it will cost nothing extra.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You decide for (indistinct) why not.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> We're going to discuss it at the Māyāpura festival with Tamāla Kṛṣṇa Swami, because he's in charge of distribution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> He has to approve the quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The quality's only a little inferior.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I don't think India can make such quality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> we did came very close, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It may come to close, but not to... Then that's all right. If it is possible, we can...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like Jayatīrtha wrote to me. He prefers the Indian <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> to the American because it is economical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Because it is... Yes, because of the price.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We all have to be realistic. The price...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now Jayatīrtha is going first in selling, more than anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> During the... During one week of Christmas he defeated Los Angeles. (Prabhupāda chuckles)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> He's taking (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh, yes, he did.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He was third on that list.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> His one temple defeated any other temple. His one temple was the number one temple, but as a whole zone...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Jayatīrtha is also good business. (chuckles) He has got good business brain. So do it nicely and Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> This will be very good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More work; more use your intelligence. <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā:</span> with life, with money, with intelligence, with words to serve Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Etāvaj janma-sa-phala tvam.</span> This is the perfection of life. How? <span class="Italic">Etāvaj janma-sal..., janma-sa-phala tvam dehinām iha dehiṣu. Iha dehi...</span> This, in human body... Those who have got body as dog, cats, they have got body. But <span class="Italic">iha dehiṣu,</span> this human form for perfection... And how that perfection is achieved? <span class="Italic">Prāṇair arthair dhiyā vācā śreya ācaraṇaṁ sadā:</span> "With your life, with your money, with your intelligence, with your words, serve." That is perfect life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Today we have an engagement at the Gujarati... What was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nathdvar?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> In Bombay. In the city we have a...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So books are selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Which ones selling?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> Well, they want mostly in Gujarati. They didn't read Hindi. There is magazines and <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This magazine you have got?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. We have stock of Gujarati books also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this magazine.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh. Not this one. This one hasn't arrived.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> This is a rupee and a half.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> These covers I did in Bombay. These are books from the other covers. They came out very good. Ādi-rasa was telling me, in a week we'll also do the black and white in Bombay, because the quality is going to be better.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You make expert, on quality expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We are doing all the Gujarati covers in Bombay now, and I wrote to Jayapataka. We can even do the Bengali printing here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In India, Bombay is best. There are many offset printing houses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Like in the Bengali <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> they did in Calcutta, they spent eight paisa more per copy printing than Bombay, and quality was much inferior. So now I said, "You compose over there..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Typeset is Delhi good, but offset-Bombay.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So what I've told them, Śrīla Prabhupāda, is they can get the composing done in Bengal, Calcutta, then send it to me, like I get the Hindi composing done in Vṛndāvana and mail it to Bombay for printing. So it is cheaper and good quality, plus we have the whole department set up. One boy, Pippalai, he just takes care of technical aspects. And we have a shipping department all set up now. Two boys work just on the shipping.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So supply department keep in one place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. And we have very good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In other places it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't have the men, and we have good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They supply all supplies. The orders should be supplied from one place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We're getting up to two months' credit on printing books. Everything is nicely set up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But keep your credit.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. I have very good credit, even with the paper manufacturers. They just give us the paper right away. We have very good credit at the moment because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that? You were asking something?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> No, I was just taking notes. Bali-mardana has ordered forty thousand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> for Australia.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> From India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> From India, forty thousand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I got an order from Jayatīrtha for sixty thousand. (Prabhupāda chuckles) And this is just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> His wife is good businesswoman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Bali-mardana's.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Bali-mardana.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> She can do very good business. Is it not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yeah. First they were hesitating, Śrīla Prabhupāda. So what I did is I told Jayatīrtha that Australia has already ordered, so he said, "Okay, I'll order sixty thousand." I told Australia that "England's already ordered," so he said, "I'll order forty thousand." (chuckling) We had to get the thing started at once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, Australia, from India it is nearer, half-day(?).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> What is your printing cost on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> About 11.50, eleven rupees, fifty paisa. But the export edition is going to be cheaper because when you export, you get a lot of duties, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, in export and exchange with paper, good paper.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We can import paper. The government will let us import paper for exporting without any problem. But I'm just saying that the export edition of <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> is going to cost us about two rupees less than the Indian edition for Indian market because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why not import paper? It will be very nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Because on paper now there's high duty, but if it is for export, the government...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then America can order from you also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> On the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> his price is not better than America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That is because of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> America, the printing is better and the price is better on the <span class="Italic">Gītā,</span> because we are printing so many copies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> On the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> the prices are better here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is a quantity. They are giving nice price for large quantity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Even though the price is better in America, he is getting the market because he is selling it for less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> And we are going to order few small extras. We're going to offer a few small extras like small ribbons with plastic cover.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Has Prabhupāda told you how much profit you should make? Because in America you have always said it should be marked up one hundred percent. If a book costs us one dollar, we should sell to the temple at two dollars. So your book is costing over one dollar, and you are only selling it for $1.45.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, no. The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam's</span> costing less. The <span class="Italic">Gītās</span> we are selling for $1.50.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> The <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatams...</span> Also the freight from here is less. That's another feeling that we have. Prabhupāda told me England, Australia, Africa should get books from India, and America, Canada, from America.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no consideration of big profit. Simply we want big number, distribution. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Also this will increase our prestige as a movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big number, as big as possible. My Guru Mahārāja, he had magazines in six languages: English, Hindi, Bengali, Oriya, Assamese, and one Bengali daily. So if our men complained that "Such and such men are not giving their subscription, so, what we can do? Stop the supply?" Oh, he would become very angry. He asked them, "Are you commercial-hired fools? No! Supply free!" He used to say like that. He was asking, "Whether we shall stop supply? The subscription is not coming." So immediately he became angry: "Are you commercial-hired? If he's not giving price, supply him free." That was his policy. So less perfect or..., try to see how many numbers of books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes. Because once BBT India starts making profit, then the burden on BBT America will also be lessened. BBT India can start giving money for construction and other things. I foresee that if BBT India goes on, next, in 1977 we should make a profit of at least twenty-five <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees, twenty-five to thirty <span class="Italic">lakhs.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. And open center village to village, town to town. <span class="Italic">Pṛthivīte āche yata nagarādi-grāma.</span> See first printing is very first class and it is distributed very widely. Not shabby thing. No. Just like our Godbrothers, they printed... They have no printing; still, whatever they print, all shabby.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Full of mistakes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Full of mistakes. Full of mistakes, the get-up is not good, but they'll sell. And they print only in Bengali.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Rāmeśvara:</span> Thank you, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
