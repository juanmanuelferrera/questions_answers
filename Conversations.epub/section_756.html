<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda: </span>What is the thesis of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> According to who?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Anyone. Some people say that life is to be enjoyed. Life is simply there for enjoyment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the answer is that whether you are actually enjoying life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, right now I'm not actually enjoying life, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...I have to find out...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then the aim is to enjoy life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. So I have to find out the means to enjoy, and to negate the pain and to make the pleasure more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's very nice proposal, but whether, at the present moment, or in the history, whether a man is enjoying life or suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, men, men have actually never really enjoyed because they never understood enough about themselves. They were never able to overcome their difficulties due to ignorance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So then the next question will be that how to become enjoyable, or how to enjoy? The next question is.... There may be different thesis. So our thesis is that we are trying to enjoy life by covering ourself. The crude example.... Just like sometimes before, the.... It may be nowadays also current. The contraceptive method was by using one cover. Do you know that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Hmh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is called?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Prophylactic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> A prophylactic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not prophylactic. Technical name. So, but that was not enjoyable. So then they discovered pills. So covered enjoyment is not enjoyment. It is not complete enjoyment. The same.... The real enjoyment in this material world is sex. Now if we want to enjoy sex, covered with coats and pants, is that enjoyment is pleasing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore actually when they want to enjoy sex in the private room, they become naked. So they are seeking enjoyment with this material body, but they are not able to enjoy on account of being covered. This is the thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Hmmm. This is the Kṛṣṇa conscious thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, why do you come to Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately? From practical point of view. So why they want to enjoy sex life being naked? That means covered enjoyment is not enjoyment. It is hampered enjoyment. Therefore we living entities, or, say, human beings, we want enjoyment. That's all right. But we are not able to enjoy fully because we are covered by something. This is the thesis. This is the thesis. But these rascals, or the ignorant persons, they do not know that "I am covered by something. Therefore my enjoyment is not complete." This is the thesis. So you answer this. Our enjoyment is not being completed on account of being covered by this material body. This is the thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the antithesis would be there is no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The antithesis will be how to become uncovered. That is antithesis. And the synthesis will be that because we are unable to uncover immediately, therefore must be some synthesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, I never thought of it that way. That's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. The synthesis of the covering and the thesis of the soul should be synthesized by arrangement. That we are teaching.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Dialectical spiritualism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ye.... Not dia.... Dialectical means keep spiritualism or materialism. It is dialectic. Two sides there are, the material and the spiritual. These ignorant rascals, cats-and dogslike men, they have no information of the thing which is covered. They're simply dealing with the covering. Therefore their knowledge is imperfect, and they're not successful by so many theses. They do not know the real problem. Who is enjoyer? That they do not know. That enjoyer is covered. And they are talking on the cover. That.... In Bengal, it is a proverb, said, that: <span class="Italic">Sobraniye tanatan.</span>(?) In the.... I think I was talking on this. In the coconut. The coconut sweet pulp and water is within. And they are struggling with the fibers above the coconut. Coconut.... They have got some information coconut is enjoyable, but where is the enjoyable article is there, that they do not know. They have simply information this body, and the coconut's body is covered with fibers. And they are fighting with the fibers. None of these so-called capitalists or, what is called, Communists, they do not know where is the real substance is. Superficially, they are fighting on the platform of fiber covering. That's all. <span class="Italic">Sobraniye tanatan,</span>(?) this Bengali word exactly. They're fighting just like dogs. Actually they do not know how to become happy, but one dog is barking upon another dog, and they're fighting, attacking, barking-useless. The dogs and cats, they do not know what is the value of life, and they fight on the covering, same fiber, fight. But here is a chance, human being. Therefore dialectic. Dialectic materialism. You should be materialist; you should not condemn anything, both the inside and outside. The inside pulp of coconut requires the covering outside. Otherwise, it will be spoiled. Crude example. But the real substance is inside, not outside. But these rascals, they have no information of the inside substance. They think that "Here is coconut. Let us try to find out happiness." And they are simply struggling to adjust the fibers. Therefore they have been described as <span class="Italic">mūḍhaḥ,</span> rascals. Hmmm? What do you think, Haṁsadūta?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Very perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Completely smashed all the opposition. No more arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you have to do this, to fight all these rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> 'Cause all philosophy is based on the proposition that "I am this body."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Or "I am this..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he remains the same animal, cats and dogs. There is no advancement. Therefore you see despite so many rascal philosophers in the Western countries, they simply fight and bomb and cheat and politics, diplomacy. The same-on the surface of the coconut, not inside. So you have to prove that "All of you are rascals. You do not know where to get pleasure." They're missing that point. All rascals, they're putting new philosophy, thesis. So what is the value of that thesis? He does not know. It requires expert. Just like somebody has told: "In this land, there is gold." So somebody's digging here, somebody's digging there, somebody's digging there. And they are, do not find gold, and struggling. But one expert, what is called, soil expert?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Geologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Geologist. No, geologist and soil ex..., soil expert.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Minerologist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Mineralogist.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He can say: "Here is gold. You dig here. Here is the gold mine." Then you get gold mine. And one who is not expert, simply he has understood that "In this area, there is gold mine," and they are simply fighting; everyone has come to take the gold. But without expert knowledge, they're simply fighting. They do not find gold. That is the position. So expert knowledge is Kṛṣṇa. He therefore begins: <span class="Italic">dehino 'smin yathā dehe kaumāraṁ yauvanaṁ jarā [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> Within this body, the living force, that is the soul. Because that soul is there, it is changing body, different. Try to understand that active principle. And where is that understanding? They simply putting different theses. They do not, neither do they know antithesis or synthesis. So our.... We know the thesis, antithesis and synthesis, that this soul, living entity, is within this body. Now the body is important so long the soul is there. Otherwise, body is a lump of matter. So the soul is suffering. He's seeking after enjoyment, but he's suffering. So therefore.... The most prominent suffering is death. That he cannot avoid. Or he's not.... The so-called materialistic scientists, they have not been able, neither they do know, who is the sufferer or enjoyer. They take this body. The same fiber platform. So actually they are rascals. What is the value of the thesis, antithesis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So actually everything.... All the arguments they bring up is simply the material thesis. There is no antithesis 'cause.... Just like hot and cold. Hot is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. They're seeking-the same example-the enjoyable thing, on the platform of shell of the coconut, fibers of the coconut. They do not know that within the shell, within the fiber, there is coconut. That they do not know. You said two sides. But they do not know the other side. They only know the one side, the body. There will be synthesis when there are two. But they have no two. They simply one subject matter, the body, and that is useless struggle. It is just like <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs. Neti neti:</span> "Not this, not this. Not this, not this." Therefore they advocate revolution, that something is going on for some days; again revolution. That means "Not this." <span class="Italic">Neti neti.</span> The experiment says.... Experiment. Everyone is doing that. They are trying to derive happiness through some system or idea of adjustment, but it becomes spoiled and useless after some time. Therefore they say another revolution required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In the dictionary, that, the definition of experiment was you try it and see if it works.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if it is not perfect, how it will work?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And experiment means, those who are making experiment, they do not know where is the perfect thing. The same example, that if you make experiment about understanding who is your father, it will all fail. How long you'll go on inquiring, ask any old man, "Sir, are you my father?" Or will this process be successful at any time? Without consulting your mother, if you simply go on asking all old men, "Sir, are you my father?" And if somebody falsely says, "Yes, I am your father," is that successful inquiry? This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it gives mental satisfaction, and that, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is rascaldom. Mental satisfaction. Just like a child. You can cheat him by mental satisfaction, giving him one lozenges and take from him hundred rupees note.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But he's satis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also mental satisfaction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But happiness is a state of mind. So the child is happy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Such mind is imperfect. What is this satisfaction? If mind is imperfect, so mental satisfaction is never complete satisfaction. That is also another illusion. It will be changed again. Again revolution. This is going on. So in the dialectic process, try to bring this thesis, that within this body there is the real enjoyer, and try to convince them in that way. That will be great service.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You've already done it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I've done with a few selected men. Now it has to be spread. We have to face bigger field. Then it will be nice. Hm? Thesis, antithesis and synthesis. This is good. This is scientific method. So, so what is that thesis? That thesis is given by Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa gave the thesis: <span class="Italic">asmin dehe,</span> the proprietor of the body is there. Within this body.... This is thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Actually though, the, the thesis in Engel's philosophy would start off with the present existence, the present reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It starts with the present, what is now presently existing, and then the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, presently or.... That is another foolishness. The, the body and the moving active principle is eternally existing. It is not that formerly the body did not stop acting. It is dead. Study the whole history of human beings, any being-the death is always there. Then what is modern effort? Birth, death, old age, disease. They're always existing. Why do they say "modern"? This is eternal fact. Why they should say it is modern?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's the present culmination of synthesis and antithesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. That is their imperfect knowledge. They do not know. What is thesis, what is antithesis, and the synthesis, they do not know. As philosophers, they have found out the three things. But so far the solution of the problem of human society.... You cannot solve the problems of animals' society. That is not possible. So this thesis can be understood by human beings. The animals cannot understand it, that within this body the soul is there. On account of presence of the soul, everything is going on, bodily affair. This thesis cannot be understood by the animals. So if you cannot understand, then you are also animal, although you are two-legged. So what is the value of your thesis, antithesis? You are animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I think a thesis, it would be described in the dictionary as a proposition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Who can give proposition unless one is human being? The dog cannot give proposition. The animal cannot give proposition. So who is giving this proposition throughout the Western world, that within this body there is the real person? Who understands this? Therefore they're all animals. What is the value of their so-called philosophy? What do you think? <span class="Italic">Yasyātmā buddhiḥ kunāpe tri-dhātuke [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> If he's in the bodily concept of life, then he remains animal. What is the value of his thesis? Now here is the thesis. Now antithesis is also there. Actually we are trying to adjust. Only society. The thesis is the soul. The antithesis is the body. And synthesis is how to adjust the body and soul so that the soul be benefited from this entanglement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> That's the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> system?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is different thing only.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> O.K.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lat.... First of all, this is the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> First to find out the problem...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...and discuss the problem.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is dialectic. So you can write <span class="Italic">dialectic spiritualism.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Dialectic spiritualism. I think they should print this also in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It'd make a good article.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It would make a good article, what you've just spoken.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So write.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You so completely destroy the opposition, it's very hard to say anything more.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That you have to prove. You can eulogize your Guru Mahārāja, but you have to learn it and face the public and be strong to defend yourself. That is success. Not by praising your Guru Mahārāja. You'll praise your Guru Mahārāja. That is not very difficult. But be victorious to the opposing elements. Then you will praise your Guru Mahārāja nicely. At home, you can praise your Guru Mahārāja, and Guru Mahārāja be satisfied, "Oh, my disciples are praising me." That is not very.... That is good. Respectful. That is the qualification. But you have to fight. Then your Guru Mahārāja will be glorified.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The problem nowadays though is that I met some of these Socialists on the train, and I would ask them, "What is your philosophy?" and they would just smile and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no philosophy. They're cats and dogs. What philosophy they have?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They don't know their philosophy. So how can we defeat them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The philosophy classes are being closed now in the universities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It is useless.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. They're thinking it is useless, simply mental speculation. And <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says, <span class="Italic">tattva jñānārthaṁ darśanam.</span> Philosophy means to find out the ultimate truth. That is philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But actually this is the proof of Marx's philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Therefore I say the dialectic. The dialectics should proceed further. They have ended this, that the workers should be the proprietor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So now the, the, the, there's no philosophy. So the workers, they are simply frustrated. Now they're going to rebel and revolt without any philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That will be natural. Because if you cannot live perfect philosophy, then they will revolt. <span class="Italic">Andhā yathāndhaiḥ...</span> You are a rascal, and you're trying to lead other rascals with some rascal philosophy. How long this rascaldom will go on?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So there's no need for any movement...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...Communist movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is need of movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, no. I mean there's no need for any organized Communist movement, because according to their philosophy...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, because they're fools. They're as fools. They are simply criticizing the capitalists, that much. That much, there is something ideal that the state property should be equally divided. That's a good thesis. But they do not know that it is not the ultimate solution. You do not know who is the proprietor. You do not know the proprietor. These things belong to Him. You are using it. I am thinking that "You are proprietor." But actually you are not proprietor. He is proprietor. If that is the position, then I take it from you that: "You cannot possess. I shall possess." Then what is my possess? The same thing. As you took it, took it out from this man, so I took it, take it from you. So my position is the same. If you cannot find out who is the actual proprietor, then you may change hands. The problem remains there, that it, it does not belong to you. You are forcibly snatching from the proprietor, or without knowing the proprietor, you are making arrangement. What is the value of this arrangement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So it's just the animal philosophy of the strong dominating the weak...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That's it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...in, in a new package.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "Might is right." That's all. This is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this was the philosophy of Machiavelli, that "Might makes right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But Machiavelli also does not know who is the proprietor. That is the defect. Machiavelli also does not know. He's also another fool. So long you do not know who is the proprietor, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But it's true. Might does make right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Kṛṣṇa is the strongest.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the proprietor." But they'll not accept it. Kṛṣṇa says, the real proprietor says, that "I am the <span class="Italic">bhokta. Sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span>" But they are so rascal that they will deny the existence of Kṛṣṇa or God, or the real proprietor. They claim to be proprietor for a few days, and they, by one slap of Kṛṣṇa's hand, they finished all proprietorship, and they are going, struggling. This ignorance is prevailing all over the world. Does not know who is the proprietor, how I became proprietor, how I shall be enjoying. Nothing. The same thing, the dog philosophy: if the dog secures a morsel of bread, he's thinking, "I am proprietor." Another one snatches: "I am proprietor." This is going on. But the dog has no sense that none of us will be proprietor. So when you know who is the proprietor, then this <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad.... Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā. Īśāvāsyam idaṁ sarvam [Īśo mantra 1].</span> Everything, God's property. You enjoy for livelihood what is given to you. That's all. That is perfect philosophy. "I am the proprietor." That was the system in Vedic civilization. God is proprietor. King is the representative of God. He knows.... He gives you some land, that "You take this land, produce your livelihood, utilizing this land, and whatever you produce, one fourth give me." Not a fixed tax. "If you produce, one fourth is mine. If you don't produce, there is no tax." This was the system. And that includes all tax. No botheration. So people were God-fearing, honest, simple-dealing. So "I have produced a hundred mounds of rice. The king, you can take twenty-five mounds. That is my obligation." And king is also satisfied. By distributing that grain, he maintains the whole government. The real difficulty is all these rascals, they are not sufficiently educated. They are <span class="Italic">mūḍhas.</span> And they are trying to solve the problems. That is not possible. That is <span class="Italic">andhā yathāndhair upanīyamānāḥ [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are bound up. They're making adjustment, but.... Just like Gandhi. For making adjustment, all of a sudden a man came, (makes sound like gun) <span class="Italic">khat.</span> Finished. Kennedy was making some adjustment. Somebody came and killed him. It is like that. What is the value of your adjustments? It will be finished after some days. Therefore the Russians, they support revolution. They said, "It is necessary." They admit the imperfectness. And occasional revolution makes it perfect. This is their idea of perfection. But they do not inquire that "What is that supreme power which makes our ideas of perfection imperfect?" These rascals, they do not never, do not ever inquire, "What is that power which forces to make our attempt frustrated, spoil, and make it imperfect?" What do they say about this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They never come to this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> They never come to this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see how rascal they are. This is the fact. We make some arrangement, and after few years it becomes imperfect. They say the revolution required. Why? That is natural. And natural means a power which makes your arrangement spoiled. Then what is your brain? You have got some superior brain which nullifies your plan. Why don't you accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Like breaking the law and being thrown in jail...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...after you are caught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> ...and then wondering why.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He does not know that "I was imperfect, thief. Therefore I have put into jail." So we can face any philosopher. But I can give you ideas. You can write some small articles. Let them solve these thesis, antithesis and synthesis. They, they accept this thesis, antithesis?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, yeah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Put them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And actually it's, it works very nicely because the thesis doesn't have to be accepted as a fact in the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But discuss on.... That is dialectic. Complete discussion. That is wanted. That we want.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So now if they're actually interested in the scientific method, they must accept our thesis for discussion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Dialectic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And then they can put...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have accepted dialectic. They.... Marx says that this should be the conclusion of materialism: ultimately the worker shall enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Fruitive, it's very fruitive.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is good idea. But who is the worker, he does not know. Write small pamphlet. Just like our Svarūpa Dāmodara has written small pamphlet. People, general people, they're also rascals, <span class="Italic">andhā.</span> They can accept these rascals. But why we shall accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This is experimental philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that.... Experimental philosophy means rascaldom. You do not know actually what is the fact. Then you make experiment. That means you are rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I meant that this thesis, antithesis...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like Kṛṣṇa does not say, "Make an experiment." He says the fact: <span class="Italic">asmin dehe dehinaḥ.</span> "The proprietor of the body is within this body." There is no question of experimenting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But that's our thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not.... I say "thesis." Kṛṣṇa do.... Kṛṣṇa says the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I mean in order to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But if you don't accept Kṛṣṇa's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yeah, they don't accept. So that, that's our thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Then, then take it as thesis.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Thesis. So therefore it's an experiment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not experiment. It is to be subjected to discussion. That is not experiment. Because the fact is there. Now whether it is fact, that you have to discuss.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So this experimental knowledge should be strictly kept in the scientific realm. You know, discussion...? Because you asked me before to write on...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The scientific knowledge is already there, but as you do not accept it, then the question of discussion, or, you say, experiment, can come. The truth is already there. Just like the sun is the truth, is there. Everyone knows. Now somebody says "There is no light," and somebody says "There is light." Now it has to be discussed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> In this book, Lenin has a dialogue. He makes these dialogues. At his.... I was just looking quickly. There's some dialogue here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that dialogue?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> I haven't looked into it exactly, but I've seen.... This is too...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's too insane to read quickly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, read it. Let us see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> OK. "The fundamental premises of the theory of knowledge of Mock(?) and Averniu..., Avanarias(?) are frankly, simply and clearly expounded by them in their early philosophical works. To these works we shall now turn, postponing for later treatment an examination of the corrections and ammendations subsequently made by these writers. 'The task of science,' Mock(?) wrote in 1872, 'can only be: 1. to determine the laws of connection of ideas, psychology; 2. to discover...' "</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not science, ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's saying to determine the laws of connection of ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He says he wants to determine the laws of connection of ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But idea is also not fact. And what is other word?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> "The laws of connection of ideas."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If the idea is imperfect, then where is, what is the meaning of this law? That is also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, actually there's three things here. And they work together. 'Cause he calls this psychology. And the second one...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But psychology is also imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So, yes, he's going to now connect that with physics. He says, "To discover the laws of connections of sensations..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But physics, physical law, also, you are studying with your imperfect senses. So how far it is perfect? Just like the physical laws. There is heat in the sun, temperature. So you are seeing from long distance, and you are suggesting, "There cannot be any light." So this is imperfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, what about the law of physics...? Oh, it's going to run out of tape. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...no practical experience, actually, what is the position of the sun, because you cannot go there. So I may theori.... Here, here.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> Do this side first and then that side.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, he's actually saying that this is the task of science. He's not speaking about the idea of there's life or not in the sun. What he's thinking of here is, for example, a sensation. A sensation is an actual fact. Just like if..., there's a law that says equal and opposite reaction to actions. If I push some thing, some object, that, as this object is being pushed this way, there is simultaneously an equal and opposite reaction which is the force between the object and the floor, and the reaction comes in heat or friction...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, who made this arrangement?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So that arrangement is a law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that law. Who made this law?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's just a physical combination of matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Physical combination, then these physical activities are more powerful than your ideas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yes. Therefore the third thing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you have no control over the physical activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> No, we have control because I have to push this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you have no control.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But I am pushing this. It is my will.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. If you will that "Let the sun be cool," will it be cool? You have no control over the physical elements. You have no control. So what is the use of your theorizing? That is foolish.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, he's giving here the idea of science, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's a connection...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You have no complete science. You see some sporadic action of the scientific method. Just like we are in the sunshine. This is scientific. But you do not know how the sunshine is coming, and who is there, who is supplying the heat and light and so on. So many things are there. You do not know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So your idea is that there's a limit to all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Because...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...anything, any ideas made by imperfect man is useless. That is our, our proposition. You are imperfect, and the sun is so perfect, physically, that how you can theorize unless you know the whole expert. If you say "I know everything," then the question will be: "Who made this sun? So powerful, so extraordinarily heated and light. Who made it?" You did..., you have not made it. Where is your, that knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> As I read on, I find out that it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These are all speculation. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Definitely. Useless book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Useless speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But this, this argument that's being brought up here, actually people are thinking about a lot, that there's an idea and there's, there's a fact...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That argument is.... Just like I told you, in my childhood I was thinking in the gramophone box there is a man. I could not think at that time without a man how this gramophone can sing so nicely. So there is a man, and as soon as the record is..., he gives, he sings. That.... I was thinking like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So he would say that you thought there was a man there, but actually there wasn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And somebody say one ghost. Or somebody may say something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But there wasn't.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But they're all imperfect knowledge. I may say man, you may say ghost, others may say something, but all of them are rascaldom. It has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So the third step in science means to see the fact and make the idea according to the fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> So his method is the method of speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> First, there's the idea; the second, there's the real fact; and the third, there's the synthesis between the two.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're all theories. The same experiment. To find out who is my father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> All these guys are very dry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It has no meaning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> There's just talking. No value whatsoever. You can't even argue nicely with these men. They're just...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, you cannot argue with dogs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Waste of time. They'll simply keep on barking.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we can place our, what is called, facts, as we learn from Kṛṣṇa, and try to defend it. That is argument.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then if somebody has any intelligence left, he'll take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot begin with this sun. The beginning of educating is that put this thesis, as Kṛṣṇa is putting, that, that this body is not all in all. Within the body, there is soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Unless that's understood, there's no question of knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If, in the beginning, or on the basic principles, he remains a rascal, then there is no knowledge. If he does not understand that there is soul within this body, then he remains animal. What is the value of animal's speculation? <span class="Italic">Sa eva go-kharaḥ [SB </span>10.84.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> So we shall treat them as animals. So what, what we have got to learn from the animals? They're not interested. Now let.... You can accuse: "Why you should say animals?" I may say, "You are animals." That's all right. Just come to discussion, whether you are animal or I am animal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Calmly come to discussion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This the..., this theory is going on perpetually, whether there is soul or not. But these people, these Russians, they are so ignorant, they will not allow anybody to believe that there is soul. Atheistic, stubborn atheistic. Although they cannot answer this question that there must be something superior which is moving this body. And they cannot answer the, what is that superior element.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> The unknown chemical.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not unknown. It is unknown to you. But known to us. If it is unknown to you, you take, you know it from me. That is real knowledge. Why you persist that "It is unknown"? It should remain ever unknown? Why shall I take from anyone else? That's a fact. Either you answer what is that element which is missing so that the body is now dead. Simply your denial is obstinacy. That is dog's obstinacy. Then you are like a dog. You answer that: "This is the reason." Make experiment; prove it. Then you are right. So long you cannot do it, simply denying, that is dog's obstinacy. If you, as you say, there is no soul, it is chemical combination, so bring the chemicals and put him into life. Then your statement is right. You cannot do it and simply persist. This is doggish. You are calling a lump of matter your father, your child, your relative, and when the soul is gone, you say, "Oh, my father is gone." Why your father is gone? He's lying there on the bed. The same coat, pant, face, ear, eyes. Why do you say, "My father has gone"? What is this nonsense? So that chemical combination is your father? Bring your father again, chemical combination. Hmm? What is the answer? Some foolish, rubbish thing, presentation, will it be accepted as knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Another point.... I just thought of. They say it's some chemical which is missing that's making life, yet, if the same chemical is there that's making life, what accounts for so many different varieties of life? If it's the same chemical, how is there so many different varieties from that same chemical?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> And if it's a different chemical, that means there's so many thousands and billions of chemicals. Yet they can't even find one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They do not know even one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They don't even know one of them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) And still you are proud. What is this nonsense? And supposing the chemical combination is there and is being administered in different way for different life, then who is making this arrangement? Somebody's there who is making arrangement. You cannot do that. Therefore we are inferior, He is superior. You have to accept. It is not that it is not existing. It is existing. So as you are trying to do something, somebody has already done it. Then what is your credit?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> On the one hand, they say that the creation was a chance, accident, and on the other hand, they're trying to find the law of nature. So this is a contradiction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. And the law. Just see. And law, law, nature is not giving him chance. And he's depending on chance theory. He's so unfortunate rascal that he does not get even the chance. So discuss these things in different ways and issue a small pamphlet in Russian language. Or any language. Doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, in Russian!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They're the greatest atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, that would be.... A dialectic spiritualism pamphlet in Russian. That's big. Russian. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The land is very nice. All flat, flat land. Hundreds of miles.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> It is all tobacco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> All tobacco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just see. They're misusing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> You can smell it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian:</span> Smell tobacco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, that's why it is. Tobacco. I always thought someone was smoking <span class="Italic">bidis</span> right downstairs, or something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> ...smell tobacco.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Virginia smells like this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Virginia, in America. There, all they do is grow tobacco now. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> .... But on the other hand, they claim that there are certain laws which govern this material nature. This is a complete contradictory position.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hariśauri:</span> A law means there has to be some compliance to a higher authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So discuss all these nonsense propositions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Somebody...? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has clearly proved that Darwin is a fool. He's wrong. He has not written the word "fool," but he's wrong. (end)</div>
