<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. You don't find any dictionary. It is not old.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It is like <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Like <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa,</span> yes. You are very intelligent. (laughs) It is another manufacturing, <span class="Italic">daridra.</span> <span class="Italic">Janārdana... Janatai</span> is not Janārdana. We say <span class="Italic">jaysam pakṣe janārdana. Jaysam pakṣe janārdana.</span>(?) "All glories to the party who side Janārdana is there." <span class="Italic">Jaysam pakṣe janārdana.</span>(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Pakṣe, pakṣe janārdana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pāṇḍu-putrāṇāṁ jaysam pakṣe janārdana. Pāṇḍu-putra,</span> the Pāṇḍavas, are glorified because on their side, Kṛṣṇa is there. Therefore, victory for them. One very big doctor of Allahabad, my old friend, Dr. G. Bose, he is also D.T.M., M.A.B. He wants to join this movement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol.</span> There is one doctor, he'll look to the health and hygiene of the inmates.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...on that point I'm going to (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These rascals, <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> they do not know what is the goal of life. But in which way we should direct? These rascals, they do not know. Still, they become public leaders, <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> <span class="Italic">Na viduḥ.</span> How to dissuade people to stop this? Just like we are doing: no illicit sex. <span class="Italic">Nivṛtti. Nivṛtti. </span>No illicit sex, no intoxication, no gambling, no meat-eating. This is <span class="Italic">nivṛtti.</span> And <span class="Italic">pravṛtti,</span> take to Kṛṣṇa. This is <span class="Italic">pravṛtti, nivṛtti. </span>But the rascal demons, leaders, they do not know these things. <span class="Italic">Pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca na viduḥ asura-jana</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> They do not know it. Still, they become leaders. They do not know in which way people should be directed, and still they claim to be public leaders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Na ācāro na satyaṁ te śuddha vidyate.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Na ācāraḥ.</span> Personally they also do not do anything, ah? They're addict, they addict to drinking, addict to prostitution, and they, by votes, they become leaders. So how people will be happy? <span class="Italic">Asura-jana.</span> They live by <span class="Italic">asura-jana.</span> This is the whole chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> They, they are making their plan. What is their plan-making? <span class="Italic">Idam adya mayā labdham imaṁ prāpsye manoratham.</span> This is the only plan. "Now I have got this bank balance, and tomorrow further increase, and tomorrow increase." Increase, increase, his life decreased, and kicked out of this...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That plan becomes out of date next year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah? (laughs) Yes. That "He's my enemy, he's my friend. I'll kill so many enemies. Now one enemy is still there... Who is richer than me? Who is wiser than me?" These are the plans of the <span class="Italic">asura-jana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Sanskrit) <span class="Italic">Sadṛśo māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Sadṛśo mayā. </span>Yes. "I'll protect my money in this way. I shall keep money in this way so that my sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons will enjoy. And I am going to become a cat and dog, doesn't matter. (everyone laughs) My grandson will enjoy." These are the plans. Where this rascal is going, he has no information. He has no information where he is going, but he is making provisions for his great-grandson. He does not know who is coming to be his great-grandson. This is <span class="Italic">asura</span> program. You ask these <span class="Italic">asuras</span> that "If you do not believe in the next life, then why you are working so hard?" They reply, "For the next generation." Next generation. And if you do not believe in the next life, what is the meaning of next generation? They say like that. This is the asuric civilization. (Sanskrit) So...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Āsurīm...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Punar janmani.</span> They'll never be able to understand what is Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bhagavān mate.</span> They'll never be able to understand. And remain in darkness, and transmigrate from one body to another, and this business will go on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But then how will they come up?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When they <span class="Italic">tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> When they come to the stage to understand things by surrendering. But they will never surrender. That is their business. Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But the Lord uses a heavy stick, then they'll surrender.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are surrendered. They are being kicked by <span class="Italic">māyā</span> at every moment, but because they are fools, they say "I'm not surrendered." This is... In Bengali is called <span class="Italic">vihvala.</span> <span class="Italic">Vihvala.(?)</span> No, no... Shameless. He's being kicked every moment, but he's so shameless, that he's declared, "I'm independent, I'm independent." Shameless. (Bengali)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Just like these dogs around us...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. This is the position of the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> This is the characteristic of the <span class="Italic">asura.</span> They are under stringent laws of nature, being kicked every moment, and still is declaring, "There is no God, I'm independent. I'm independent." Every moment he's dying, and still he thinks, "I shall live forever." This is <span class="Italic">asura.</span> <span class="Italic">Pravṛttiṁ ca, nivṛttiṁ ca</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Bg. </i>16.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this is required. <span class="Italic">Pravṛtti</span> and <span class="Italic">nivṛtti,</span> to know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> What is <span class="Italic">pravṛtti?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Pravṛtti</span> means inclination for doing something. That is called <span class="Italic">pravṛtti.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Nivṛtti</span> means...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nivṛtti</span> means to stop. <span class="Italic">Pravṛttir eṣā bhūtānāṁ nivṛttis tu mahā-phalām. </span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> <span class="Italic">Nivṛtti...?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Nivṛttis tu mahā-phalām.</span> Here, at the present moment... Not at the present moment, always in the material world, the desire is that "I shall become the greatest enjoyer. I shall become king, I shall become minister... And at last I shall become God." (laughter) You see? So this the false <span class="Italic">pravṛtti.</span> And one who can cut down this rascal propensity, he's successful. But I'm neither king, neither a minister, neither I'm going to become God. I'm a tiny living entity, being kicked by the <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> like football. When he comes to this understanding, he is in knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But he is so shameless than in spite of being kicked like that, always, he's thinking, "I'm God, I'm independent, I can do anything," like that. This is <span class="Italic">asura. Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> <span class="Italic">Āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span></div>
<div class="Verse">na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prapadyante narādhamāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>māyayāpahṛta-jñānā<br class="calibre2"/>āsuraṁ bhāvam āśritāḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.15]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Because they've taken to this asuric principle, they do not surrender. This is the disease, material disease. Here is Kṛṣṇa, the perfect leader, and they're going this side, that leader, that leader, that leader. Why? The perfect leader is there, His instruction is there, in all fields of life, any field of life. And ultimately spiritual realization. But they will not take it. They'll not take. Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] Where is your book? You can read.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Oh, he forgot, and I brought another book. I brought that <span class="Italic">Siksha-vadri.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> There is the name of Kṛṣṇa in every page. I told you the other day. It's a quota <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> for all Vaiṣṇavas.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Read something.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I'll read the beginning, and then from the middle. (reads <span class="Italic">ślokas</span>) That is the beginning, and how it goes, then...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why did that person say that Janardan Swami Narayan is the topmost?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that Buddhism. That is not Vaiṣṇavism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> (indistinct) stop them, what he said, (Sanskrit).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Buddhism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But he's not Buddhist, he's Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he's taking the Buddhist philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He's not taking the Buddhist philosophy. In what way he has?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes, because in the <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> it is stated that, sometimes it is recommended animal sacrifice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He did not want to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, he says, even if he stated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Should not take it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that means he's denying the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He's denying the authority of Vaiṣṇava...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, Vaiṣṇava does not say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> He denied the authority of Buddhist, and not <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> see what he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, you read it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Na vaksyam sarva-tamasaṁ yajña-śiṣṭam abhipacchet.(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah! Even it is <span class="Italic">yajña-śiṣṭam...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Then also you should not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> You should not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That is what it says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is means denying the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas. Vedas</span> say you can eat meat after <span class="Italic">yajña.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But he says no, you should not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But therefore he's denying the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> You should, you should not eat meat even <span class="Italic">Veda</span> says.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, therefore he's denying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> Yes, but doesn't matter. I don't want to eat meat even the way... Even if you sacrifice a goat here and offer...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Na caiva...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...deny the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Vedas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You may not eat, that is a different thing. But the Vedic authority... Just like, suppose the law says, "This man should be hanged." If you say, "No, even if he is criminal, he should not be hanged," that means denying the authority of law. You cannot say this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> That's right. All right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> So you must eat their meat if it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no... You should not eat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> That is what he says...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's... You see? He does not know what is the scheme of <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>. You cannot stop meat-eating all of a sudden. But you can raise some restriction. These rascals who are meat-eaters, if you say, "Don't eat meat," he'll never do that. Therefore, "Yes, you can eat meat, just after offering to the goddess Kālī," and in this way, that means, once in the month, that means restricted. Restricted. So, <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> means they're taking gradually, not that, like a foolish, "You don't do this." You cannot do that. That is Vedic authority. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are meant for everyone. Those who are meat-eaters, you cannot stop them all of a sudden. Similarly, drunkards. You cannot stop them, drunkards, "Don't drink." They'll not hear you. Therefore restriction. "Yes, you can drink, after offering to the <span class="Italic">devī,</span>" and that means restriction. So what is the meaning of marriage? Because sex like the cats and dogs, stop it. Just get married. In this way, otherwise, you may say "No marriage." Just like, the other day these <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> come, because saw woman was sitting, they'll not enter. But I saw their teeth was so unclean, and the dress was never washed. But they have got this restriction, no seeing of woman.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> (Sanskrit)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You cannot deny the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Suppose you are following <span class="Italic">ahiṁsā,</span> you cannot say that "State should not anymore hang anybody." That you cannot say. You follow.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> Shall I read it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Vabhicaro na kartavyaḥ pumvi stri...(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, my point is that Buddhism was rejected from India because he's decried the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> So this fellow also will be rejected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That... Yes, immediately. Because he does not accept the authority of <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> That is real knowledge. <span class="Italic">Nindasi yajña-vidher ahaha śruti-jātam</span> Yes, <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> I mean to say, criticize the <span class="Italic">yajña-vidhi. Yajña-vidhi y</span>ou cannot criticize. <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo 'nyatra loko 'yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]. Karma-bandhana.</span> So <span class="Italic">yajña</span> must go on, and the <span class="Italic">vidhi </span>must be followed. That is real acceptance of Vedic knowledge. If you manufacture your own concoction, "This is good, this is bad," that will not help you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> <span class="Italic">Vetas pi pavitranam svadhinam ca tasam api, vedanam ca na kartavyam nindha saddhya...(?)</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But why he's making <span class="Italic">nindā?</span> You don't eat, even it is... Now in the first you said, you don't..., you cannot kill animal, even if it is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> I, I follow even though you said that you kill it for the sake of <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> I am not going to kill it, that's all. That is my personal...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. That you can do. But you cannot decry the Vedic laws.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> This is not decrying the Vedic law...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes... You said, <span class="Italic">api,</span> even if it is enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Vedas...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> I don't think so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not? It is clear, it is clear. You don't think, but the writing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> The writing...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Writing is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> The writing can be interpreted in a lot of ways.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no, no! You can interpret. No, no, no, no. We are not interpreting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (3):</span> We are not going to take that way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We cannot... As soon as you say <span class="Italic">api,</span> even if it is enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> don't do it. That means decrying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span>. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> You want us to eat meat by saying that the Vaiṣṇavas..., we won't do it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The Vaiṣṇava is forbidden.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> But then, this is a Vaiṣṇava way, forbidden to eat the meat.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But therefore you cannot decry the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> But this is not <span class="Italic">Veda,</span> you see? If you kill an animal and sacrifice in the way of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Vedic injunction. Sacrifice is done...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> This is <span class="Italic">tantra,</span> not <span class="Italic">Veda. Vedas</span> don't want. And there used to be animal living again after killing it...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> Are you able to do it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> So this is <span class="Italic">tantra.</span> He wants to decry the <span class="Italic">tantra,</span> not <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (4):</span> By <span class="Italic">tantra</span> they're verily killing animals to eat them away for the pleasure of their teeth, for the pleasure of the tongue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Tantra, tantra...</span> I do not know what kind of <span class="Italic">tantra...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...does not believe in killing animal and eating it even... <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say you can eat, I will not. And I don't mind decrying the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> that way, if you say so, sir. (indistinct) Vaiṣṇava, I don't think I can allow anyone to be killed. I'm very sorry to say this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> say "Kill," I won't. I won't, don't want that.</div>
