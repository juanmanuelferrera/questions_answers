<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is this meaning?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> They say that's just a figure of speech.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A figure of speech. Not meant to be literal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everything is theory. No practical. [break] ...ten direction. Eight direction, corner, and northeast, east-west, and up and down. So everywhere He is present. So Kṛṣṇa has got ten hands. So my father used to say, "When Kṛṣṇa takes your money or possession in ten hands, how you can protect it with two hands? And when He give you in ten hands, how much you can take in two hands?" (laughs) So in my case it has become practical. Everything He has taken in ten hands, and now He is giving in ten hands. (laughter) I am practically experiencing. My Guru Mahārāja ordered me, "You do this." I was trying to save my business, my family, with two hands, and Kṛṣṇa took it in ten hands. And now, after making me beggar, He is giving me, ten hands: "You take as much as you like." Now I am thinking of my father's instruction. [break] ...ambition was that I become a great de... <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> That was his... He used to invite so many saintly persons, and he would pray, "Please bless my son"-I was very pet son-"that he may become a devotee of Rādhārāṇī. Rādhārāṇī may bless him." That was his only prayer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Fulfilled.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He was inviting so many saintly persons. That is the old system, to receive saintly person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said that you were not so much impressed by the saintly persons that were coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Why was that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not all of them were real Vaiṣṇava. That was my discrimination from the beginning of my life. I never liked these bogus swamis and yogis. I never liked. But my father had no discrimination. "Never mind whatever he is. He is a saintly person. Receive him." He was giving fortnightly... There was one Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> in Kālīghāṭa. So first of all the father was <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> Then his son was <span class="Italic">sannyāsī.</span> So we had very good relationship with him. I also used to... Because father was going... So he would carry <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> for him-in those days <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> was very cheap-so much <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> and so much butter. Whenever he would visit, he'd give some red cloth, <span class="Italic">gāñjā,</span> and butter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Your father would give him <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That, to <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, he was smoking <span class="Italic">gāñjā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But why did he supply him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He did not discriminate that this is bad. He smokes, and he had some regard for him. "All right, take <span class="Italic">gāñjā.</span>" (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So Kṛṣṇa is also like that if we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was offering him something, "Whatever he likes." That was his theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Friendly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. "It doesn't matter." He did not know the <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> smoking was bad for <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> That is impression in India. We criticize, but in India, in every <span class="Italic">sādhu samāj </span>they smoke <span class="Italic">gāñjā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Still?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Not high class. These bogus swamis and yogis. They...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, that Mr. Das, the lawyer who came here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I used to visit him, and he had one <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> who used to come who was his guru, and he would also smoke <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Gāñjā</span> smoking is not taken as bad in India, by the <span class="Italic">sādhus,</span> not ordinary men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. He told me, Mr. Das, that it increased his meditation and ecstasy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be, <span class="Italic">gāñjā</span> smoking by the <span class="Italic">sādhus, sannyāsīs,</span> is not taken very bad serious. The hippies learned from them. Allen Ginsberg introduced... "Yes. <span class="Italic">Gāñjā</span> smoking is very good by the saintly person."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I think your Guru Mahārāja spoke strongly against such persons.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. And from him we learned that intoxication, any kind of intoxication, is bad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura also was...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He was also not very serious, but Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was very serious, and we learned from him. No, it is <span class="Italic">śāstrīya.</span> No intoxication is good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> How is it that Bhaktivinoda Ṭhākura was not so strict in that regard, yet his son, who learned from him, became very strict, like a rod?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (chuckles) Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Ṭhākura was so strict (laughs) that because he married twice, he used to say, "<span class="Italic">strī-saṅgī, </span>attached to woman," even his father. (laughter) He was very strict. Sometimes when he would be angry, he'd, "You <span class="Italic">strī-saṅgī.</span>" And don't discuss this thing. (laughs) He was very strict. No excuse, no compromise.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's where you got all of that from.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My is imitation, but his was real. (laughs) All these Navadvīpa people were afraid of him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Afraid.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Strong-hearted. They made a, what is called, conspiracy to kill him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Who did this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, the Navadvīpa <span class="Italic">gosvāmīs.</span> They raised 25,000 rupees and wanted to bribe this police officer that "You take this money. We shall finish him. Don't take any action."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the policeman said?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Refused. "Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "He's a saintly person. We cannot agree to that." Everyone knows police takes bribe. They admit, "Yes, we take bribe, but not in such cases." This was told by Guru Mahārāja, Bhaktisi..., to me. He was talking many things confidential.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, what is that story that one time Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī was invited to... He wanted to get invitation or he was invited to speak and they put so many conditions on his speaking. It was some place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They said, "Now you cannot speak on such and such subject." He agreed, "All right."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I think there was a Vaiṣṇava meeting inaugurated by Mahārāja Maṇīndrānandī. You are referring to that. [break] When I was visiting, I used to sit on his couch. Yes, like... Guru Mahārāja was sitting on the couch, so I took him as ordinary gentleman. So then nobody asked me that, that "You are sitting? Get down." No. Nobody asked me. Then I was seeing that all other big, big disciples, they are sitting down. So then I began to sit down. Neither Guru Mahārāja told me, neither anybody told me.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What kind of a... It was a regular couch...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> ...or a <span class="Italic">cauki</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Not <span class="Italic">cauki,</span> couch. That padded couch, bench.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Sofa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sofa, sofa, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, boy. You were a young man at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But no one said anything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not very young. It was in 19... Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> 1923?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. '23, of course, when I first met him, he was sitting ground. I was also. At Mathurā there was party, <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> party, in 1933. So I went to see that party, what they are doing, Gauḍīya Maṭha, out of inquisitiveness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It was at that time.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm hm.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You mentioned once that most of the <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> devotees, they wanted to go on <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> but he was speaking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So I did not go to <span class="Italic">parikrama,</span> so he very much appreciated. There was announcement that "Now <span class="Italic">parikrama</span> will start in the evening at five, and Prabhupāda also will speak. So anyone who wants to hear Prabhupāda, he can stay. Otherwise be ready for going." So about a dozen men remained, and all went to <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> So I was at that time new man-not exactly new man, but not recognized disciple. I did not go. So he saw that I am sitting, I did not go to <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> He very much appreciated. I preferred to hear him than go to <span class="Italic">parikrama.</span> That he appreciated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That was the same time that you took initiation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. After that, I took initiation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Where was the initiation ceremony?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> In Allahabad.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> 1933.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So from Mathurā everyone went to Allahabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, or they went to somewhere. But I came back. From Allahabad I went to Mathurā, and I came back to Allahabad at my own place.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Initiation was held at that Gauḍīya Maṭha in Allahabad?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hah. At that time that Gauḍīya Maṭha also not there. That is at a rented house.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you help to build that one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Did you help to establish that Gauḍīya Maṭha?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, majority was paid by one of my Godbrothers, that three thousand, purchasing land. Then gradually developed. We used to pay something. [break] ...before to here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Oh, yeah. He has come many times, Tarun Babu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He came many times? (end)</div>
