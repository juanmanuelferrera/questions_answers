<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You understand what is the meaning of <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata,</span> this word, <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata?</span> You understand? These are the common questions. If you do not understand this common question then how you can instruct others?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right but do not take the position of a teacher unless you have assimilated the whole thing. Simply by hearing others you may misunderstand, you may not present the real thing. Therefore I'm asking you...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (Hindi) (indistinct) but you must know. Another thing is that you must know <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> from a <span class="Italic">bhāgavata,</span> whose life is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> First of all you must know what is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> What is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata?</span> Can you give me idea what you have understood? Instead of going through the instruction, first of all let me understand what do you understand about this (indistinct) <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> That is essential. So you cannot explain what is <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> You have read <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> from the beginning? <span class="Italic">Dharma projjhita kaitavo atra.</span> You have read?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? You have not read even the first verse and you are going to give instruction on <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam?</span> Your life should be <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> You should understand what is <span class="Italic">bhāgavata.</span> Simply by (indistinct) words from others how can you accept?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? So I bless(?) you that you try to understand. Then you write. That is my request. (end)</div>
