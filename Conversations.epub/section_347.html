<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> January 9, 1974. Los Angeles. Morning walk. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...origin of everything, animate or inanimate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Your lecture this morning was brilliant, Śrīla Prabhupāda. Your logic could defeat anybody. (Prabhupāda chuckles) The theological rascals, though, they will not accept any authority except their own mind. They are such nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is called <span class="Italic">mano-dharmī.</span> In Sanskrit it is called <span class="Italic">mano-dharmī,</span> mental speculators.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> It's a disease, actually.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And therefore, mental speculators, they have been condemned. <span class="Italic">Manorathenāsati dhāvato bahiḥ [SB </span>5.18.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because they carry on, or they are carried by the chariot of mind, <span class="Italic">manorathena. Manorathena asati. Manoratha,</span> when you drive on the chariot of mind, you cannot get any fixed idea. Because mind is flickering. <span class="Italic">Saṅkalpa-vikalpa.</span> Mind's business is "Accept this, and again reject it." So all these speculators are doing. Somebody is putting forward some theory, and after some years he will himself reject or somebody else will reject. So <span class="Italic">manorathena,</span> by mental speculation, you remain on the material platform. You cannot get any spiritual idea. Therefore <span class="Italic">harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> Anyone who is not in the spiritual platform... Spiritual platform means to be a devotee of the Lord. The <span class="Italic">Māyāvādīs,</span> because they are not devotees of the Lord, they are not on the spiritual platform. They are on the material platform. They are speculating, spirit-"something negation of matter." That's all. That is mental speculation. It is bad. "Good means negation of bad." They are thinking like that. They do not know, in this material world, bad and good are both the same thing. Because it is matter. That they do not know. They think, "This is bad, this is good." But they do not know, materially conceived anything, good or bad, they are the same thing. That they do not know.</div>
<div class="Verse">dvaite bhadrābhadra-jñāna, saba-manodharma<br class="calibre2"/>ei bhāla, ei manda-ei saba bhrama</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><span class="Italic">Dvaite</span> means this external energy of Kṛṣṇa. There everything is infected.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> How is bad and good the same thing, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Just like we are walking on this street. Sometimes we say, "This is very good." And sometimes, "It is very bad." But the street is the same. So how it is good and bad? This is simply mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Sense perception?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Mental speculation. When it is dry... So dryness also, sometimes it is, "Oh, it is very dry, bad." And again, say dry, we shall say, "Oh, today is very good." It is simply mental speculation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> It is like wet stool and dry stool. It is still stool.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? Yes. (Chuckles) Yes, that is the example. The dry part of the stool, they say, "Oh, this part is very nice." He forgets that, after all, it is stool. So what is the dry or moist? Just like they are making scientific advancement. But the death is there. So what is the use of your advancement or no advancement? One who has not advanced in science, he'll also die. And you'll also die, advanced. Then what is the good? You cannot protect yourself from death. Then what is the meaning of this "good"? "This is good. This is advancement, and this is not advancement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the distinction, the good and bad...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is your distinction. You have made such distinction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I think that depends on the consciousness of the individual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relativity, relativity, law of Relativity. What is, what is food for one is death for other, the same thing. So how you can say the food is good or bad? Is it not? "One man's food, another man's poison." So how you can distinguish this is food or poison? One man will say, "No, it is food." Another man will say, "It is poison." So how you'll distinguish? So this good and bad is simply mental speculation. Because it is in the material platform, there is nothing good. Everything is bad. Otherwise why Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> In the name of <span class="Italic">"dharma,</span>" so many rascaldom is going on. Therefore Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya.</span> It is not <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> And <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra: [SB </span>1.1.2] "This cheating type of religious system is rejected from <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span>" All so-called religions, they're simply cheating. Cheating. <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">Kaitavaḥ</span> means cheating. Everything is cheating. They say, "We are advancing." What you are advancing? The problem, birth-death, is there. So what is the meaning of your advancement? <span class="Italic">Dharmaḥ projjhita-kaitavo 'tra paramo nirmatsarāṇām [SB </span>1.1.2]<span class="Italic">.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> This is the only means, then, to get off that <span class="Italic">manorathena.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Manorathena,</span> yes. <span class="Italic">Manorathena</span> means if you remain on that platform, then you have to reject again. Just they are doing, the so-called scientists, philosophers. They are putting forward some theory, and after some time they reject it. So if you remain on the mental platform, then this business of accepting and rejecting will go on. You'll never come to a conclusion. Therefore one has to rise to the spiritual platform. That is <span class="Italic">nityaḥ śāśvato 'yam, na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is eternal, everlasting.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> Not a theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They just constantly speculate on the material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> They speculate on the material nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> And they can never be spiritual.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Umāpati:</span> Just always material.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Number of zeroes never make one. It is zero. You add thousands of zeroes, one after another, the value will be zero. Not one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But there is a theory, Śrīla Prabhupāda... Not theory. It's a fact, that if some number is raised to the power zero, that becomes one. In mathematics.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. But I am speaking that you combine millions of zeroes. That will never become one. That I am speaking. Zero is zero. Zero plus zero equal to zero. Zero minus zero equal to zero. Zero multiplied zero, zero. Zero divided by zero, zero. That's all. Where you get...? And by the side of zero, if you bring one, <span class="Italic">eko brahma,</span> immediately it will become ten. And add another zero, immediately hundred, ten times increased. That one must be there, one God. Then zero increases value. Similarly, this material world is zero, but if there is Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then it is valuable. Then it is valuable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> But that <span class="Italic">manorathena,</span> the chariot of the mind, that is never valuable.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it has no value.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prajāpati:</span> The whole western...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Manorathena asati dhāvato bahiḥ.</span> By mental speculation, you will remain on this <span class="Italic">asati,</span> in this temporary field. <span class="Italic">Asat</span> means "which will not exist." Anything in this material world, you take, that will not exist. Anywhere man can say. The skyscraper building is constructed, but everyone knows that it will not exist. Some day it will fall down. Everyone knows. It will never exist. That is explained by Kṛṣṇa in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that "If you think that by combination of matter, life has come, so life was not there before the combination. And this combination will dismantle. So life, there will be no more life. So why these three period you are lamenting? There is life." Because according to this theory-"The combination of matter makes life"-so before combination there was no life, and the combination dismantled, there is no life. So beginning and end no life. Why you are lamenting in the middle? Very good reasoning. Just see. Therefore Prahlāda Mahārāja says, <span class="Italic">māyā-sukhāya bharam udvahato vimūḍhān [SB </span>7.9.43]<span class="Italic">. Māyā-sukhāya,</span> that illusory, illusory happiness. <span class="Italic">Māyā-sukhāya.</span> And for that reason, they are making huge, gorgeous arrangement and working day and night, which will be zero. It has begun from zero and it will end into zero. In the middle they are busy. Just see. Therefore <span class="Italic">vimūḍhān.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> In your books you say that the world is like a dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> How is it a dream?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Dream, just like last night you had some dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, it has no value. It is gone. And again, this night, when you'll sleep, you'll forget all these things. You'll dream. You don't remember during night, when you are dreaming, that "I have got my house, I have got my wife I have..." You all forget. So it is dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> It is true or is not true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Where is true? You forget at night. Do you remember when you sleep that you have got your wife and you are sleeping on bed? You have gone some three thousand miles away and seeing something else. Do you remember that you have got a place to reside?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this is dream at night. And night dream, what you saw at night, that is now dream. So both of them dream. You are simply visitor. That's all. You are seeing this dream and that dream. You are, you are fact, but what you are seeing, that is dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> But I have the impression that "This is true, and my dream is not true." What is the dif...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Everything is untrue. How it is true? If it is true, why you forget at night? Why you forget? If it is true. Do you remember at night?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> No, I don't remember.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? How it is true? As you don't remember the dreams which you saw last night..., That, therefore we say "dream." Similarly this thing, because you forget at night, this is also dream.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> But I have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is day-dream, that is night-dream. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Day-dream and night-dream. And the night-dream, then you perceive that as being real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> When you dream at night, then you think that is real.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That is real. You cry... It is dream, but you are crying, "There is tiger, tiger, tiger!" Where is tiger? But you are seeing it is fact, tiger. "I am being killed by a tiger." But where is tiger. [break] ...in dream you are embracing some beautiful girl. Where is that beautiful girl? But actually this is happening.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> Is it happening?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is happening because there is discharge of semina, night pollution. But where is that girl? Is it not dream? So similarly this is also dream. You are having the effect of truthfulness, but it is a dream. <span class="Italic">Māyā...</span> Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">māyā-sukhāya.</span> The same thing, that at night you are dreaming you are embracing nice beautiful girl, as there is no such thing, similarly, in the daytime also, whatever advancement you are making, this is also like that. <span class="Italic">Māyā-sukhāya.</span> We are happy, we are dreaming, "This process will make me happy. This process will make me happy." But the whole process is dream only. You are taking this day-dream as reality because the duration is long. At night, when you dream, the duration is for half an hour. And this is for twelve hours, or more than that. That is the difference. It is a twelve hours' dream, and that is half an hour dream. But actually, both of them are dream. And because it is twelve hours' dream, you are taking it as, accepting it as real. That is called illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. We are making distinction between animal and ourself, but we're forgetting, we are forgetting, the animal also will die and I will also die. So where is my advancement? Will you remain? You'll also die. So where is your advancement upon animals? That is stated in <span class="Italic">śāstra: āhāra-nidra-bhaya-maithunaṁ ca samānam etat paśubhir narāṇām.</span> Business-eating, sleeping, sex-life and defending-this is also animal's business. And you are also doing the same. How you are distinct from animal? You'll die. The animal will die. But if you say, "I'll die after one hundred years, and this ant will die after one hour," that does not mean that you are in reality. It is a question of time. Just like this huge universe. It will be all be destroyed. As your body will be destroyed, this will be destroyed, annihilation, dissolution. Nature's way, everything will be dissolved. So therefore it is dream. It is a long duration dream. That's all. Nothing else. But the advantage is that even in this dream you can realize the reality, God. That is the... So if you don't take advantage of this dream, then you are missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> So I am half asleep.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. This is the... Therefore <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> says, <span class="Italic">uttiṣṭhata.</span> "Get up, get up, get up!" <span class="Italic">Jāgṛta.</span> "Become awakened." <span class="Italic">Prāpya varaṁ nibodhata.</span> "Now you have got the opportunity. Utilize it." This is Vedic injunction. <span class="Italic">Uttiṣṭhata jāgṛta prāpya varaṁ nibodhata.</span> This is Vedic in... <span class="Italic">Tamasi mā jyotir gama.</span> These are Vedic injunctions. So we are preaching the same thing, that "Reality is here, Kṛṣṇa. Don't remain in this darkness. Come to this consciousness." That is our preaching. <span class="Italic">Tamasi mā jyotir gama.</span> [break] ...experienced the sunshine, bright day, and this gloomy day. So when you are in darkness, we must have to admit, "There is light." Because darkness means absence of light. So as we are in the darkness of this material existence, there must be something life of light. That is spiritual world. That is reality. [break] <span class="Italic">...ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> "Oh, I don't belong to this darkness, darkness atmosphere. I belong to the light atmosphere." That is self-realization. <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā<br class="calibre2"/>na śocati na kāṅkṣati<br class="calibre2"/>samaḥ sarveṣu bhūteṣu<br class="calibre2"/>mad-bhaktiṁ labhate parām<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>18.54]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">This is <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta [SB 4.30.20]</span> stage. Just like this is a <span class="Italic">cakra.</span> I am walking on this wheel. But I am thinking I am advancing. What is this advancement? It is already there. Just like they are advancing in science and they must remain here. They are trying for so many years to go to the Moon planet, and no result. (laughs) The same, same thing. "Now we are going to the moon planet." But coming again. That's all. So <span class="Italic">saṁsāra-cakra.</span> Just like the dog. Dog is sometimes barking: "Gata-gata-gata-gata!" The master says, "Come on." Immediately come. He thinks that "I have got freedom. Let me jump over." You see. So we are thinking like that. We are under the <span class="Italic">māyā's</span> clutches. "Come on, come on here." <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> He's under the reins of <span class="Italic">prakṛti.</span> He cannot go anywhere. (pause) [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> ...simultaneously in the dream and not in the dream. So when...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is reality, when you are chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> But I also see all this.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? That is another thing. On the path of reality, you come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hanumān:</span> On the path?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. It is a process. When the process is complete, then you'll come to the reality. But that is the process. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> We cannot distinguish now reality and non-reality because the heart is unclean. So we have to cleanse, and then we come to the reality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> For that matter, Śrīla Prabhupāda, when one comes to that stage, there is no difference between animate and inanimate. Is that true?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Highest stage?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Highest stage, everything animate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> Yes. So a stone... Even a stone has soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh yes, yes. Just like this tree. You cut; it does not protest. The consciousness is not developed. That is the... But it has got life. You scientists, you do not believe that stone has also life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> No, they say it's just matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> They say there's no life there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nitāi:</span> Every stone has life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, dead stone has no... But there are many mountains, they are increasing. You know, at Benares there is a stone? <span class="Italic">Tila-bandhesvara.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> I don't know.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That increases. If you go, see today, and go ten years after, you'll see-take the measurement-it has increased. They'll go...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But they will say that because of the position of the dust particles the size will increase. Even a small...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no. It is clean. There is no... It is being washed even. Its name is <span class="Italic">Tila-bandhesvara.</span> (?) So there is no uncleanliness. Still, the body increases. There is still <span class="Italic">Tila-bandhesvara.</span> (?) There is temple of <span class="Italic">Tila-bandhesvara.</span> People go to see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Svarūpa Dāmodara:</span> But the consciousness is covered there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Covered, yes. Dullness means consciousness is covered. You put a child in open air. He'll not feel much cold. You see practically. He'll not feel. Because consciousness is not developed. Animal, they will not feel cold. But we feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> But Prabhupāda, there are still such things as dead matter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not dead matter. The soul is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Suppose something, well, something like this shoe that I'm wearing...,</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is now dead matter. But when you go, the higher understanding, it is a composition of atoms. So we learn from Vedic <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> that within the atom there is life. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-sthaṁ govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi [Bs. </span>5.35]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is, there. If within the atom there is life, then what to speak of anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> That's a <span class="Italic">jīvātmā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. Govinda is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When Kṛṣṇa is there, then Kṛṣṇa is there with everything. Kṛṣṇa cannot be alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bahulāśva:</span> This is the real science, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Vijñāna. Yad vijñāna-samanvitam. Jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me yad vijñāna-samanvitam.</span> Is it not? <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ me...</span> "My knowledge is very confidential and it is full of science." <span class="Italic">Jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me yad vijñāna-samanvitam.</span> And in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there is said, "Knowing this knowledge..." <span class="Italic">Yaj jñātvā neha bhūyo 'nyaj jñātavyam avaśiṣyate.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">kasmin tu bhagavo vijñāte sarvam idaṁ vijñātaṁ bhavati.</span> So this is the way.
