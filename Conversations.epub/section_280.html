<div class="Heading">Room Conversation with Malcolm<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>July 18, 1973, London</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> ...as with the origin of all things.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So what is that origin of all things?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> You ask me something for which I have no words.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Our searching is... Not searching. We take the origin of everything, Kṛṣṇa. In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span> Call Paṇḍitjī. Find out the verse, <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate.</span> Just like in this orange there is water, (Prabhupāda is eating an orange) very nice, tasteful. How it generated? (pause, Pradyumna comes in, offers obeisances)</div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> "I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This, origin. So as a scientist, what is your opinion upon this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> It is not for me to speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> It is not for me to speak.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You don't speak?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He's a little humble. He...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you can take it from us, from the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> that God is the origin of everything. Earth, water, air... (Child crying.) (Aside:) Come on. He can eat?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Give him one. Take one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Orange.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Come on. Come on. Yes, yes, yes. Come on. Thank you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> He's the youngest one I've ever seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How old he is? One year?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> One year.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's nice. He has got teeth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mother:</span> A few.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Few. God is the source of everything. The vast water has come from the body of God. Just like from your body a little quantity of water comes out, perspiring. Does it not? So we are limited. So one ounce, two ounce, we can produce. But God is unlimited. He can produce by perspiration millions of oceans. This is our understanding. God is unlimited; we are limited. We are also producing so many things through our body. Similarly, God is unlimited. His body has got unlimited potency. So everything comes from the body of God. This is our simple understanding. God is the origin of everything.</div>
<div class="Verse">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo<br class="calibre2"/>mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate<br class="calibre2"/>iti matvā bhajante māṁ<br class="calibre2"/>budhā bhāva-samanvitāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>[Bg. 10.8]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">One who understands this philosophy, he becomes a devotee. <span class="Italic">Budha.</span> He's in full knowledge. This is from our tree? No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> No, Prabhupāda. They're very bitter still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> They're somewhat bitter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Ours are still green. Not yet ripened. In September they'll be ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> If you want, I can clean it and cut it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Just I am asking. Take. Come on. (pause) Another gentleman was to come here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Yeah, there's one man coming later.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Mukunda:</span> He's expected in about five minutes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Oh, at seven.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, I wanted to ask you that in your lectures you continually speak of the ten <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> that children should have.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is not possible. It is very difficult. One <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> that initiation <span class="Italic">saṁskāra,</span> and marriage <span class="Italic">saṁskāra</span>-two, three <span class="Italic">saṁskāras,</span> can be done, not the ten. It is not possible. Now the circumstances will not allow. It is very difficult.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> One thing that Malcolm and I were talking about before was that, he was lamenting that our educational system nowadays in the west, material education, practically spoils the child to understand spiritual life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why in the West? Everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> More in the West because the child is more constrained in his molding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. The whole defect is that we are missing the goal of life. Therefore we do not know how to conduct business with the goal of life. At the present moment, in every field, they are missing the goal of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> They seem oppressed by weight of number, that there are too many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, goal is one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No, people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, people do not know the goal. That is the defect of modern civilization. Not modern, that is the defect of material existence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> But a number of people over a certain size make a goal by the number of people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pradyumna:</span> When a number of people think in a certain way?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No. The number of people make the goal not of them, but of the number.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Mass. Mass opinion usually forms society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Not... No, not mass opinion. Not the, not the involvement of the people, but the number of the people.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The millions and trillions number...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> By unanimous opinion, by unanimous pursuit of some goal, that becomes the common goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Fashion. Fashion?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, therefore I say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No, no. Number... I know, I... That when a number of people become beyond a certain size, that in order for that size to maintain, there becomes a code of written law whose existence is to preserve the number, and it becomes the goal of the people, and it is the goal of number and not of the people. And the people I see...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The people are numberless. Therefore the goal should be numberless? People are numberless. We cannot count. It is not possible. Therefore the goal should be also numberless?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda has taught us that actually the amount of people in the world has nothing to do with the form of education. Simply the... For example, if everyone in the world was Kṛṣṇa conscious, then where would there be a question of overpopulation? Because there would be harmony throughout society because the center of the society would be Kṛṣṇa. But unfortunately, due to the overpopulation, we have so many different goals, different interests, and therefore there's continual clash. So there's nothing against overpopulation as long as people are raised in Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Is overpopulation, then, a more important problem?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Well, for example, even in animal society, there is more animals, there's more insects, there's more birds than human society. But there's no question... They have no starvation. They have no nuclear warfare. Because they live as they're, as Kṛṣṇa has meant them to be, as their <span class="Italic">karma</span> dictates. But in our situation we are meant to understand Kṛṣṇa. This, the goal of human life, is to use our developed consciousness to serve God. But unfortunately, since we misuse this for selfish motives, therefore we have descended lower than animals. Therefore we have not even the simple harmony that animal life has. Therefore we have mass warfare. Therefore we have greed, economic distress and pollution. All these things are caused simply because we have not used our human life for understanding Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I think what you are saying, in a sense, is that generally the people are innocent. They grow up... And the goals of life are forced upon them, sort of, and actually that is not, the real goal is still missing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> They would say, yes, that there is... The number is too many.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> The number of goals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No, the number of people to support a system of return.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Return to the real goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> To the real goal. They feel oppressed into supporting the number system because it's...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Due to a larger number of people, is it possible to return all these people to the real goal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. As there is medicine for certain disease, if, in that particular disease, the prescribed medicine is given, then the disease will be cured. Is it not? Medical science, they have discovered medicine for a certain type of disease. So if the diseased man takes that medicine, particular, then he'll be cured. Similarly, if people take what is the actual goal of life by philosophy and logic, then their goal of life will be one. He must agree to take it just like the diseased man must agree to take the medicine. Then he's cured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> If a man reaches his maturity of years and leaves a western school, and he has the words which say "Know thyself," may he reject his family ties?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, there is no question of rejecting or accepting to understand the goal of life. The goal of life is meant for everyone. Maybe a family man or without family. It doesn't matter. Just like eating. Eating is for everyone. It doesn't matter whether he's a family man or not family man. It is his essential. Similarly, the goal of life is also essential to know for everyone. It doesn't matter whether he's family man or not family man. It doesn't matter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Is the medicine in the seeking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Is the medicine in the seeking?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Some are seeking, but the medicine is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Is looking for the medicine part of the medicine?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. There is no necessity of looking for it. The medicine's already there, goal of life. So we have to take information from authorities, what is the goal of life. Just like this child. The child, he knows that "My father is goal of life," or "My mother is goal of life." He may walk all over the room, but he knows that "Ultimately, my father is goal." Similarly our goal of life is the Supreme Father. Now, if this child is taken away from this room, he'll cry. He'll not be able to express that he wants the goal of his life, his father and mother. He'll simply cry, missing. Similarly, our goal of life is the Supreme Father. But because we are missing, we are crying here, throughout the universe, throughout the creation. We are simply crying. This is called struggle for existence. But the real goal of life is...(Aside) There is fire. Don't allow him to go there. There is fire. (Noise of child in background) Now, he doesn't remain there; he comes to the mother, the goal of life. Similarly, we have got our goal of life, a supreme father. We are missing that. Simply one has to know that "This is our goal of life. We were searching in vain for so many other goals of life." <span class="Italic">Na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> The goal of life is the Supreme Lord Viṣṇu. <span class="Italic">Durāśayā ye bahir-artha-māninaḥ.</span> They have missed the goal of life on account of their propensity to become happy within this material world. And that is the missing point. He cannot be happy without reaching... The same example. This child cannot be happy without being in the association of the father. If this child is taken away and he's given nice food, he'll cry. He'll cry because the goal of life is missing. Similarly, we are missing the goal of life. Therefore we are not satisfied in any way in this material world. There(fore) <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span> says, <span class="Italic">na te viduḥ svārtha-gatiṁ hi viṣṇum [SB </span>7.5.31]<span class="Italic">.</span> This struggle for existence is going on because they do not know that the goal of life is God, Kṛṣṇa or Viṣṇu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> If the child is taken from the parents, he will cry, but he will stop.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> But he will stop when time is past.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again cry. Again cry.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> When a time in years pass, he will forget, and ...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That forgetfulness is forced. He's, he's not happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> If he would then, when he is a grown person, recapture or re-feel the link to his reason for being, he must go back in his experience or thought to the point at which he cried to feel again the feeling of being lost. Now, the Western youth seem to have been forced to accept their position, and the position that they have accepted gives them no freedom to go back and find the point at which they felt the experience of the thing they had lost. So in their minds they would say, "There is something missing. There is no God. But there is a God. Yet I must find him with my mind." And then they know through the search that it is only going back through their own years of experience to the point at which they had lost that they will find it. But for the Westerner it clashes with his total Western heritage, the thing imposed him upon by his senses which is that he may not isolate himself from his community in order to go back. And the young people cannot move because this point holds them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The young people, they are moving. They are coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There is no check. Because they are western boys, there is no check. Just like they're all Europeans, Americans. So how they are coming to Kṛṣṇa consciousness? It doesn't matter whether Western, Eastern. Natural propensity is the same, either in the East or in the West. So it doesn't matter. That is not impediment. Anywhere, the science is... Just like your physical science. It is as good as in the West as in the East. For the East, there cannot be a different physical science. The same science can be taught in the East and the West.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> And the same...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Any science does not depend on East and West understanding. Science is science.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No. I'm talking not of science, but of education which...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, education is different. Education may be wrong or right, but science is always the fact. "Two plus two equal to four,"-that is equally good in the East and West, not that in the western countries, two plus two will be five. So similarly, any scientific knowledge, it does not depend on East and West understanding. It is good for everywhere. Similarly, to understand the science of God, it does not depend on the Western culture or Eastern culture. One must be serious to understand. Then it is equally available. <span class="Italic">Ahaituky apratihatā.</span> These material impediments cannot check progress in the science of God, cannot. <span class="Italic">Apratihatā,</span> without any checking. That we are experiencing, that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is not checked anywhere. We have got branches all over the world. Any country, there is no language difficulty. Wherever we chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, they join, "Hare Kṛṣṇa." There is no checking. Even Africa, they are also chanting Hare Kṛṣṇa. Even the child will chant. They clap. You have seen that a small child is...? I think he..., about six months old. So there is no checking. For spiritual understanding there is no checking. The child, six months' old child, clapping, that means he's joining with the system. He's not sophisticated. He's new child, but automatically... So there is no checking. (pause)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> If the science is available to everyone without impediment, then there must be the proper teacher, isn't it? There must be a teacher of the science...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> ...where people learn. That has been a difficulty here. There's been no real teachers until...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, everyone gives his own opinion. Everyone will say... He'll not dare to say that he's speaking right, scientifically. He'll say, "It is my opinion." To avoid any difficulty, he'll say, "In my opinion it is this." I think he's speaking of that, (that) there are so many people, and they have got so many opinions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do we know, then, what is the real fact?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have to understand it from a real man who knows it. <span class="Italic">Upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ.</span> Find out that. <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā.</span> So we have to approach the real person who has seen. Then you'll get the right goal of life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Pradyumna:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti te jñānaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">"Just try to learn the truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him submissively and render service unto him. The self-realized soul can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the truth."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So we have to approach a person who has seen the truth. It is not difficult. Just like if you are suffering from some disease, you have to go to a doctor who knows how to treat. It is same thing, like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> How do we know he's a good doctor or not? By his credential or...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That also... Therefore it is called <span class="Italic">sādhu-śāstra-guru-vākya.</span> Three things there are for knowledge. <span class="Italic">Sādhu,</span> saintly person; <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> scripture; and guru. So one statement we have to corroborate with other statement. If you accept somebody as guru, then you have to corroborate it whether <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says that he is guru or any saintly person says that he is guru. This is the way. Similarly, when you take a scripture, you have to know it from the spiritual master, whether that is actually scripture, whether it is accepted by the saintly person. <span class="Italic">Sādhu.</span> Similarly <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> also, whether guru says, "Yes, he is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>" Whether <span class="Italic">śāstra</span> says, "Yes, he is <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>" There are three things, <span class="Italic">sādhu-śāstra-guru.</span> So to accept one, you have to take the opinion of the other two. Then you'll get the right way. Just like who is a guru? That is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstras. Śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham. Śāstra</span> says, <span class="Italic">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet: </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12] "One must approach a guru." Then the same question comes, "Who is guru?" That is also stated, <span class="Italic">śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham.</span> "He's well-versed in <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> knowledge of <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> and fully Kṛṣṇa conscious." He is guru. Just like how do you know that here is a medical practitioner? Before going for treatment, you find out. How do you find out?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Some friend, perhaps.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyway, you have to take information. Similarly, guru, according to <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> who is guru, he must be confirmed by <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> saintly person, by <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Then he's guru. <span class="Italic">Sadhu-śāstra, guru-vākya, tinete kariyā aikya.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> What's the difference between a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> and a guru? <span class="Italic">Sadhu</span> means authorities like Vyāsa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Guru... He must be a <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> It means the previous <span class="Italic">ācāryas.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> means <span class="Italic">titikṣavaḥ kāruṇikāḥ suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām, ajāta-śatravaḥ śāntāḥ sādhavaḥ sādhu-bhūṣaṇāḥ</span> [SB 3.25.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> Everything, there is definition, who is <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> who is guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...what is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Everything is there. You have to know it. What is <span class="Italic">avatāra.</span> That is my business, how to know. But there is, everything's there. What... Everyone can know it. <span class="Italic">Sādhavaḥ, sādhu.</span> Sum and substance of <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> means devotee. Just like in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">api cet sudurācāro bhajate mām ananya-bhāk, sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> "He's <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span>" Who? <span class="Italic">Ananya-bhāk:</span> "Without any diversion of attention, he's completely engaged in My devotional service... Even if he has got some minor defects, still, because he is completely surrendered and engaged in My service, he's <span class="Italic">sādhu." Sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ [Bg. </span>9.30]<span class="Italic">.</span> So this is the test of <span class="Italic">sādhu. Sādhu</span> means he must be a devotee. <span class="Italic">Sādhu</span> does not mean having saffron color and long beard and doing all nonsense. No. <span class="Italic">Sādhu</span> means... First test is that he is unflinching, without any deviation. <span class="Italic">Api cet sudurā..., bhajate mām ananya-bhāk. Ananya-bhāk</span> means he does not know anything except the service of the Lord. That is the qualification of <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> So similarly, in other places also, the definition of <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Sādhu</span> means <span class="Italic">titikṣavaḥ:</span> he's very tolerant because a <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> has to face so many opposing elements and sometimes very offensive, but he has to tolerate. <span class="Italic">Titikṣavaḥ.</span> At the same time, <span class="Italic">kāruṇikāḥ,</span> very merciful. The same man who is torturing him, torturing him, he is trying to convince him about Kṛṣṇa. That means very merciful. He's not rejecting. Although he's torturing him, but he's trying to convince him, Kṛṣṇa. Therefore <span class="Italic">kāruṇikāḥ.</span> And he is not friend of any particular society or man. <span class="Italic">Suhṛdaḥ sarva-dehinām.</span> He is well-wisher of all living entities. It doesn't matter whether he's Indian, American, or black and white. No, no conception. Or even human being or animal. He is kind to everyone, friend, well-wisher of everyone. <span class="Italic">Ajāta-śatravaḥ.</span> He does not create any enemies. Such... These are the qualifications of <span class="Italic">sādhu. Śāstra</span> means the transcendental literature, not ordinary writings. That is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> Just like <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is <span class="Italic">śāstra, Veda</span> is <span class="Italic">śāstra,</span> or <span class="Italic">Bible, śāstra.</span> Scripture means given by God or His authorized representative. That is <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span> So <span class="Italic">sādhu-śāstra-guru.</span> And guru means who is completely devotee of Kṛṣṇa without any material motives. This is <span class="Italic">sādhu-śāstra-guru. Anyābhilāṣitāśūnyaṁ jñāna-karmādy-anāvṛtam, ānukūlyena kṛṣṇānuśīlanam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">.</span> (baby crying in background)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is stated that, you were lecturing that, that unless one performs the proper <span class="Italic">saṁskāras</span> for the children, they will become degraded. They will not follow the regulative principles and such... They become unwanted population?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In material world we have got so many obligations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> For example, in devotee families, if we perform the proper principles in raising children...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, your, your, your function is very simple. You become Kṛṣṇa conscious, and train your children in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> But there's always a chance that they may not as well.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That chance is also to you also. <span class="Italic">Māyā</span> is always there. But our duty should be like that. You become Kṛṣṇa conscious and raise your children to that standard. (indistinct) Just like we are teaching in Dallas. There is nothing extraordinary. The children are there, they're learning how to read, how to write, at the same time rising early in the morning, attending <span class="Italic">maṅgala-ārātrika,</span> joining in the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana,</span> playing <span class="Italic">mṛdaṅga,</span> dancing, taking <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> (Aside:) That's all right. By such training, automatically they'll be Kṛṣṇa conscious. And then all your duties are complete. If you make him Kṛṣṇa conscious, then all your duty is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Can you make a child Kṛṣṇa conscious without believing yourself?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Can you make a child Kṛṣṇa conscious if you yourself don't believe in Kṛṣṇa consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If you do not believe, if the father does not believe? You mean to say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> If the father does not feel.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes well, everything is individual. Father is individual and child is individual. Just like Hiraṇyakaśipu.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> Can a father impose on a child, something which he does not believe himself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No Kṛṣṇa consciousness is transcendental position. Once one gets a little touch with Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then he'll make progress. Just like the wick in a firework. Firework, a big, what is called? (sic:) Pottatter?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Haṁsadūta:</span> Firecracker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Crack. The long wick, you just set fire: (makes sound:) tille, tille, tille, tille, tille, and when it comes: tung! (laughter) It is like that. You just set up the fire and then one day he'll become fully Kṛṣṇa conscious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So the knowledge is absolute, it works with anyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. Even if he does not complete, whatever he has done, that is complete. Because it is spiritual, it is not material. In material world suppose if you want to do something, you have to make the background. And while doing the background if you could not make further progress, everything is finished. But spiritual work is not like that. From the very beginning, whatever you are doing, that is asset. Nothing is lost. <span class="Italic">Svalpam apy asya dharmasya trāyate mahato bhayāt.</span> Even a little done in spiritual consciousness, that can save you from the greatest danger. (pause) Hare Kṛṣṇa. So you are going?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian guest:</span> It'll take me about two hours to reach there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I see, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> Do you have any questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Malcolm:</span> No, I may have questions to ask, but they're not very good questions.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> So the man has come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> No, <span class="Italic">prasādam</span> is ready.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> They're bringing <span class="Italic">prasādam?</span> Oh, that's nice.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So how such big men, minister, could accept such position of a mendicant and live...? Now, <span class="Italic">gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau...</span> So they got a better thing. They dipped into the ocean of the <span class="Italic">gopīs'</span> ecstasy. They were always thinking of the <span class="Italic">gopīs'</span> activities with Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Gopī-bhāva-rasāmṛtābdhi-laharī-kallola-magnau muhur, vande rūpa-sanātanau raghu-yugau śrī-jīva-gopālakau.</span> So unless one gets a better thing, he cannot give up the less important thing. So when, unless one gets that better thing-better humor, better mellow-they cannot give up these material engagements. Therefore, to get that better thing, it is advised that part of your hard labor you offer to Kṛṣṇa. This is called <span class="Italic">karma-yoga.</span> You remain in your <span class="Italic">karma,</span> but <span class="Italic">nirbandha, nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe,</span> be touched with Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement and spend at least fifty percent for Kṛṣṇa. Then, gradually, you come to the... Just like the Gosvāmīs came. So this is the policy. Otherwise, for Kṛṣṇa conscious men there is no need. Everything Kṛṣṇa will supply. Mādhavendra Purī installed a Deity. Now, for months, years together, only festival was going on. (pause) And another good example is that if somebody is in business and if he spends for Kṛṣṇa, that is a very good example for the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> Because everyone is not going to stop their <span class="Italic">karmī</span> mentality. So this will be an example, that "You are engaged in material. Now spend like this." That is another preaching. <span class="Italic">Loka-saṅgraha.</span> This is called <span class="Italic">loka-saṅgraha,</span> to collect ordinary men for Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Just like Janaka-rāja, he was a king, but great saintly person.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Lord Rāmacandra's father?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, father-in-law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Paramahaṁsa:</span> Father-in-law.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The great <span class="Italic">mahājanas,</span> out of the twelve, Janaka-rāja is one.</div>

Everyone can become <span class="Italic">mahājana</span> by his example of service to Kṛṣṇa. It doesn't matter. Caitanya Mahāprabhu also never said that a, one has to become <span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> No. He Himself was <span class="Italic">gṛhastha.</span> So there is no difficulty. <span class="Italic">Svayambhūr nāradaḥ śambhuḥ kapilaḥ kumāro manuḥ...</span> [SB 6.3.20].
