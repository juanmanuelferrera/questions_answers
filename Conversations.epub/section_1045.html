<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...one horse within the mouth-that is God. One hill. One Pūtanā, sucking the breast, her life goes. That is God. Why shall I take some cheap God? We are not so foolish. Here is the... So many great saintly persons hearing about God. <span class="Italic">Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ [SB </span>1.2.17]<span class="Italic">.</span> They are fools, hearing about Kṛṣṇa? Such great, great personalities? And Śukadeva Gosvāmī is speaking. Are they fools? All of them fools? One, two may be fool. They were wholesale fool? All the great personalities, they're all fools? Asita, Devala, Vyāsa, Nārada-all big personalities. Rāmānujācārya, Madhvācārya, Caitanya Mahāprabhu-they're all fools? I may be fool. They are not fools. <span class="Italic">Mahājano yena gataḥ sa panthāḥ</span> [Cc. Madhya 17.186]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why shall I accept a rascal God? <span class="Italic">Varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ</span> [SB 2.1.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> "Oh, you want to hear about Kṛṣṇa?" <span class="Italic">Varīyān eṣa te praśnaḥ.</span> Śukadeva was praising: "Oh, glorious, you have taken... Yes." Here is God. Breathing, and innumerable universes are coming. Here is God. Sleeping and breathing is not unnatural. He is also. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaḥ</span>-like us. But like not us. He can breathe and... That is the difference. Breathing is common. I breathe, He breathes. That's all right. But His breathing, my breathing is not the same breathing. He eats, I eat. That's all right. But when He eats, mother Yaśodā sees all the universes are within Him. They cannot understand this. That we are equal, that's all right, but there is difference. So far, I am a living being, He's also a living being, but He's supreme living being. How? Because I breathe, some dust comes and goes out, and when He breathes some universes come out. This is the difference. So because He is breathing and I am breathing, therefore equal. No. <span class="Italic">Paśyaty acakṣuḥ.</span> He sees, but not like us. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu bhārata.</span> He's seeing every particular thing, anywhere. <span class="Italic">Kṣetra-jñaṁ cāpi māṁ viddhi sarva-kṣetreṣu.</span> I can see within my limit, or I can feel pains and pleasure within my... But He knows everything, everywhere. <span class="Italic">Sarva-kṣetreṣu.</span> And because I cannot become like Him, therefore Māyāvādīs say <span class="Italic">kalpana,</span> "This is imagination." He wants to make God like himself, and he wants to become like God. Therefore all description about God he thinks imagination, <span class="Italic">kalpana. Kalpana.</span> Dr. Frog. Huh? More than this water, the...? How it is possible? Atlantic Ocean, very very big. What is that big? Maybe four feet, five, yes. Otherwise <span class="Italic">kalpana</span>. It it is not within his "feet" estimation, then he's <span class="Italic">kalpana,</span> imagination. This is their knowledge. (indistinct) I can think of three feet, four feet, five feet, ten feet, hundred feet-like that. And when I'm informed, "No, no, it is unlimited feet." Ah, this is <span class="Italic">kalpana.</span> This is going on. So what other news? I have to send one letter to the governor. [break] <span class="Italic">Sūtyām abhijāta-kovidāḥ. Yathā hi sūtyām abhijāta-kovidāḥ samādiśan vipra mahad-guṇas tathā.</span> Where this class of literature is now. <span class="Italic">Yathā sūtyām,</span> in the maternity home or maternity room, <span class="Italic">Sūtyām. Abhijāta-kovidāḥ.</span> The astrologers who can estimate the newly born child's destiny. Whatever they predicted, according to them, <span class="Italic">yathā hi sūtyām abhijāta-kovidāḥ samādiśan.</span> They said that "This child will be like this"-exactly he became. <span class="Italic">Parīkṣid dvija-varya-śikṣayā,</span> and being trained up by first-class <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> and the child came perfectly the king. Where is that king?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> There're no kings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that President? They're all drunkards, woman-hunters, meat-eaters. Exactly according to prediction, he became a young man and he was entrusted the kingdom, "Now you rule." (chants verse)</div>
<div class="Verse">tataḥ parīkṣid dvija-varya-śikṣayā<br class="calibre2"/>mahīṁ mahā-bhāgavataḥ śaśāsa ha<br class="calibre2"/>yathā hi sūtyām abhijāta-kovidāḥ<br class="calibre2"/>samādiśan vipra mahad-guṇas tathā</div>
<div class="After-Verse"> Each verse is a song. I wanted our students should do that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> To learn how to sing them nicely. To learn how to sing them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I can give them the tune. (chants first line of another verse) [break] <span class="Italic">...ghnantaṁ go-mithunaṁ padā.</span> This is Kali-yuga's king. <span class="Italic">Nṛpa-liṅga.</span> Dressed like king. <span class="Italic">Nṛpa-liṅga-dharam,</span> but <span class="Italic">śūdra. Nṛpa-liṅga-dharaṁ śūdraṁ ghnantaṁ go-mithunaṁ padā.</span> Very expert in cow-killing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> That's a very accurate prediction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Third-class, fourth-class men, dressed like President and king. Business: plunder money from the citizens and kill cow. 1965, 17 September, I landed at Boston.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> You've done a lot of things since then.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Changed the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Much water has gone down. (end)</div>
