<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Where you are sitting?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I am sitting here so that I might give my right ear to you all. I haven't seen you before.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Śyāmasundara:</span> I'm Śyāmasundara.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (indistinct)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, it is your seat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Very good, very nice seat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can take it, this seat.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The camera should have operated on your beautiful <i class="calibre3">sārī.</i> It's very good. Who is the chief of your group? You or he?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughter) As you like.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He holds a big stick, so I'm asking.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Prabhupāda is the chief. He has given me the stick.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Where is my negro friend? He has not come?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, he is not come. There was no place in the car. There were many negroes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> (aside:) Sit closer. You belong to this place? No. What place you belong to? (Hindi with other guest) It's a pretty long stick. Let me have a look at it first. It's wrapped in cloth. Oh, I see.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It is four bamboos.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> It is called <i class="calibre3">tri-daṇḍi</i>, <i class="calibre3">tridaṇḍi.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <i class="calibre3">Tridaṇḍa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <i class="calibre3">Tridaṇḍa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Are there three sticks in it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> No, there are three pieces-one, two, three. There is four sticks wrapped here.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You have taken <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa?</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Our Guru Maha..., Prabhupāda has given me <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> <i class="calibre3">Sannyāsa</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Then only you can hold it?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Madhudviṣa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes. Sit down, sit down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I will make the camera come after you(?) (laughter) Can you take a photograph?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Photo? No, you can't.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest (2):</span> I can't, no. (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Very well. I was told you were seventy-six.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You don't look like that. I think that's not correct age. Surely you are fifty-six. (laughter) How many of you here...? How many are you here...? Will you sit nearer here?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> I... This is your good ear?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. This is my good ear. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> I'll sit on the white bench.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you can sit on...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How many are you here in Madras?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> About fifteen are here in Madras now.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Fifteen or fifty?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Fifteen.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One-five.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> One-five.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How many are women and how many are men?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Two women and one child woman.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Three? The rest are boys? Young men.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> From seventy-six downward. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You belong to West Bengal?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Or East Bengal?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> My birthplace is in Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Calcutta.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Great and famous place. Looked after...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where you are governor also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Looked after very badly. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Lalaji was governor in West Bengal.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> How you have... Yes. I was called governor for some time there. I liked the place when I was there. They were all very kind. They had settled down after a lot of rioting and, and (indistinct), and all that, they had settled down.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> They were all very good to me. They looked upon me as a, an impartial man, which is a very great compliment in our country. Now you have undertaken a very great task. I am not competent to discuss or comment upon it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I think you are the best man to comment upon it.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> True. Still, I am not presumptuous enough to comment on one who has actually taken up the work. That is the difference between thinking and doing. Thinking is easy. Doing requires inspiration, and you have taken it up.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was thinking of taking up this task long, long ago. I wrote one letter to Mahatma Gandhi that "You have got influence all over the world, and you are acknowledged a man of spiritual understanding. Now you have got <i class="calibre3">svarāṭ</i>, you better retire and take up this preaching of <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> all over the world."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He was doing if from the beginning, not exclusively that, but applying the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> to everything that he was doing. He was doing it really, but you are referring to concentrated, exclusive...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...teaching of the doctrines and way life described in...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sometimes I requested Dr. Radhakrishnan also...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...when he was vice-president.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Radhakrishnan? Nowhere in comparison with Gandhi.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Radhakrishnan, highly intellectual, good man, but he was more of a... There was no inspiration he gave.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> God seems to have decided to spare him from that, from hard work.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> He was very happy, and he was very good and I love..., I have great love for him, and he was a very just man. He was a teacher of...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> In Calcutta he was a professor...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...politics, not of the <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i>.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Now, would you allow me to think aloud...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...in the matter you have taken up?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> First of all, they are scattered all over the world, your society. Scattered all over the world. They do not live together, anywhere.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I have got different centers.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You have.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. In different cities.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And they live together there?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. We have got devotees in each center, not less than twenty-five and up to two hundred.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I see. Oh, as big as that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Now, taking up my thoughts on the crude difficulties of management. First of all there is the very crude necessity of getting money to run these institutions.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And that means...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I may inform you, in this connection...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...that we are spending at the present moment seventy to eighty thousand dollars per month.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That's right. So whatever the exact amount may be, it's likely to be a big amount, and that means befriending people who will be prepared to part with the money...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hard-earned money.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...the money that they worship. Eh? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Money god is greater than Brahma and Śiva and Viṣṇu, just about, unfortunately. The people have made an idol of gold and silver and letter of paper, paper making the promises of government...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...which are never kept. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I was going to say, it is a fraud.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Fraud.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Māyā.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But that is...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is <i class="calibre3">māyā. </i>I give you piece of paper and you think on thousand rupees. This is <i class="calibre3">māyā.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. You see it depends on the credit to the man who gives the promise. Paper is mainly the document of credit. Governments have till now kept their credit, but now they have learned to disregard their promises also.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So that is one of the main troubles.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> But I think any religious movement like yours, people think they can buy up the grace of God by giving some money. Right? So you won't find any difficulty in getting money, because there is air of sin in the world, and the sinful people think they can compromise by giving money. Let them give.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is also good.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Let them give. That..., but that is the smallest point. Another point is, I suppose in each institution, in each center, there are men as well as woman...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> And they live together.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not together. Woman's section is different.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Women's section is different.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Different.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> It's very important...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...because all religious organizations have floundered on scandal, and you will have to be very careful about that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> This is what an old man has a right to tell you.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No, from the very beginning, because in Western country the boys and girls, they intermingle very freely.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Oh, yes, we know all that.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We know for a fact.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...and therefore I, as far as possible, I get them married.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. But that doesn't prevent permissive culture. It acts as a sort of guarantee (Prabhupāda laughs), as a sort of insurance against scandal. But scandals do come out.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and that is a...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So you are left with, that is another crude problem...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...that you have to take great care about. The traditional life of separate living is safer for organization. So all right to have men and are married and then in family they can mix. There is no difficulty. But when you start the separate organization, against which people are ready to manufacture stories, then you will have to be much more careful.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> So that is one comment I make as an old man.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. You are very valuable. Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That is a wise thing from an old man. That's one thing. Then these are minor matters. On the philosophy of action which you have taken...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...of converting the people to Sri Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Consciousness.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...to worship of Sri Kṛṣṇa...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...I wonder whether you will place more importance, I ask my friend, Mr.,...uh...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Girirāja.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...Girirāja, whether it is the <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> that you may stress on or the <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Gītā</i> is the preliminary study of <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> True, but in <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam</i> there is lots of danger, so far as Sri Kṛṣṇa goes. The <i class="calibre3">Bhāgavatam</i>, so far as it relates to the other incarnations of Mahā-Viṣṇu Himself, different, but so far as Sri Kṛṣṇa goes, it deals with a chapter of His life which can mislead people...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That we are very cautious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That we are very cautious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> You will have to be very cautious.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. I was discussing this point...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Generally, generally people begin to think, "I am Sri Kṛṣṇa..."</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah, that is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> "...God.'' That is what happens.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That will be danger. But so far as the Gītā Ācārya's teachings, He is a different person. There's no reference to early life in Vyāsa's <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā. </i>The <i class="calibre3">Bhagavad-gītā</i> is simply about an <i class="calibre3">ācārya. </i>Occasionally He says "I am <i class="calibre3">Īśvara,</i>" but He's an <i class="calibre3">ācārya</i> primarily. I need not..., I am not trying to sermonize to you. I'm trying to explain what I feel.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Very difficult doctrine of detachment. The <i class="calibre3">Gītā Ācārya</i> says <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i> is difficult, and you are likely to become a hypocrite if you, if you...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Mithyācāraḥ sa ucyate.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> ...if you prematurely take <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa. </i>Therefore try and compromise the principles of <i class="calibre3">sannyāsa</i>, that is to say of renunciation with worldly action, and, I mean, performance of duty, by performing the duties without caring for the results. That is the renunciation He has preached, I have understood.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> The defects are here that way which you will confirm, I have no doubt. But the question which I put to Girirāja was whether it would not have been better if you work from inside rather than make yourself a separate cult and organization. Separate organization, once you form, becomes like a person who is born. It gets his attachment, his ego, his everything. So the separate organization, like Mr. Banu, becomes an ego. He is fond of his own attachments, of his own interest, and so the organization must be looked after. The organization should succeed. The organization should succeed better than other organizations. There is (indistinct) among organizations. So all the egotistic weaknesses apply to organizations also. Therefore I was wondering whether it would not, if you had convinced that your mission was to spread the <i class="calibre3">Gītā Ācārya's</i> teachings as to how to act with detachment and with faith in the grace of God, where you go wrong, could not be having better done without making yourself separate.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. The thing is, when there is detachment, there must be another attachment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. To God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. But that is required.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is required. Just like...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes. Attachment to... There is a Tamil, Kurul. You have heard of the name Kurul? Tamil (indistinct), makes this point very clear.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> If you wish to live without detachment, attach yourself to God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> That will be the...</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <i class="calibre3">Paraṁ dṛṣṭvā nivartate<span class="Italic"></span></i> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 9.59]<i class="calibre3">.</i></div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> After getting good attachment, one gives up the inferior attachment.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Right. That will better right. The attachment should be to God.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Kṛṣṇa, Govinda, es I will call Him.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, yes.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> Attachment should be to Govinda, not to an organization.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. Govinda is absolute. Govinda and Govinda's organization the same. Govinda is absolute.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> I don't want to discuss it, I told you. I'm not competent to discuss. I'm just telling you what I think.</div>
<div class="Conversation"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. I'm also answering this point. Just like Kṛṣṇa, His name, His form, His pastimes, His entourage, they are all the same. Otherwise, what is the benefit of chanting Kṛṣṇa's name? Suppose I am thirsty just now. If I simply chant the name of water, "water,'' I'll not be satisfied. Water is required, actual substance. But when you chant "Kṛṣṇa,'' if Kṛṣṇa name is different from Kṛṣṇa, then you... (end)</div>
