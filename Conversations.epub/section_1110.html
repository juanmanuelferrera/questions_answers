<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> (reading letter) "Enclosed please find a clipping showing a press interview with California Governor Jerry Brown, who is a potential presidential candidate in the next election, asking the Hare Kṛṣṇa followers to help humanize conditions in the state mental institutes. He recognized that what is needed is for religious leaders to come in and to give these patients new life. And he recognized us as religious leaders. This is a great credit for us, and we immediately called the five biggest state institutes and got permission to visit their patients. We sent fifty devotees with gift-wrapped 'Krishnas' presents of <span class="Italic">prasāda,</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītās</span> and <span class="Italic">Kṛṣṇa</span> books, calendars, records, and so on.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I have been to Poona where there were some lectures on this Swami Sradhananda. It was fifty years past to his death. So there were some lectures.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Sraddhananda, they're <span class="Italic">Arya-samājis.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Arya-samājis</span> he was, follower of Swami Vivekananda. He was shot down in Delhi, and so... Forty years and there was some ceremony, all these things.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They think like this. (Hindi) So they'll end in the same way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> So how are we going to change?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> How? <span class="Italic">Mām anusmara yuddhya ca [</span>Bg. 8.7<span class="Italic">].</span> Taking the name, believing in full in the name of the Almighty. And we have to try our level best to uplift the society, to make them educate, to guide them, provide them, to bring them on the right path. This is only way.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Trivikrama:</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> says we need the guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, sir, that is right, no doubt. That is correct. So they should understand on where they wanted to go, what is their goal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no goal. They think after this body everything is finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Endless life they are returning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mūḍhā nābhijānāti mām eva param avyayam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> So we have to make them know that this is the wrong way, and this is the right way, and you have to go by this right way. And when you'll come to right way, he has to obey some discipline, obey some rules and rights. And there he wants <span class="Italic">nigraha.</span> [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Is it possible to stop it? Or young men, if he says "No, no, I'm not going to..." but everyone wants that. Young man does not want to become old man, but by nature's law he has to become.</div>

<div class="After-Verse">So the idea is that after losing our own culture, we have become set of fools. This is the real conclusion. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha. Na māṁ duṣkṛtino mūḍhāḥ prapadyante narādhamāḥ [Bg. </span>7.15]<span class="Italic">.</span> We have become so lowest of mankind and <span class="Italic">mūḍha</span> and full of sinful activities that we cannot understand what Kṛṣṇa says. This is real position. I am not speaking-Kṛṣṇa says. This is the sign. If one does not hear Kṛṣṇa, then he must be grouped in these categories: <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha, narādhama, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> What is the value of their so-called education if they cannot understand the simple truth, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">]</span>? What is the value of this education? Today I may be very big man, but I do not know that there is <span class="Italic">dehāntara.</span> And what kind of <span class="Italic">deha</span> I am going to get? Nobody has any knowledge, neither they're interested to cultivate. They have concluded that "After death, everything is finished." This is their education. Blind. Westerners, they say it frankly. That big, big professor, I have talked: "Swamiji, after death everything is finished." This is their conclusion. And our first education is that: <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> And they have given up everything. <span class="Italic">Kartāham iti manyate.</span> (Hindi) If you do not know the science, simply by false prestige you say "No, whatever I am thinking, it is all right." Are you free? You are completely under the laws of material nature. Why you are thinking foolishly? This is Indian culture. Even in the village, remotest village, you go and they will say, (Hindi) <span class="Italic">pūrva-janme...</span> (Hindi) They'll say. This is India's culture, <span class="Italic">pūrva-janma, paro-janma, dehāntara-prāptiḥ.</span> And you have lost your sense. What kind of education? What is the value of this education? Very precarious condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> One thing that these people have...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These people or that people, I don't mind.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Yes, sir. We have the secular India concept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Again why you are bringing "secular India"? This is a science. Science, science, scientific knowledge-so does it mean the secular India, they should stop scientific education?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No religion can be backed up like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why you bring religion at all? It is science. Religion is a kind of faith. But science is not faith. You may have faith or may not have faith. Science, "Two plus two equal to four," everywhere. Why they forget this? This is a science, <span class="Italic">vijñāna. Jñānaṁ te 'haṁ sa-vijñānaṁ idaṁ vakṣyāmy aśeṣataḥ</span> [Bg. 7.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> It is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> And they are interpreting in different way, "Two plus two equal five." Big, big men, they are doing that. Two plus two equal five because somebody, some big man has said? This is going on. Somebody said, "Two plus two equal to three"; somebody says "Two plus two equal five." "In my opinion it is five." And somebody: "In my opinion it is three." What is this nonsense? This is going on. And they are big men. They are leaders, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> This is the position of India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> But Swamiji, you are just... (Hindi) on Hindu...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I'm not (Hindi). My <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> is <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> That's all. Neither (Hindi). But what Kṛṣṇa says, I accept. That's all. They say, "Swamiji, you have done wonderful." I do not know what is magic, wonderful. But one thing wonderful I have done, that I have not adulterated on the words of Kṛṣṇa. That I have not. And therefore the effect is very good. I have not adulterated. I don't say, "Two plus two equal to five" or "three." I say "Four." Kṛṣṇa has said. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Now that is not... It's not also the quest which I am really inviting, 2 p.m., and this is the acknowledgement. And subsequently we have our dinner at Brahmanandari Place. We have a purpose, we intend, discuss at length.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, you can study. It is going on throughout the whole world. Now the Western world, they're feeling the strength. They have now begun opposition. Their politicians are thinking that "This Hare Kṛṣṇa movement is spreading like epidemic." Actually it is so. "And if it is spread so quickly, within ten years they'll take our government." They say like that. And that is possible because these young men, they have taken seriously and they're pushing on. If the majority is after them, they can take over. It is democratic, America. And how they are after this movement... If you see our latest picture of Ratha-yātrā... You have seen that film? Ratha-yātrā?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Yes. So many thousands of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Fifth Avenue.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Yes. They're pulling the chariot.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You might have seen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> I think San Francisco or somewhere?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Girirāja:</span> This is very recent, in New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> People become mad, and the papers admitted, "Here is the place for East and West to meet." And the police were so satisfied, they said, "Next year we shall make very, very nice arrangement."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Unfortunately what has happened, that several movements have merged.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is not one of the several movements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No. These people have confusion in their mind. One of course is CIA, then then FBI, then this hippie, then this narcotic people and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hundreds there are. But what we have got to do with them?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> They're addicted with those things. And also some of our own Transcendental Meditation and so forth, all these things are creating some mental confusion and lack of certain clarity which is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But we must have eyes to see. What they have got, position? All these, they go and come. But here it is entering into the core of the heart of the younger generation. They are becoming mad after it. One should have eyes to see. And therefore the authorities are afraid that "Younger generation, if they..." Here is one book by Professor Stillson Judah. He's a great, learned scholar. After five years study on this movement he has written this book, <span class="Italic">Hare Krishna and Counterculture.</span> He has given his verdict that "This movement will stay." He has very thoroughly studied the statistics and meeting every member, in this way. There are many books about us, small and big. But here is a responsible master of religious studies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> One of the earliest days, when we had this group come to our neighborhood, Mrs. Desai and myself visited. They invite together. Swami Parvati-kanta had called that in Gupta House, Natinsi Road. So our house is adjacent. Bungalow is adjacent to it. So we were there, invited there, so we joined the group. Those all people came to our bungalow subsequently, and they had some program. Then Mrs. Desai served them some food...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Our program?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Yes, sir, Hare Kṛṣṇa program. They had a program, <span class="Italic">kīrtana.</span> Then we enrolled as life member. I think that was about four years back. Swamiji from our Badranath, who is around this... Vina(?) Swami. He was there. He was saying that "Our people have forgotten our, this culture and this heritage, but people..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone says. It is purely Indian culture, and I am not getting any help from the government although they have got cultural department. Some dancing party will go; they'll pay. That is culture. And cultural knowledge is religion. This is the position. (Hindi) Real culture is neglected. And some dancing party in the name of culture will draw money and go.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Perhaps he is right, Swamiji. Nobody has studied this movement deeply.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why they don't study? It is going on worldwide. They are studying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady (2):</span> They do not study because they give their opinion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady (3):</span> Like Swamiji, the <span class="Italic">karma-yoga</span> is very important in India.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> It is true, Swamiji. You are a preacher, teacher, everything. So one of your responsibilities will be obviously to make any ignorant man knowledgeable. And these people...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady (2):</span> Excuse me, but that ignorant man must, you see, be prepared to get the knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> I'll just finish. Now, here is our people, whether they are leaders or whether they are big politician, whatever you might call. Now, having known that they suffer for certain difficulties or... We say take... You can only pity them for their lack of knowledge, and to that extent, you, out of sympathy, would naturally like to impart in them certain basic material knowledge, which has distracted them. Now, this, I think, Swamiji Vivekanandi... Because my grandfather, granduncle, was, Haridāsa Bhai Dada, was responsible for Swamiji Vivekananda's trip to America. That was sometime at turn of last century.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (4) (Indian man):</span> I have seen his latest book, <span class="Italic">Swami Too.</span> (?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> And that was my grand-uncle, my grandfather's elder brother. So we were all joint family, Hindi joint family. So Swamiji used to go round and... When I say Swamiji, I mean Vivekanandi. He used to go round and then request from us sometimes, sometimes casually, sometimes persuading... Whatever I have known from my father, who was at that time studying in Bahubiri College... He died at eighty-two years' age. Now he has finished his century, so I believe that was sometime, beginning of the last century, end of last century. So he was telling that Swamiji was quite a person, and he would never worry about (Hindi) or anything. He would still take care of his own little self-respect, but still he insisted on other people being informed with his knowledge, imparted with his knowledge. To that extent, he also, when he went to States... You said in 1902, that is, he...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> No earlier, earlier.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, he went... 1893.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> 1893. Yes, he knows these things. Turn of last century. He wrote some letters to my granduncle. Therein he has said about the immigration difficulties and other things. And then he could finally establish certain amount of respect for himself and the Indian culture. In other words, what point I am trying to make is that the world at large does not recognize the good person from a bad person. And therefore it becomes the responsibility of good person to bring at least awareness about the good person's existence, and then they follow. Now, how many people have followed Swami Vivekananda? How many people followed to start with? These things came because of his personal contact. Now, here also the same people have all praise and all respect, all things for the movement. Similarly, we have also. We came to know, and so we are in it. Now, for example, Mrs. Gandhi is highly religious, I know. Whatever others might have feeling...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> She herself is highly... The amount of respect she has got for Indian culture is terrific, to an extent of almost aggression if somebody puts a foot down or something about these things. Even Panditji, with all said and done, he had a feeling, and he was one with Mahatma Gandhi, that a day will come when India, by solving its problems, will take away the existing world from the present Western culture to a new culture, which will be of a superior level. That day would be the day when India has made good its ultimate destiny. Something like that they had feeling. So Panditji also was dreaming, but he was not an executive type of person. So Panditji had left his thing, all the dreams, but Mrs. Gandhi seems to be translating some of the dreams, or at least she feels she's translating some of the dreams into reality. The difficulty with her is that she has not proper guidance at times, and to that extent she feels she falls into certain pits of difficulties. Basically a good soul, but a soul with certain waywardness could become at times little...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So if you think that Mrs. Gandhi is religious and is for Indian culture, why not ask her to take the guidance of Kṛṣṇa? Who can give better guidance than Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian lady (2):</span> Mahatma Gandhi took guidance... Of course, he also made lots of mistakes, but he did take guidance...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone must make mistake because a conditioned soul are liable to four defects. One of them is to commit mistake. One of them is to become illusioned. One of them, he is a cheater. And one of them, his senses are imperfect. So every conditioned soul who has got this material body, he is defective in these four things. Therefore he has to take knowledge from a person who has no defects. Then his knowledge will be perfect. Just like a small child, he is defective, but he receives the knowledge from the father: "This is called pencil." A child does not know what it is, but the father says, "My dear child, it is pencil." And if he says, "It is pencil," then it is correct, although he's a child, because he has received the knowledge from the person who knows it. Similarly, our principle is-that is Vedic principle-<span class="Italic">evaṁ paramparā-prāptam imaṁ rājarṣayo viduḥ</span> [Bg. 4.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> The knowledge has to be taken from the superior, liberated person. Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> that</div>
<div class="Verse">imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ<br class="calibre2"/>proktavān aham avyayam<br class="calibre2"/>vivasvān manave prāhur<br class="calibre2"/>manur ikṣvākave 'bravīt<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.1]</div>
<div class="After-Verse"><i class="calibre3">Evaṁ paramparā-prāptam</i>: [Bg. 4.2] "First of all I said to Vivasvān." The predominating deity in the sun planet is called Vivasvān. His name is Vivasvān. So he spoke to his son Manu. Manu spoke to his son Ikṣvāku. In this way He describes, <span class="Italic">sa kāleneha mahatā yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa:</span> "That <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system is now lost. Therefore I am speaking you the old truth." <span class="Italic">Yogaḥ proktaḥ purātanaḥ.</span> That is nothing new; the same thing. And if we give up this <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system, then <span class="Italic">yogo naṣṭaḥ.</span> So nobody is taking this <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. He is interpreting in his own way. Therefore it is already <span class="Italic">naṣṭaḥ</span>; it has no value. So this is going on. <span class="Italic">Yogo naṣṭaḥ parantapa.</span> So because... Why we have to take from the authority? <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because guru means he presents the truth as it is. And as soon as you interpret, it is <span class="Italic">naṣṭaḥ</span>; it is spoiled. They are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> but they do not take this instruction, that "I am presenting <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> in a way which is spoiled." And they're insisting. So if you think that Indira Gandhi... I think so also because I have heard so many times. Why not...? His (Her) position is very nice. If he (she) actually follows the instruction of Kṛṣṇa, his (her) position will be more secure. That is sure. Let her take this. She...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> But who will advise her, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I will advise!</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Ah, that is it. That is the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You arrange, I will advise her. I am not proud, but I am the authority at the present moment. It is not pride. It is the fact! So let her take! Let her understand. The authority is there. And what is understanding? It is simple truth. Everyone can understand. Any child can understand. There is no difficulty. We make it difficult by our rascal interpretation. And that is very simple thing. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām</span> [Bg 10.2]<span class="Italic">.</span> So there must be somebody, original person. You are existing, you are coming from your father. Your father coming from his father, his father, his father... Now, who is the original father? There must be somebody. You may or may not know. So here is the answer: <span class="Italic">aham ādir hi devānām.</span> So why don't you take? Where is the difficulty? If you are finding out who is the original person and the original person is presenting Himself and He is being accepted by great authorities-formerly Vyāsadeva, Nārada, Asita, Devala, and later on Rāmānujācārya Madhvācārya, and all big, big stalwart <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> Caitanya Mahāprabhu-so why don't you accept Kṛṣṇa the supreme original authority? What is the difficulty? The fact is very plain, but I'll not take it. If I misguide myself, then who will guide me? If I sleep while I am not sleeping, then who will help me? Take Kṛṣṇa's instruction. If Indira Gandhi... I know she is intelligent, she is religious. Let her follow strictly the instruction of Kṛṣṇa. Just his, all her ambition, all her programs, will be successful-if he's (she's) serious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Now, since you have shown the repeated willingness to talk to her directly, so I'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It is science. There is no difficulty to understand</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> I'll talk to her. Even I'll talk to her personally, that "Swamiji would be delighted to..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But whether she has got time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> She's... That is the... Now, that is on one point I must tell you one small thing, that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> One lady... She is Subash Bose's niece, Lalitā Bose. You see? Because these family are very intimately..., Subash Bose's family and Nehru family. So she calls Indira "<span class="Italic">Didi,</span>" means "elder sister." So she took me, and she gave me interview at a very critical moment, just day before that Bujhibanlal(?) was killed, and she was guarded by heavy number of police and soldier. Still, she allowed my car to enter. I am very much obliged. But it was ten minutes' time. So what <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> could be discussed in ten minutes? <span class="Italic">Tad viddhi praṇipātena paripraśnena sevayā</span> [Bg. 4.34]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to learn <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> submissively, <span class="Italic">praṇipātena, paripraśnena,</span> by sincere inquiry, and learn it from a person who has seen. <span class="Italic">Upadekṣyanti tad jñānaṁ jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ.</span> You cannot have any knowledge, who has not seen the truth. If you say that "How it is possible that you have...?" We have seen through this <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. The same thing: "This is pencil." I have learned it from my father, "It is pencil," that's all. You cannot call it stick. It is pencil. My father has taught that "This is pencil." I know this. That's all. It is very easy. But if one follows, his life is successful. Very easy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> So your impression is that ten minutes or whatever time is not adequate, and unless she prepares her ground for stable, continuous...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, she can... <span class="Italic">Paripraśna.</span> From scientific point of view, from logic, that is accepted. But if he (she) thinks blindly something, then it is not possible.</div>
<div class="Verse">tad viddhi praṇipātena<br class="calibre2"/>paripraśnena sevayā<br class="calibre2"/>upadekṣyanti tad jñānam<br class="calibre2"/>jñāninas tattva-darśinaḥ<br class="calibre2"/> [Bg. 4.34]</div>
<div class="After-Verse">Just like Arjuna learned <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> from Kṛṣṇa. He submitted, <span class="Italic">śiṣyas te 'haṁ śādhi māṁ prapannam [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 2.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> So in that attitude... But <span class="Italic">pariprasna,</span> counter-inquiry is allowed. Just like good logician, good scientist, one can... That answer is there. But if one inquires as a blind person, keeping her faith or his faith in something differently, then it is as useless. It must be flexible to the level of logic and science. Then it is very easy. That is like I explained. Kṛṣṇa said, <span class="Italic">tathā dehāntara-prāptiḥ [Bg. </span>2.13<span class="Italic">].</span> So where is the difficulty? I am changing my body. So why I shall not get another body after my death? <span class="Italic">Na hanyate hanyamāne śarīre</span> [Bg. 2.20]<span class="Italic">.</span> And wherefrom this knowledge is coming? From Kṛṣṇa, the supreme authority. In the beginning I may not understand, but it is a fact. If you think over, you'll understand, "Yes, I am eternal. Why I am put into this difficulty, changing this body?" This is common sense. "Why I shall die? Why not stop death?" That is knowledge. That is knowledge. But then going on, (Hindi): "Everyone dies. I will die. What is that?" But why you shall die? You live. And Kṛṣṇa gives the formula. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> Take this process. This body is material; you have to give it up. But no more material body. Why don't you take this science; how it is possible? Why do you not contribute this science to the whole world as India's contribution? They need it. Why you go beg? Give something. In Berkeley University, one Indian student, "Swamiji, what this <span class="Italic">hari-kīrtana</span> will do? We require now technology." So I replied, "Yes, you have come to beg here. I have come to give something. I am not a beggar like you." So we are working... Of course, we are Indian, we are poor. That is another thing. But I never went to beg something from them. I never asked them any money. I never asked them. They give me money because they understand that I am giving something. Do you know how we are selling our books? Daily, five, six <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> rupees collected. They are getting the money. I have given them the knowledge. (aside:) Bring that telegram. In one week how many books we have sold? Because they're hankering after this knowledge. This is Indian culture, or some dancing party goes, that is Indian culture?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Presently you are...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I am not imitating them. Of course, all credit to Vivekananda. But Vivekananda learned something from them: how to eat meat. And introduced amongst the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> that "There is no harm in eating meat." So Vivekananda learned something from them. And I have gone to-"Forget meat-eating." That is the difference. These boys, these young boys... Just see how they have become Vaiṣṇava.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Would it be all right to open the window?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes. No, you can open the fan, one point. This is the real culture, original culture of India, and they are accepting it. Why not government come to my help? Without any help I am doing so much.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> This is exceptionally, I would say, very creditable. When you say...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We are increasing. There is opposition against our movement, and still, we are increasing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> When you say, "We are poor..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, so-called poor.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> That's it. Because the other day when I was reading Howard Hughes and his billion-dollar life, and then also Poli(?), I can say this much, that some of our poorest of Indians are far better off than these gentlemen.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, culturally we are better off. Materially, we are certainly very poor. But because we are culturally advanced, even the actual poor man, he does not feel that he is in poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> Yes, that is the case. That is... There is a basic grace in poverty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is...</div>

<div class="After-Verse">This is culture. "So long I have got money, I am very happy." No! "If there is not a single farthing, still, I'll be happy." That is real culture. That can be done That is possible when one is Kṛṣṇa conscious. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ labdhvā cāparaṁ lābhaṁ.</span> Just like Dhruva Mahārāja. He went to the forest to ask Kṛṣṇa to give him a very nice kingdom, but when he met Kṛṣṇa, Nārāyaṇa-He wanted to give him benediction-he said, <span class="Italic">svamin kṛtartho 'smi varaṁ na yace: [Cc. Madhya 22.42]</span> "<span class="Italic">Bas,</span> no more <span class="Italic">vara.</span>" So we have got such things. <span class="Italic">Guruṇāpi duḥkhena na vicālyate</span> [<i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 6.20-23]<span class="Italic">.</span> Never disturbed. That is culture. And "So long I have got money in the pocket, I am very happy"-that is dog civilization.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Because we are educated. So we have to uneducate ourselves to understand this.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is real culture, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> I'm preaching that, <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> Swamiji, what is the way out now? We have understood the present position, and you have also realized. You have seen the... And I don't want to take... I know that this ten-minutes' talk will not bring any satisfaction on either side. Now that has put me into a new thinking, that she's presently more worried about...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is a politics. You must be worried. You must be worried. That is material world. So so long you are in the material platform, you must be worried. There is no exception. And I have seen in that time, how much worried she was at that time. Yes. So it does not mean because she is Prime Minister, there is no worry. It is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest (1):</span> She's very worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is very worried.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">D. D. Desai:</span> More worried. (laughs)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Everyone is very worried. That is described by Prahlāda Mahārāja. When Hiraṇyakaśipu... After all, they are father and son. He inquired from the son, "My dear son, what best thing you have learned?"S So he said, "My dear..." He did not say "My dear father." He said "The best of the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span>" He addressed his father, "The best of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span>." <span class="Italic">Tat sādhu manye asura varya dehinam.</span> "My dear the best of the <span class="Italic">asuras...</span>" He was the best of the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> "So I think that is best education..." <span class="Italic">Tat sādhu manye 'sura-varya dehinām. Dehināṁ sadā samudvignam asad-grahāt.</span> [break] We have got good rooms like this, not that one has to go to the forest. Even in the Vṛndāvana we have got very good room, but nobody's coming. This is the position. After fiftieth year, voluntarily one must commit civil suicide-no family. And that is Vedic. But he will think of family up to the point of being killed by this revolver. This is going on. Even Gandhi, what to speak of others. He presented himself as very <span class="Italic">tyāgī,</span> but unless he was killed, he did not give up his ambition. "How my sons, how my countrymen will be happy?" And what happiness you can give? You are not God. Who is taking care of them? But this is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> He was thinking, "If I am not there, then whatever I have got, it will be finished."</div>
