<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is called hog life, how to maintain this body. <span class="Italic">Kaṣṭan kāmān. Kāmān</span> means necessities of life. Very, with great difficulty... [break] ...<span class="Italic">kāmān.</span> Life can be easily maintained by agriculture and cow protection. No. They will start big, big mills, factories, motor tires, cars, instruments. <span class="Italic">Kaṣṭan kāmān.</span> In the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is called <span class="Italic">ugra-karma,</span> fierce... (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. Fierceful activities.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Vraja-vasi:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Kaṣṭan kāmān.</span> Unnecessarily creating problems. [break] ...one after another, one after another. Formerly paper was used only for Vedic knowledge. Now the paper used for so many useless newspaper, volumes and volumes and <span class="Italic">jasusi</span>(?), unnecessarily creating agitation of the mind. And if you explain these things they will say, "This is all primitive ideas." Modern ideas means one must work very hard day and night to get a little piece of <span class="Italic">capati.</span> Hm? What is the answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If we don't work hard they say, "You are a burden on society.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If a person doesn't work hard day and night they say, "You are just living on society."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That I am explaining. The day and night is that pig is working. That I am explaining. Then what is the difference between the pig and me if I am also working hard like that pig? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's no difference.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why you say you are advanced civilization? That is forbidden. <span class="Italic">Kaṣṭan kāmān na arhati.</span> It is not desirable; it is not good. You are given this body different from this pig because you will live peacefully and happily. Why should you accept <span class="Italic">kaṣṭan kāman,</span> so hardship? Actually they do not want to work hard. Otherwise why the proprietor, the capitalist, they leave the factory and go to a solitary place? Why does he go?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't find any happiness even in the hard work.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The other worker, he is seeing that "This rascal has engaged us in hard work and he is enjoying. So drive him out. Kill him." This is communism. Everyone wants that, comfort, peacefully living. Therefore this civilization, to work hard, is condemned. If hard work is desirable why the capitalists avoiding? Hm? What is answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> They say they worked hard to get there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> They worked hard to get there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> "To get there" means?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> To get to their position they worked hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is their position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> Of relaxation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Relaxing. I am relaxing. Why you are inducing me? I am relaxing. Then why you are inducing me to work hard? I am already relaxing. Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa and take little <span class="Italic">prasāda.</span> That's all. Why you are inducing me to work hard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They say you have to earn your relaxation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But earn or not earn, I am enjoying relaxation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> You're not entitled unless you work very hard.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. That is nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Upendra:</span> In America they say you have to pay for freedom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, freedom, if I have got already, why shall I pay? I have already paid. Why you're inducing? I am already enjoying. Why you are inducing me to work hard? I have paid for it. By my <span class="Italic">karma</span> in my previous life I have already paid for that; therefore I am enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They don't believe in the law of <span class="Italic">karma.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore they are rascals. Rascal. This is a rascal civilization. Rascal civilization: one side, they say contraceptive; another side, they will encourage woman to marry three times a week. This is their civilization. If you want stop population why you are inducing "Indulge in sex life"? Stop sex life-<span class="Italic">brahmacārī.</span> Everything is contradictory. And it is all sense gratification, based on sense gratification.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> If a person is not satisfying his senses they think he is crazy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But where is your sense satisfied? You are crazy. You are repeatedly being kicked by nature, that your senses will never be satisfied. Still, you are trying for that. Even the old man of eighty years old, he is going to the nightclub. Where is sense satis... When his senses will be satisfied? (aside) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Relaxation. If somebody is relaxing, chanting, they will induce, "Oh, you are escaping."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> "Misery loves company."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> That's a saying, that if someone is feeling misery, he wants other people to also enjoy the misery.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> No one wants to suffer alone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Cutting the tail of the jackal. (Bengali) "My tail is cut, so your tail must be cut." This is a fashion. (pause) That is practical. The world is working so hard but where is the peace and happiness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's coming.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (laughs) When it will come? That is unknown.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Maybe at the end of this century.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And at the end of your life. Just like insurance policy. You'll be happy after death. "You go on paying now, work hard, go on paying the premium and you'll be happy after death." This is insurance policy. And I am going to be a dog after death, and how he'll be happy? Just see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> It is evident that miseries are growing darker and darker.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That must be because you are under nature's law. How you can avoid? As you are working, you will get the result. <span class="Italic">Karmana daiva-netrena [SB </span>3.31.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> There is superior power to supervise how you are working.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (2):</span> <span class="Italic">Karmana baddhyate jantur vidyaya...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. <span class="Italic">Karmana baddhyate.</span> They do not know. Poor fund of knowledge. Rascals. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Kṛṣṇa comes to inform these rascals, "You are all <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtina, mūḍha.</span>" That is Kṛṣṇa's declaration. <span class="Italic">Na maṁ duṣkṛtino mū...</span> "Therefore surrender unto Me." This is the whole purpose.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian Man (2):</span></div>
<div class="Verse">bahūni me vyatītāni<br class="calibre2"/>janmāni tava cārjuna<br class="calibre2"/>tāny ahaṁ veda sarvāṇi<br class="calibre2"/>na tvaṁ vettha parantapa</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the difference between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. Although Arjuna is... Birth after birth, he is friend of Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">nitya-siddha.</span> Still, he forgets, what to speak of others. <span class="Italic">Bahūni me janmāni tava cārjuna.</span> That means, "We are friends always. So you also appear; I also appear. But the difference is you forget; I don't forget. That is difference between you and Me. You also don't forget. That is for limited time. But the consciousness is the same. Only difference is that My consciousness is unlimited; your consciousness is limited. That is difference." This understanding is <span class="Italic">ahaṁ brahmāsmi.</span> My consciousness and Kṛṣṇa's consciousness, that is fact. But Kṛṣṇa's consciousness is everywhere; my consciousness is within myself. That's all. The Māyāvādī interprets, <span class="Italic">yena sarvam idaṁ tataḥ:</span> "One who is expanded everywhere, pervaded." But I am not pervading everywhere.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> They say when you become liberated then you become..., then you pervade everywhere. It's just that... They say that just now, in this position...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So when you will be liberated? What is the standard of liberation?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> By performing austerities, by studying the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right. What is the standard?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> When I merge, when I lose my identity, when I don't...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That means you forget. You forget everything. Then how you will be liberated? Whatever little consciousness was there, that is finished. Then how you become liberated? Whatever you had, that is also finished. Eh? Then how you become liberated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> But what we are forgetting is just illusion anyway.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is liberation. Then I kill you, you forget everything-liberation. (laughter) What is the meaning of liberation? They do not know even the meaning of liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> To get rid of all these miseries.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That you can do. I can kill you; you get rid of all miseries. Finished. You are finished; your miseries are finished. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It doesn't matter whether you live or you die because it is all one.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, let me kill you. That's all right. It will be great beneficial to you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> To my opinion, we are more liberated in... (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Your opinion, my opinion. We have to consider the fact. (Vraja-vasi passes by, singing) This is <span class="Italic">jīvan ko sabadiya tomara.</span> This is surrender, that he is singing, <span class="Italic">jīvan ko sabadiya:</span> "When I surrender unto Your lotus feet." That is surrender. This is liberation. Just like the child fully surrendered to the parent, he is liberated. He has no anxiety. He is confident "My parents are there. Whatever he'll do, that's all right for me." That is liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> We can become free from all anxieties.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is liberation. If you are filled up with anxieties where is your liberation? That is not liberation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> They will also say that this condition of being one with the Supreme is also...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you become one? If Kṛṣṇa or the consciousness is there but you lose your consciousness, why you become one?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, it's not exactly that we lose consciousness but we merge into the supreme consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Supreme consciousness?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Then we become God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. You cannot. Then why you are different now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's my <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then if it is <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> then why you are undergoing austerity? That is also <span class="Italic">līlā.</span> If it is <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> then why you are trying to get out of it by practicing austerity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Mahārāja Ṛṣabhadeva performed austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Ṛṣabhadeva, he performed austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, what...? I do not follow what you say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He's saying that Ṛṣabhadeva performed austerity, so therefore I am performing austerity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are performing but what is Ṛṣabhadeva's position?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> He never claimed to merge with the supreme consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But the whole thing is that the supreme consciousness is unembodied and we are embodied right now. So when we attain supreme consciousness we also become unembodied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> How you become embodied if you are supreme? Who made you embodied if you are supreme? Then who made you embodied, he is supreme. You are not supreme. You did not like to be embodied; therefore you are trying to be bodyless. But who made you embodied? Then that he or she is supreme. You are not supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> I put myself in this condition so that I can enjoy getting out of it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> I put myself in this condition of illusion so that I can enjoy being liberated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And so you put yourself to be kicked by me and enjoy. Just test what is the enjoyment of being kicked.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhanañjaya:</span> But without pain how can you experience pleasure?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You get this experience, how it is pleasure? I kick and you enjoy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> The idea is that after experiencing the suffering of this material world then liberation will be very...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why there is suffering, material? You are supreme; why it is suffering for you?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> Well, so that when I...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So, there is no "so that." Why you are suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> It's suffering only for those...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> If it is your <span class="Italic">līlā,</span> then you are suffering. What is this nonsense of "my <span class="Italic">līlā.</span>" Suffering?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The suffering is only for those who haven't..., who don't understand that they are supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Those who don't understand, they are the ones who suffer, but I don't suffer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So it is better to remain in that ignorance. Just like the hogs and dogs, they do not understand that this is suffering. But we can understand that this is suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes. To be a dog, that's all right because the dog doesn't suffer. He is enjoying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, why you are doing austerity? Remain as dog and cat. Therefore you are <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> You do not know what is suffering, what is enjoyment. <span class="Italic">Mūḍho nābhijānāti mam ebhyaḥ param avyayam.</span> Therefore one who is intelligent, <span class="Italic">jñāni, bahūnām jan...</span> After suffering in this way and talking all nonsense, when he comes to the real knowledge, then he surrenders. <span class="Italic">Bahūnāṁ janmanām ante jñānavān maṁ prapadyate [Bg. </span>7.19]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> <span class="Italic">Kamādinaṁ katīna katidha palita durnideśaḥ.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah. When he comes to this awareness, that "I have simply suffered and I wanted to maintain myself by jugglery of words," then he comes to the real knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> So the Māyāvādīs' philosophy is actually the supreme illusion.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Therefore Caitanya Mahāprabhu has forbidden. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī-bhāṣya sunile haya sarva nasa</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. <span class="calibre3"></span></i>Madhya 6.169]<span class="Italic">.</span> One is finished if he follows the Māyāvāda philosophy. He is doomed. He will never be able to accept the real philosophy. He will be absorbed in that false philosophy. This is Māyāvādī's position. <span class="Italic">Māyāvādī haya kṛṣṇe aparādhī.</span> They are <span class="Italic">aparādhī,</span> offender. Therefore they shall remain perpetually in ignorance and think himself, "I am God." This is Māyāvādī's position. Vivekānanda preached openly that "Why you are thinking that you are sinful? You are God." He preached like that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Christians, they have a concept of sin. So when Vivekānanda went to America he was telling them, "No, you forget this concept. Whatever you do, it's all right because you are God." They were surprised.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> That's why they liked him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. They did not like. The Christian priests did not like him. They condemned him, "Oh, you are come from India, and you are speaking nonsense, this?" In those hundred years the Christian priests were conscious: "But how is this? From India he has come and he's talking like nonsense?" They questioned in Chicago speech.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> He's just fanning the fires of atheism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> This Māyāvādī philosophy, is this...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are atheist. They are first-class atheist, more than the Buddhist. <span class="Italic">Veda na maniya bauddha haila nāstika.</span> The Buddhists, they did not accept Vedic authorities; therefore they are considered as <span class="Italic">nāstika.</span> But <span class="Italic">vedāśraya nāstikya vada.</span> These rascals, they accept <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and preaches atheism. So they are more dangerous than the Buddhists. This is Caitanya Mahāprabhu's version. (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Bauddha ke adhika:</span> "They are more dangerous than the Buddhists." The Buddhists, although they are supposed to be atheists, they worship the Deity Lord Buddha. But they say it is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> And more advanced than these atheists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> The Māyāvādīs.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> More... Not advanced. More degraded. These atheists, they have been taught to worship the form of Lord Buddha, and Buddha is incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, so one day they will be delivered. But these rascals will never be delivered.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> I read in one of your books so many names about different groups of these Māyāvādī philosophers. Are they still existing today and active?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Anyone who thinks godlessness, he is Māyāvādī, that's all. Anyone. All these impersonalists, they are all Māyāvādīs. And mostly they are now impersonalists.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> So although we can't see it with our material eyes, their position is very precarious.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We have no eyes to see. We see through Kṛṣṇa. As Kṛṣṇa sees, we see. This is Kṛṣṇa conscious. We are not perfect. Our position is that we are not perfect. But we are perfect so long we follow Kṛṣṇa, that's all. Just like I am blind man. I am not perfect. But if you have got eyes, if you take me I follow you. Then I am perfect. Kṛṣṇa assures that "You surrender to Me and I will make you free from all dangers," and we accept Kṛṣṇa. That's all. Our method is very easy. The child is walking, unable to walk, falling down. The parents say, father says, "My dear child, just catch my hand." Then he's safe. These Māyāvādīs, they go against the verdict of God. God says that "The living entities are My part and parcel," and they say, "I am God." So that is their foolishness. Part and parcel... Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">mamaivaṁso jīva-bhutaḥ</span><i class="calibre3"> </i>[Bg. 15.7]<span class="Italic">.</span> Otherwise why God says, "Surrender unto Me," if you are equal with Him? Why God is asking, "Surrender unto Me"? You are not equal. You are rascal. You are claiming that "I am equal." Otherwise there is no question of surrender. "You surrender unto Me." And this knowledge of surrender comes, Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">bahūnāṁ janmanām:</span> "This rascal is always thinking 'I am God, God, God.' This rascaldom is finished after many, many births, this ignorance." Then he surrenders. How the living entity is equal with God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Return?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> Of course, they may say that "Kṛṣṇa is just an ordinary man like me and therefore He is asking..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Therefore you are rascal. Kṛṣṇa is ordinary man, and He is lifting the hill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Well, that's just a story in a book.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He may be story for you. You may not believe that you have got a father but we are not mad. You can say, "To have a father is a story," but mother says, "No, you have your father." She is authority. You can say, "Oh, it is story."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They want historical evidence for everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes, why doesn't Kṛṣṇa come and do it now?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is not your father's servant, that he will come by your order. He's the supreme master. Kṛṣṇa is doing the same thing still, but you have no eyes to see. Kṛṣṇa is doing. How this Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading all over the world?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Why doesn't God force me to surrender?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That Kṛṣṇa is not a nonsense like you. Because Kṛṣṇa has given you little freedom He does not want to touch it. That is Kṛṣṇa. What He gives, He never takes it back. It is not a nonsensical award that "I give you sometimes; then I take it away." Kṛṣṇa does not do such. He has given you little freedom, so you can use it. <span class="Italic">Yathecchasi tathā kuru [</span><i class="calibre3">Bg</i>. 18.63]<span class="Italic">,</span> Kṛṣṇa says in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad...,</span> "Whatever you like, you do." That freedom is taken by nature. You are human being. If you do not engage yourself in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then nature will withdraw this privilege and you'll become a dog. Kṛṣṇa does not take, but His agent, <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> will take it away. Just like the police is the agent of the king or the government. The government does not care what you are doing. But if you do something criminal the police will punish you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> But we're going to change the laws of nature.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another foolishness. (laughter) That is also replied, <span class="Italic">daivī hy eṣā guṇamayī mama māyā dura...</span> [Bg. 7.14]. "You cannot do that, my dear sir. You rascal, you are thinking like that. That is not possible."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But they say they've already made so much progress.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You go on making progress but you will never come to the ultimate goal. You can go on foolishly. That's all right. Just like they made progress, United Nations. What progress they have made?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> They made a nice building.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's right. (laughs) There are so many buildings.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> But they've been going to be assassinated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> When I go that building, United Nations, I see how they are wasting money. Yes, I see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They have a very big budget, United Nations, billions of...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Big, big. So many publications, so many big...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> They make everybody un-united.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh? Yes. Disunited.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Pṛthu-putra:</span> You have written in one of your books that they are just becoming more flags instead of less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Yes. They are increasing flags. Instead of one flag, they increasing flags. And they are trying for the last how many years? Thirty years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> To stop wars. But they haven't stopped a single war.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> But if Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme and I should surrender unto Him, then why is it so hard to find out this knowledge? Why is it that only in the human form of life... Why is it so difficult to come to this knowledge if...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are rascal. For rascal everything is difficult. Easy thing is made difficult by rascals. That is the proof that you are rascal. By nature one is supposed to surrender to the parents. This is easy. Why do you do not do this? This is natural. Just like you have surrendered to me. Why? Because you think I am superior, you have to take knowledge from me. So if you have to accept some superior for your guidance, how you can deny surrendering? You see, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī,</span> he is being taught <span class="Italic">daṇḍavat śīraṣi,</span> by touching the head. Yesterday we were talking of that <span class="Italic">brahmacārī?</span> That is the instruction. Who is this boy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He's Kuṇḍali. He just came from New York.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He just came from New York. He's from the West... He's a Commonwealth citizen. He's from the West Indies. He says he'll stay in India for the rest of his life.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, that's nice. So you are going to the magistrate? You have calculated?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Ten thousand bags.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ten thousand bags. No, I wanted to construct this building with bricks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> Yes, but we have to make some slabs and some...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Slabs? So still you will require ten thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No. If we do with mud, then it will be much less.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not mud. The mortar means sand and cement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guṇārṇava:</span> No plaster?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, plastering also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No plastering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, plastering also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> But it comes to about eight thousand bags if I do the whole land like that around. That is the full thing, two stories. It comes to about eight thousand. And then there's always some extra for finalizing the floors...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. I don't want to use this iron.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> No, we don't require iron.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Simply brick. So in that way you still require ten thousand?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Saurabha:</span> We require about eight thousand but it's best to apply for ten thousand. If we only need five thousand, we take that. They will give us that allotment.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Do it. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> When Kṛṣṇa would play His flute then the airplanes would be there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> When Kṛṣṇa would play His flute then the airplanes would come and...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is Kṛṣṇa playing flute?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭaketu:</span> In Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh. Then why the airplanes do not come Delhi? (laughter) (pause) He is godless and we have to fight against them. Just see our position. We have to fight with the whole world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Number of forces will increase day by day.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Number of forces are increasing day by day, they will fight adequately.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Gopāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But you have done it singlehanded, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Single-handed, double-handed, doesn't matter-if Kṛṣṇa is there in the background. Arjuna fought singlehanded. Where is Praṇava? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> (Hindi) Everyone was very much satisfied.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is wanted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Our Prabhupāda is kind enough to make so many swans like us to remove away all the evils of the world.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside) <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. (end)</div>
