<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...kinds of rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> One theory is that there has always..., the material nature has always existed. It was never created, and it will never be annihilated, and there is no other cause. It's simply an eternal fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But how always existed? Nothing here ever exists... This house was never existed. It's created.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> But the elements existed.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Elements exist, that's all right, but the format, how it is created?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They say it's not created. It's an eternal, unexplainable fact.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ha ha. That he is a foolish. That is rascal. Immediately rascal is captured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] Unexplainable, that means why he is trying to explain, rascal? Immediately captured.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You may all laugh now, but in the future we're going to find a solution.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another rascaldom. "I am rascal, and future I am going to be very intelligent." Talk of presence. You are, at the present moment, you are rascal. That's all. Don't talk. Rascal cannot talk.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Another theory which is taught...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So this theory is rascaldom. Then another theory...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Is that actually God created everything, but after creation God is no lon...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, then... No, that's all right, "God created everything." That means acceptance of God. Then we come to the science of God, what is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, God created, but now God is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Don't imagine. I am asking what is the current theory.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, that God is... God now is in a dormant condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> God is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God is dead. After creating, He is dead.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> He used Himself up.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, but, no, they say... No, that's not what they say. They say that God created, and now God is in a dormant condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever condition, there is God. That you have to accept.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now, what is that God?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Well, God does not directly take part in the material creation. He simply created...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right, but He creates by His energy. Just like I am creating this institution, but I am not doing directly, but my men or my assistants, they are doing it. (sound like conch) What is this sound?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Intercom.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So why this intercom? Inter...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> To speak from one room to another.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It connects the <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> room and... It connects the <span class="Italic">pūjārī</span> room, the office, your secretary, and up here, Bhavānanda Mahārāja.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...accepted, now He created and that... What is that next? Explain.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Now God is dormant, in a dormant condition.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that dormant?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He has no more activity. He simply created, and now He has no more activity.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Well, "no more activities," that's all right, but He is active. Suppose I am walking. I may not walk half an hour. That means I have got the capacity of walking. That you cannot say, that my walk... Because I have now stopped walking, you cannot say that I cannot walk. Is another nonsense. How you can say "dormant"? He is active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Dormant implies He was active.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Was active, He is active, but you, you rascal, you cannot see. You cannot say, "Once He was active. Now He is no more active. He has finished His activity." That you cannot say. Dormant? What do you mean by dormant? Huh? Dormant means potential. He can act. And He is acting. That acting you have to learn, how He is acting. He appears to be not acting, but He is acting. That is knowledge. Just like airplane is running. A intelligent man knows that "The pilot is there. He is acting. Therefore it is running." And a foolish man will say, "The airplane is going automatically." That is the question of observation. A foolish boy... I have given this example many times, that I was thinking that in the fan there is a ghost. But the idea is, there must be somebody. Although I was a child... I could not explain how the fan is running in my childhood. I was thinking there must be some ghost. And in the gramophone box I was thinking there must be one man within this box. So this is foolish thinking, but I was convinced that without somebody, it cannot sing or it cannot run. Even one is very innocent child, he can think like that. So whole thing is going on, <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> the activities of material nature... Just like there was cloud and rain. Now it is not raining. So there is activity already. It is being managed. So you cannot say that God is dormant. He is acting because His creation is acting, and God says that <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram: [Bg. 9.10]</span> "Under My direction the nature is working." How you can say He is dormant? The nature is working?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Well, just like a man may make a chemical reaction in the beginning by mixing two or three chemicals, but then the reaction takes place by itself. It doesn't need the man once he started it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, doesn't need the man... He is needed for another reaction. That will not take automatically.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So another theory is why you have to say that there is a cause? It was always there. There was no cause. It was always there...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, it is caused. Why do you say "God created"?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we say there is no God, and the creation was always there. There's no question of it not being there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> There was always there. There was always...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> It's eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's eternal. There's no question of any creator being required. It is there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. Then why do you say, "God created and He became...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> We don't say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He said.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> He's another rascal. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He has... He is some sentimentalist, a fanatic, religious fanatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you talk. He said "God created." You say not. Then you talk. Now you decide. Now he has accused you that you are a nonsense.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> He's a religious fanatic. I told him, he's a religious fanatic.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Not fanatic. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> You have no explanation, so you're simply giving it the name God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, why not explanation? Why not explanation, that "Nature is working"? He said that "God is dormant. God created," and he accepted. And "God is dormant. He is not doing anything." But no, that's not the fact. The nature's work is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Nature is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So the nature is directed by God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Why not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It's not. It's moving of its own accord.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then he is another rascal. Nature cannot work automatically. Just like mother. Nature-mother. The mother cannot produce child without father.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. Father and mother required.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. So how do you say, "The mother is producing child without any father"? That you cannot say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, but why are you comparing nature to a father and mother?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is also nature. Everything is nature. Are you outside nature? That is another nonsense. Your body is nature; your activities are nature; everything is nature. How you can say you are out of nature? <span class="Italic">Prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi [Bg. </span>3.27]<span class="Italic">.</span> He has got some intelligence, I have got some intelligence, but the intelligence is coming from nature. Otherwise how you are intelligent? Somebody is intelligent; somebody is dull. Unless there is some background, how do you find the difference? Here you see some flower is red, some flower... Why? How it is being done? You cannot say "automatically."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we say... We agree, everything came originally from some elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That "some" He has explained. He is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, we don't... We say that those elements were always there. There is no need of any creator of those elements. They were always there.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They are the basic elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, "always there," but there must have been creation of these elements. Just like in the laboratory, you... Soda bicarb. Carbonate mixed with soda makes soda bicarb. Sulfuric acid. You take sulphur and turn into acid by mixing with something else. That is going on.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> But the original elements were there. There's no need of any creator.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You are already... That you know, do not know, but the original elements also produced. That is not automatic. Anything you are taking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, we have no... How can you say what happened so many years ago?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> We don't say, "so many years." We say it is created by...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What is your proof?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Proof? What proof you want?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, what is your proof of what happened millions of years ago at the beginning of creation? You say that...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the same thing is going on. Millions of years there was sunrise. Now sunrise is still going on. Do you think that millions of years there was no sunrise? It is going on. The same thing is going on now here. Because you are foolish, you cannot see. Nothing has changed. The same thing is going on. Millions of years the father-mother combined and there was child, and that is going on still.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Oh, no. No, no, no. That's only been going on for about three thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, no, even the scientists don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Yeah. Four or five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, no, no, scientists don't say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> At most, fifteen thousand years, they say.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, no, no, they don't say that. You have to keep up to date. It makes good arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> What do you mean?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> They don't... They say now millions of years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> What? Human beings?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes. How to present good arguments.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Millions of years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, they say that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> One scientist said that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> No, no, no. It's accepted.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Really?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> Yes, I've seen many quotes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> I was in an anthropology department. They don't accept millions of years. They said forty thousand years ago there were no...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And what was before forty thousand years?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Apes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And wherefrom the apes came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Lesser..., lesser-mentality beings. Everything originated...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So anything is a development. That is, therefore, called Darwin's theory of evolution. But where the evolution begins? That is the question.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> It begins from these primordial elements.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So where that elements came?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> They were always there. They are eternal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? Then why you say, "From this time it begun"? Everything is eternal. There is no question of beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Why is because it developed?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. All rascals, simply rascals.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Well, it's not very easy for us to give good argument with these bogus...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We can't even keep up with their theories.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> The main argument among the philosophers, the atheistic philosophers, is that "God could not exist because if God existed, if God were good, then why would we be suffering? God would stop our suffering."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Right. If your father's good...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh? No, it is criminal. That is... You say that there are so many persons in the state. Not all of them are suffering in the prisonhouse. Only the criminals. So that is the proof that you are a criminal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> God could have... God could have created me in such a way that I would never have fallen down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He has created, but He has given you independence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Jagadīśa:</span> God wants us to enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kāśirāma:</span> Why has He given us that independence if in that independence we...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then you are not living being. You are dull stone. God does not want that you remain a stone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Free will" means living being.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> But if he gave us the material world to enjoy, then why do we have to suffer here?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, enjoyments... You do not know what is enjoyment. You suffer. Just like you are voracious eater. You eat and then suffer. Then no eating. That means you are nonsense. You do not know how much to eat. Just like you require little salt with your food, and if you put one <span class="Italic">ser</span> of salt, then that is your foolishness. Because salt has to be eaten, it does not mean that you bring the whole ocean to make it salty. <span class="Italic">Tena tyaktena bhuñjīthā [Īśo mantra 1].</span> That is the instruction.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if you know how to...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever direction is there, you take that. The medicine is given. Doctor gives direction. "So many drops you can take." Now you say, "Oh, the good medicine. Let me eat the whole thing. I become cured immediately." Then you die. You have to take, enjoy, but according to direction. God does not say that "You don't enjoy." You are, what is called, <span class="Italic">ānandamayo 'bhyāsāt</span> (<span class="calibre3">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.12)<span class="Italic">.</span> A living entity means <span class="Italic">ānandamaya,</span> enjoyment. But that <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> where it is permanent <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> how we have to reach that permanent <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> that is being taught. Otherwise, you foolish, you'll eat the whole medicine and die. That's all. Therefore the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma. Varṇāśrama-dharma</span> means that is real human civilization. There is direction that "You enjoy like this." And if you become <span class="Italic">mlecchas</span> and <span class="Italic">yavanas,</span> then you'll not enjoy. You simply suffer. You do not know how to enjoy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> So if one abides by the law of God, then he can become happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> God has made that arrangement.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is stated in <span class="Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa.</span></div>
<div class="Verse">varṇāśramācāra-vatā<br class="calibre2"/>puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān<br class="calibre2"/>viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā<br class="calibre2"/>nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam<br class="calibre2"/>[<i class="calibre3">Cc. Madhya</i> 8.58]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">That is said, <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma.</span> Therefore, according to Vedic civilization, unless one comes to the regulation of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> that is not human civilization. That is actually the fact. That is the same dog's society. That is going on. If there is no <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> qualified <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> who will give direction? There is no... If there is no <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> then who will give protection? If there is no <span class="Italic">vaiśya,</span> then who will produce food? And if there is no <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> then who will work for general assistance? This is scientific.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> You have defeated us all again.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Eh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> We are all defeated.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Harikeśa:</span> Everyone.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> there is no civilization. Yes. They are trying to abolish this under the name of "caste system." It is not caste system. Caste system, or whatever you call, there must be these four division. Not four, eight. This is general, that <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya, śūdra.</span> Then, according to the brahminical culture, the spiritual, <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha, sannyāsa.</span> And after <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> then spiritual life, complete, <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. So you have to establish <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama. Varṇāśramācāra. Ācāra. Ācāra. Varṇāśrama ācāra.</span> Yes. Because the aim is... Again we come to the... Just like state affairs going on, but ultimate aim is to keep the government satisfied. Then you'll get everything nicely. Similarly, the supreme government or supreme governor is God. That is your duty, to keep Him satisfied. Then you get all direction, all facilities and life. That is the aim. But these rascals, they do not know what is government or who is the governor. They are doing anything whimsically, and they're punished. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> is there. <span class="Italic">Prakṛti</span> is there. Government does not want that you suffer, but you violate the government's law. Therefore you suffer. That these rascals do not understand. They declare, "There is no government." So this is foolishness, ignorance, <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> There is government, he sees, and still he is rascal. He says, "No, no, I don't care for anyone. There is no government." That is atheism; that is hooliganism.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hṛdayānanda:</span> So the so-called...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is dying. He doesn't want to die, but still he says, "There is no authority." He's suffering. He is becoming old. He doesn't want to become old, but he is so rascal, he does not question, "Why I am becoming old?" So therefore they are all rascals. He says, "I am independent," but he is forced to do something, and still he is independent. What is the remedy? Just like prisoner. He doesn't want to obey. The... A constable comes and kicks him, slaps him. Still, he says, "No, I am independent. I don't care for you." What is this? Hm? (Bengali?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Prabhupāda, it's time to go downstairs, if you want to walk outside...</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> ...without birth, death, disease and old age, then we can simply say that "You already were like that before, but you gave it up because of your mentality."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm? What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> A person already has the position where he doesn't have to experience birth, death, old age, like that. So if they argue like that, "Why doesn't God give us that position where we can enjoy without God consciousness...?"</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> God has given, giving you the position that "You obey Me, and you get the position," but because you are rascal-you are not obeying-you are suffering.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Tamāla Kṛṣṇa:</span> Just like a hog takes stool instead of sweetmeat. The hoggish mentality.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is God's mercy that he wants to eat stool, and God has given you, "All right, you eat stool. Take this body."</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He has got such a body that he does not relish sweetmeat.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kāśirāma:</span> Why do we have this rascal propensity?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Because you are rascal. That is the only reason. Because you are rascal.</div>
