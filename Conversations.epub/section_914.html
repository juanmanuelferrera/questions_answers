<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So one learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> he said, "All right sir, <span class="Italic">namaskār</span> your Kṛṣṇa. I cannot believe all these things." And the cobbler, he began to cry, "Ah, Kṛṣṇa is so great, He can do anything." So he, Nārada Muni asked, he saw the learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> refused to accept, and this cobbler is so absorbed that he's crying, "Ah, Kṛṣṇa can do anything." So he asked him, "Do you believe this?" "Yes, why not?" "So how do you believe it?" "Now I'm sitting under this banyan tree, and so many banyan fruits are falling down, and I can see there are hundreds and thousands of seeds within the fig, and each seed contains a banyan tree. So why can I not believe? If within this seed a big banyan tree can be kept, what is the difficulty for Kṛṣṇa to pull the elephant through the hole of a needle?" He has got reason. He is not blindly believing. How the scientist who does not believe in God, he can explain that within the small seed there is a big banyan tree? Let them do that. By chemical composition make little seed. As I told, make little egg. They cannot do anything. Still they are so proud.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhrstadyumna:</span> Yesterday we read, Śrīla Prabhupāda, that these are the qualities of the demon, that arrogance and pride, and their philosophy is there is no God in control. Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in that story, the cobbler actually was more advanced than the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> and yet in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa explains that "Anyone can approach Me, even the <span class="Italic">strī śūdra dvija bandhu,</span>" they can all approach the supreme destination. Then in the next verse he says "How much greater, then, are the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> the righteous, the devotees, the saintly kings." I was wondering how are they greater?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not understand it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> I do not understand how they are greater than the lower person who surrenders.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Suppose you have got your spiritual master and you, if somebody says that you can come into the..., any one of you can come in this car. So spiritual master goes, you also go. Does it mean that spiritual master is not greater than you? Do you think like that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then? It is the same thing. Suppose Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja has brought this car, so he says, "All of you can come." So I go, you go, does it mean that you and your spiritual master is equal? Do you think like that? It is same thing. Everyone can go to Godhead, there is no doubt, but still there is difference between <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas, śūdras.</span> So far going into the car, the equal right is there, but it does not mean that your spiritual master or the next group, they are not greater than you. Don't think like that. The same car, Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja is driving, I am also there, you are also there. Does it mean that we are all equal? There must be gradation. The right is given to everyone. It does not mean that immediately they become all one. It is Kṛṣṇa's mercy that He accepted everyone, "Come on." But the distinction is there. We are inviting everyone to partake Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">prasādam</span>. That does not mean that immediately all of them have become of the equal rank. Caitanya Mahāprabhu, He was so kind, but still there was distinction. When He was taking <span class="Italic">prasādam,</span> personal associates, they were sitting with Him. Is it not? So this is called <span class="Italic">maryādā. Maryādā</span> means honor. That must... Varieties must be there. Otherwise we become Māyāvādīs-everything is equal, all one. This is Māyāvāda philosophy. No varieties. There must be variety. That is Vaiṣṇava philosophy. And as soon as you make it varietyless, all equal, that is Māyāvāda. Just see even in this flower, this is also flower and this is also flower. Does it mean they are of the same rank? This is understanding. Together they look very beautiful, but if you take separate value, then it is valuable than this flower. That distinction must be there. If somebody says "I am accepting even the leaf in this garland," then what to speak of rose? It is like that. Kṛṣṇa says that. That does not mean leaf and rose have the same value. One is making a beautiful garland, "I am accepting everything." Mixed together it looks very nice, but individually the leaf has value, the rose has value, the flower has value. Not that because they are put together they have equal value. This is Vaiṣṇava philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> In democracy they say everyone is...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Nonsense democracy. What is...? Don't talk of this nonsense talk. (laughter). Democracy, communism, still there are varieties. But you make a president. Let everyone become president.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> That's what they've done, now the <span class="Italic">śūdras...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They have not done. Has everyone got the president's power? How do they say that you have done. Everyone equal? That is not possible. These are imagination. <span class="Italic">Mano-rathenasato dhāvato bahiḥ</span> Everything is there in the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam. Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> These rascals who are not Kṛṣṇa conscious, they have no value. They are simply speculating within the mind, <span class="Italic">mano-rathena,</span> and they'll act all abominable, because they are on the mental platform. I'll say "I think like this," you'll say "I think like this." And nobody, none of us perfect. Then what is the use of your thinking like this or thinking like that? Both of them are imperfect. So if so many rascals sit together, or dogs, they simply bark, that's all. It has no value. So our propaganda is that "Don't remain in the dog platform. Come to the human platform." That is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. There you will get, "If we all dogs meet together and pass a resolution, then it will be organized." That is democracy. Democracy means like that. The dog is kept as dog, and they are assembled together to take their votes. What is the value of their vote? They are dogs. I've publicly said this, where?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> Melbourne.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Melbourne. The United Nations is an assembly of barking dogs, I've said that, (laughs) and they published it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "His Divine Grace has come to hound us."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> There is a so-called spiritual master, Śrīla Prabhupāda, who is giving meditation courses to them.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another cheating. Meditation... Whatever nonsense they are doing, you don't know, nobody knows. That's all. <span class="Italic">Bhava satrugna.</span>(?) "If you become dumb, you have no enemy." <span class="Italic">Tāvac ca śobhate mūrkho yāvat kiñcin na bhāṣate.</span> "A rascal is beautiful so long he does not speak." So better meditation; don't speak. Nobody will detect you. This is going on. If you speak, then you'll be detected what you are. And if you sleep by posing meditation, then nobody will ask "What you are doing, nonsense?" This is meditation. Meditation is another cheating. That Prahlāda Mahārāja has detected. Huh? Find out this verse, Seventh Canto.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> This Śrī Chinmoy is supposed to be this resident guru at the United Nations.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever he may be, but we have got our own formula to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> He did a practical demonstration of what he said a person who is in touch with God can be capable of doing if he allows himself to become an instrument of God. So for eight months he painted continually, and he produced 27,000 paintings, and he said that this was proof that he was God realized.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Mauna,</span> the word begins with <span class="Italic">mauna.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Maunam,</span> like in silence. <span class="Italic">Mauna-vrata-śruta-tapo-'dhvavana?</span></div>
<div class="Verse">mauna-vrata-sruta-tapo-'dhyayana-sva-dharma-<br class="calibre2"/>vyākhya-raho-japa-samādhaya āpavargyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prāyaḥ paraṁ puruṣa te tv ajitendriyānāṁ<br class="calibre2"/>vārtā bhavanty uta na vātra tu dāmbhikānām<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.9.46]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">"O Supreme Personality of Godhead, there are ten prescribed methods on the path to liberation-to remain silent, not to speak to anyone, to observe vows, to amass all kinds of Vedic knowledge, to undergo austerities, to study the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and other Vedic literatures, to execute the duties of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> to explain the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> to stay in a solitary place, to chant <span class="Italic">mantras</span> silently, and to be absorbed in trance. These different methods for liberation are generally only a professional practice and means of livelihood..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Means of livelihood.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "...means of livelihood for those who have not conquered their senses. Because such persons are falsely proud, these procedures may not be successful."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can get some prestigious position from another rascal, but that will not solve the problem. What is the purport there?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Purport by Śrīla Prabhupāda. "As stated in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span>:</div>
<div class="Verse">kecit kevalayā bhaktyā<br class="calibre2"/>vāsudeva-parāyaṇaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>aghaṁ dhunvanti kartsnyena<br class="calibre2"/>niharam iva bhāskaraḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [SB </span>6.1.15]</div>
<div class="Purp-para">'Only a rare person who has adopted complete, unalloyed devotional service to Kṛṣṇa can uproot the weeds of sinful actions with no possibility that they will revive. He can do this simply by discharging devotional service, just as the sun can immediately dissipate fog by its rays.' The real purpose of human life is to attain liberation from material entanglement. Such liberation may be achieved by many methods-<span class="Italic">tapasa brahmacāryeṇa śamena ca damena ca [SB </span>6.1.13]-but all of them more or less depend on <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity, which begins with celibacy. Śukadeva Gosvāmī says that those who are <span class="Italic">vāsudeva-parāyaṇa,</span> who have fully surrendered to the lotus feet of Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, automatically achieve the results of <span class="Italic">mauna</span> (silence), <span class="Italic">vrata</span> (vows), and other such methods, simply by discharging devotional service."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take, for example, <span class="Italic">mauna. Mauna</span> means don't talk rubbish. It is better not to talk than to talk foolish. So <span class="Italic">mauna</span> is meant for them who cannot talk about Kṛṣṇa. Better stop talking. <span class="Italic">Mauna-vrata.</span> Because he does not know Kṛṣṇa, he'll talk all nonsense. So sometimes the spiritual master says that "You remain silent for twelve years." So (laughter) instead of talking nonsense, you remain silent for twelve years. That is <span class="Italic">mauna.</span> Because as soon as you'll talk, you'll be captured where you are. Better not to talk. This is <span class="Italic">mauna-vrata.</span> But one who is devotee, why he'll not...? He'll talk about Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Vācāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</span> Always talking about Kṛṣṇa. Why he should be silent? If he remains silent, then people will not get the benefit. Let him speak always of Kṛṣṇa. Caitanya Mahāprabhu says that <span class="Italic">yāre dekho tāre kaho kṛṣṇa-upadeśa.</span> Whomever you meet, you simply talk about Kṛṣṇa, what He has taught in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> You become guru. So why guru will stop? Guru will speak. But what kind of speaking? What Kṛṣṇa has spoken. Not nonsense. Not like that: "I have painted so many pictures, therefore I have become God realized." Where Bhagavān says "By painting pictures one may..." He does not say, Kṛṣṇa does not say. He has invented this. So therefore our test is, whether he's a bona fide guru, whether he's talking what Kṛṣṇa has said. Then he's guru. Otherwise a rascal. That's all, finished. Why should we bother? This is the test. If he's speaking, repeating the same thing, what Kṛṣṇa said, then he's guru. If he's talking something else, then he's rascal. Immediately take it. If you know this art, how to detect the rascal and guru, the test is already there. Where is the difficulty? Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> Guru will say "Surrender to Kṛṣṇa." He'll never say that "I have become Kṛṣṇa. You simply surrender to me." To surrender to Kṛṣṇa means surrender to guru also. You'll learn it. So "Kṛṣṇa is now dead; now I have become Kṛṣṇa." This is rascal, immediately. So to test a guru and a rascal, there is no difficulty if you are well conversant with the teachings of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>. There is no question. Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">ya imaṁ paramaṁ guhyaṁ mad-bhakteṣv abhidhāsyati.</span> This confidential knowledge, what is that? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān pariyajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ,</span> one who is teaching this confidential knowledge-just surrender to Kṛṣṇa-Kṛṣṇa says "Ah, he is My dearmost friend." So you become dearmost friend of Kṛṣṇa. Simply say what Kṛṣṇa says. Why do you speak all other nonsense things? You immediately become the dearmost friend of Kṛṣṇa. And if you manufacture, then you are a rascal. Why shall I accept a rascal? We shall accept the dearmost friend of Kṛṣṇa as <span class="Italic">guru</span>. That is wanted. And Caitanya Mahāprabhu said, when He was asked by a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> devotee what should be the behavior of a Vaiṣṇava, He immediately said <span class="Italic">asat-saṅga tyāga, ei vaiṣṇava ācāra: [</span>Cc. <span class="calibre3">Madhya</span> 22.87] "Give up the company of all rascals, <span class="Italic">asat.</span>" <span class="Italic">Asat</span> means those who are rascals. That is Vaiṣṇava. Do not mix with all rascals, <span class="Italic">asat.</span> Now how shall I know who is rascal and who is not a (rascal)? <span class="Italic">Asat eka 'strī-saṅgī--eka asādhu, kṛṣṇa-bhakta āra.</span> One who is too much attached with woman, he is rascal. Another rascal, who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That's all. So we have got everything test tube. Put the test tube and you understand. If one is <span class="Italic">strī-saṅgī... Strī-saṅgī</span> means not only the man, the man or woman, one who are very much sexually attached, he is a rascal. One should give up his company. And another rascal who is not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa. That's all, finished. So if you want to be a Vaiṣṇava, you must give up the company of these two rascals. Then your progress is guaranteed. Everything is there. There is no difficulty to distinguish between rascals and intelligent, guru and bluffer. Everything is there. And to become a perfect Vaiṣṇava, Caitanya Mahāprabhu said <span class="Italic">asat-saṅga tyāga ei vaiṣṇava.</span> Don't talk even with these rascals. But sometimes in the preaching work we have to talk with such rascals, but not to take their theory but to teach them our theory. If you become defeated by their theory, then you are not a preacher. Don't preach, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. You are not fit for teaching. If you become overcome by their teaching, then you are finished. A preacher is <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī,</span> advanced devotee. He can preach. <span class="Italic">Kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> should be engaged in temple worship, very nicely, then gradually he'll come to the <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī.</span> So the preacher is <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī.</span> A <span class="Italic">kaniṣṭha-adhikārī</span> cannot become preacher. He is in the lowest stage of devotional service; he cannot become preacher. He'll be conquered by the <span class="Italic">asat.</span> And <span class="Italic">madhyama-adhikārī,</span> he knows how to deal with <span class="Italic">asat.</span> At least he does not mix with them. That's all. If he cannot defeat them, he should avoid them, because that valuable time can be utilized for preaching Kṛṣṇa consciousness to a person who is inquisitive to hear. <span class="Italic">Bāliśya. Bāliśya</span> means innocent. He wants to know something about Kṛṣṇa. Better deal with him than with the rascals and waste time. Better avoid the rascals. Just like in hospital, emergency cases, the doctor, when they see that this patient hopeless, he does not take care anymore. But when there is hope, they give medicine and try to... So hopeless condition, better not. Don't talk with them. That's all. That is <span class="Italic">vaiṣṇava-ācāra.</span> Then he'll remain safe. Hopeless person, don't waste your time talking with them. <span class="Italic">Īśvare tad-adhīneṣu bāliśeṣu dviṣatsu ca.</span> Four observations. Bhagavān-<span class="Italic">īśvara; prema</span>-love. And, <span class="Italic">prema-maitrī,</span> friendship with devotees. And <span class="Italic">kṛpa,</span> mercy to the innocent person. And <span class="Italic">upekṣā,</span> no more talking. Don't waste time, talking with all these nonsense. Better utilize, properly utilize the time by instructing a person who is innocent and eager to hear. Like that. So this <span class="Italic">mauna-vrata-tapas-śruti...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><b class="calibre4">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</b></div>
<div class="Verse">mauna-vrata-śruta-tapo-'dhyāyana-sva-dharma-<br class="calibre2"/>vyākhya-raho-japa-samādhaya āpavargyaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>prāyaḥ paraṁ puruṣa te tv ajitendriyānām<br class="calibre2"/> [SB 7.9.46]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> These things are meant for <span class="Italic">ajitendriyānām,</span> who could not control the senses, <span class="Italic">ajitendriyānām.</span> And who has engaged his senses in the service of the Lord, they are not <span class="Italic">ajitendriya.</span> If you have engaged your mind in Kṛṣṇa, the mind is the king of senses; then your senses cannot be misled. <span class="Italic">Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane [SB 9.4.18].</span> Then if your mind is always in Kṛṣṇa, <span class="Italic">man-mana bhava mad bhakto,</span> then what you'll speak except Kṛṣṇa? If you speak nonsense, that means your mind is not engaged in Kṛṣṇa. The mind is the center of all sensual activities. So if your mind is always in Kṛṣṇa, how we can talk nonsense? <span class="Italic">Sa vai manaḥ kṛṣṇa-padāravindayor vacāṁsi vaikuṇṭha-guṇānuvarṇane.</span> He'll be always engaged in talking about Kṛṣṇa. That is wanted. So if we keep our mind always in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, then there is no question of <span class="Italic">mauna,</span> because we'll have to talk about Kṛṣṇa. Why shall I remain <span class="Italic">mauna</span>? If we talk about Kṛṣṇa, or what Kṛṣṇa has said, then I am benefited, and the audience, he is also benefited. Take <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and talk. So those who are Kṛṣṇa devotees, they'll gladly hear. Those who are inquisitive, innocent, they'll also hear. And the <span class="Italic">dviṣāt,</span> those who are envious, they'll go away. That's good, clear. Talk about Kṛṣṇa. That is spiritual. Don't talk anything else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? How can we give up our enviousness and reluctance to serve the spiritual master and the other devotees?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhrstadyumna:</span> One can free himself from envy by serving. You serve the devotees and follow the instruction of the spiritual master. In this way the mind becomes your best friend.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> A devotee is never envious of another devotee. He is not a devotee. <span class="Italic">Tad-adhīneṣu maitrī.</span> One who is devotee, we have to make friendship with them. How we can hate them?</div>

<div class="Heading">Garden Conversation<br class="calibre2"/>-<br class="calibre2"/>June 27, 1976, New Vrindaban</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So any question from the newcomers?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> This gentleman, he owns this house, Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, I know him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> He mentioned that he met you way back in 1966 in Tompkins Square Park.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. (pause) If you go somewhere, you must know first of all why you have gone there. That is the first question. If you go to a store, the first business is that you have gone to purchase some particular thing from the store. That is understood. Similarly, why one should go to a spiritual master? What is the purpose? Answer any one of you.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> One is..., when one is confused and frustrated by this material existence, he wants to find an answer to his problem. So there are different authorities in the world offering solutions, but one has to find the actual authority.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the purport. <span class="Italic">Tasmād guruṁ prapadyeta jijñāsu śreya uttamam [SB </span>11.3.21]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to go to guru when one is inquisitive. <span class="Italic">Jijñāsu. Jijñāsu</span> means we want to know so many things; that is our nature. Child also wants to know. He asks his parents, "What is this, father? What is this, mother?" That inquisitiveness is there in everyone. So when one wants to know about the Supreme, then he requires a guru, or spiritual master. It is not a fashion that "Everyone keeps a guru; let me also have a guru." Not like that. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> "In order to understand the transcendental science, one has to go to guru." <span class="Italic">Jijñāsu śreya uttamam.</span> After <span class="Italic">artha,...</span> Just like generally, naturally, one goes to temple, church... Four classes of men. One is needy: "O God, give us our daily bread." One thinks... Actually, that is the fact. God gives us bread. So traditionally we are trained up. So we go to God, "Give us our daily bread." Similarly, one who wants to know what is God. Just like in our society, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, they see that these boys, young boys, they have given up everything, they are after Kṛṣṇa. What is this Kṛṣṇa? That is intelligent. Why they are after this Kṛṣṇa? Then he has to go to a person, guru. In this way, there are many circumstances. But the real purpose is to know the Supreme. One who is inquisitive or anxious to know about the Supreme, then there is necessity of guru. Otherwise, what is the use of it? One who is not inquisitive to understand the Supreme, he has no business for a guru. But everyone has necessity to understand the Supreme. That is human life. A dog cannot inquire what is God, because he is dog. But a man can do that. He has got that developed intelligence. So if a man does not inquire about the Supreme Truth, he is no better than a dog. If one does not seek after spiritual master, he's a dog. He's in the standard of dog. Because that inquiry is the particular business of human being, to inquire about the Supreme. If he does not inquire, then still he's on the platform of dog. First of all, you have understood it or not? So any human being with developed intelligence must go to a spiritual master. If he does not go, then he's still in the animal platform. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="calibre3">[MU</span> 1.2.12]<span class="Italic">. Abhigacchet</span> means he must. If he does not, then he is in the animal platform.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? So if one is looking for a guru, but there are many people they are proclaiming themselves guru, and they are speaking "Supreme, God," how may one tell the actual guru?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is, if you want to purchase something, you must know where to purchase. Otherwise, you may be cheated. You, generally, you ask your friend that "I want to purchase some diamond, so can you give me some reliable address where I can go and purchase?" Generally, people do that. So you have to do that. If you want to purchase, you must know the preliminary understanding where diamond can be purchased. And if you are not aware of it, you may be cheated. That preliminary knowledge you must have. That means best thing is, those who are dealing with diamonds, you go there. Just like if anyone is inquisitive to understand God, so best thing is those who are dealing with God only, they have no other business. Then you go there. That is the intelligent. Why should you go to a cheater? This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is especially distributing knowledge about God. So why do they not come here and inquire? First thing is, unless one is inquisitive to understand God, or Absolute Truth, he has no necessity of guru. But if he is actually serious, then he must go to a person where the dealing is only God, that's all. Just like ordinarily, if anyone wants to purchase some share of company, he goes to the share market and he sees the price of different shares, and he selects. So everything requires little intelligence, then it is all right. Otherwise, you may be cheated. Whatever business you do, you must do it intelligently. But if you are foolishly doing something, you may be cheated. Why we are opening so many centers all over the world? We are giving opportunity people to come and understand about God. Why do they not come here? Then he can make his judgment that "Here is the genuine party." And if one accepts some cheap God, that means he has no understanding about God. He's a rascal. If I say I'm God and somebody accepts me as God, then he's a foolish man. They do not know what is meaning of God. If one wants God, he must know at least what is meant by God. Every scripture, just like in Bible it is said "God has created this universe." So if you come to me and accept me as God, why don't you test whether I have created another universe like this? Why you accept a cheap God who hasn't done anything? Simply he's bluff, and he says that "I am God." So why do you accept such God? Hmm? Why should we accept a cheap God? Everything requires intelligence. If you are not intelligent, then every transaction you may be cheated. Everyone has heard God is great. So great means there should be nobody equal to Him and nobody greater than Him. That is greatness. So test that man whether he has no competitor, another God. Nowadays there are so many Gods. So God is great, why there is another competitor? This is intelligence.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Prabhupāda? Can one make progress in Kṛṣṇa consciousness...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. First of all, whatever we are talking you should understand, then bring another question. Don't puzzle. One question decide. Don't make it whimsical dictionary. It is not good. First of all decide one question clearly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> So the bona fide guru does not claim to be God, but he gives knowledge of God, and he only deals with God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is bona fide guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> A very common occurrence in the Western countries, they say that anyone can be guru. In fact, one Westerner who went to India and came back-he's very popular in the United States today-he says that everyone is guru and everyone is God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> And people accept that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Now you discuss this point. Discuss this point.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā...</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all, you discuss this point, everyone is God and everyone is guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Only if one hears from the right authority can one be guru. Spiritual knowledge is descending.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The premise of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> is that there's a creator of everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> There's a creator of everything. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1].</span> Origin of everything. The premise of these so-called spiritual masters...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is a common sense. If everyone is God, then what is the necessity of finding out a guru? Guru means who explains about God. Everyone is God, then what is the use of explanation? There is no need of guru.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> How can God be controlled by His own energy, illusory energy?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So many things. Foolish men can accept that, "Everyone is God, everyone is guru." That is foolish man's proposition and accepted by fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It is explained in <span class="Italic">Back to Godhead</span> magazine that (indistinct) serve Kṛṣṇa, serve God. If someone tells you that he is guru (indistinct).</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> So to accept a spiritual master must mean that one is in ignorance and one is enlightened.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> For ignorance there is no need of guru. An ignorant cannot inquire about God. Intelligent man can inquire about God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Guest:</span> We have to pick up our children. Thank you. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Pick up children from a school? Do you know him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> They're from Wheeling.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Once you said, Śrīla Prabhupāda, "If you are God, what will you do when I kick on your face?" Because if God is creating the sun, such a great planet in the sky, thousands of tons of energy, so if they are the source of the sun, but "What can they do if I kick in their face? Nothing. So how is that God?" Kṛṣṇa, when..., someone was, Paundraka, he was saying he was God, He said, "All right, hold My <span class="Italic">cakra.</span>" And He took off his head. So to these false Gods we can say "What will you do if we kick you in the face? You cannot save yourself."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is the proper treatment. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, there is one common philosophy also held by a lot of religious groups that God can be understood directly from within, and that no guru or spiritual master is necessary. If I desire to approach God, and if He's all-powerful, He can instruct me from within. They feel like this. Therefore they dispute our claim that we understand God in a different way, that you need a genuine spiritual master. And yet when we approach them, one man will say he has God within his heart and he understands God in this way, and another man is receiving instruction from God from within the heart, and yet he's saying another thing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yet, they continue to claim like that, so...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Yes, when God teaches Arjuna... His realization from within should be the same as Kṛṣṇa is teaching to Arjuna. It should be confirmed by <span class="Italic">śāstra.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> He was saying that these people say "God is instructing me from within," but they all have different philosophies.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But he's a rascal, and who accepts him, he's a rascal. How do you think that God is speaking to him? How do you accept it? How do you accept that God is speaking to him?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Well, I don't accept it.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you are advocating. Why do you accept this?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> He would say that he has turned his...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He would say, but you must know that he's talking foolish. How God can talk with him? What is the condition? Therefore you have to read books.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Tad vidhi praṇipātena.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. God talks with whom? That is said. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānaṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> Those who have already become devotee of God and engaged in His service, He talks with him. Not he's a third-class fool. He doesn't talk with him. It is clearly stated, <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānām [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">,</span> one who is twenty-four-hours engaged in the service of the Lord, with love and faith, God talks with him. That is clearly stated. How do you understand that God is talking with him? A rascal fool, who has no business with God? God talks with devotee, very sincere devotee who is already engaged in God's service. He talks with him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> But then he might say "But I love God."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He might say, that is another thing. The standard is this. He may say-he's a rascal, he can say so many nonsense. That is not the standard. He says that "God is talking with me." So I have to see whether he's a candidate with whom God can talk. The formula is <span class="Italic">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">.</span> "One who is twenty-four-hours engaged in My service with love and faith, God talks with him." So first of all see whether he's twenty-four-hours engaged in God's service with love and faith. Then you can understand, "Yes, God is talking with him." But he has no preliminary qualification, if he says "I can talk with God," he's a nonsense. That means because you are a nonsense you are talking about him that God talks with him. You do not know with whom God talks. So you are nonsense also. You accept him, "Yes, he may be talking with God." How he can talk? That means you are also nonsense. You do not know with whom God talks. Why do you accept such proposition? If some store keeper says "I have passed M.A., L.L.D.," and I have to accept that? You must know with whom God talks. That means you are nonsense. You are accepting nonsensically. And the person who is constantly engaged in God's service, unless he's trained up by a spiritual master, how can he be engaged? So without spiritual master, one cannot be engaged in devotional service, and without devotional service, nobody's eligible to talk with God. So that nonsense talking, that without spiritual master God talking, and he has become perfect, this is all nonsense. One who believes, he is also nonsense. He does not know God. To raise such question means nonsense. You do not know with whom God talks, therefore you have brought this question. Otherwise, you would have kicked immediately. It is impossible. What do you think?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I understand what you are saying.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why do you raise this question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> It's a matter of argument also.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Argument? Why do you bring such nonsense argument, waste time? Don't waste time. You are ignorant, you are accepting. Don't remain ignorant. It is common sense. Is it so easy that one can talk with God? If some common man says "Just now I went to Mr. Ford, and talked with him. I'm coming back from him." So any gentleman will believe that? So these are our insufficiency that we believe such things. We are not properly trained up. Simply waste time. That's not good. He may talk nonsense. Why I shall accept nonsense? The same example. If somebody comes, "Now I'm just coming from talking with Mr. Ford, the President." Shall I have to believe? He's a common man. How he can talk with President Ford? If I believe, then I am also nonsense. Where is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> We don't have a fan in here... I have to bring a fan from somewhere else.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, bring, you can bring some soft cloth. Why this is, you bring some soft cloth. So don't indulge such nonsense question. You must personally understand. That is knowledge. If you are reading <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> how you can accept nonsense, he says that "I can talk with Kṛṣṇa without spiritual master." It is absurd proposition. So why you should accept such absurd proposition unless you are also another absurd? If you knew that it is not possible, you "You rascal." Don't talk with him. Don't waste time. But you also do not know with whom God talks. Clearly stated. <span class="Italic">Teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ [Bg. </span>10.10]<span class="Italic">. Teṣām evānukampārtham</span> [Bg. 10.11]<span class="Italic">.</span> Why don't you read all these proposals? With whom God talks? Hmm? Why did you not?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> I'm familiar with those verses.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then why did you not say "God talks with such and such person, but you are not such and such. Why you are talking nonsense? That means you are cheating. But you cannot cheat me. I know." So you must know. You must know with whom God talks.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, does this mean that we should not speak with those who ask such questions?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But you must know how to answer it! Otherwise, chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Why there are so many books? You do not read it, you do not know how to answer it even. That means you do not read. If you knew that God does not speak with rascals or anyone ordinary, then you would have immediately replied, "God does not speak to you. It is not possible. It requires qualification." Why should you believe it and waste your time?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu prays that one should be more tolerant than a tree, devoid of all sense of false prestige. How do we lose that desire for false prestige?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Desire for false prestige? First of all, <span class="Italic">ceto-darpana-mārjanam [Cc. Antya 20.12].</span> The heart is full of so many dirty things, and basically all of these revolve around the bodily concept of life-I think I'm this body. Therefore we're desiring honor, we don't like to be dishonored; and looking for so many gains, we don't like to lose something. So there are so many dualities that exist: respect and disrespect, honor and dishonor. So when you become purified, freed from the bodily concept of life by chanting, then naturally honor and dishonor, they are not very important; they are only in relationship to the body.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Now argue, whether you are satisfied with his answer. If not, say it. In this way, discuss. Are you satisfied with his answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all right.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it says that the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> is the postgraduate study of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm, hear him. What does he say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is the postgraduate study...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> postgraduate study.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> So if we're very attracted to reading <span class="Italic">Caitanya caritāmṛta</span> now, but we haven't finished <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> as yet, should we wait until we have studied <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> thoroughly?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> It does not mean that one who is not postgraduate, he cannot read other books. Spiritual life is not a stereotype like that. But one who is not postgraduate, it is little difficult for him to understand the statement of... Just like in the beginning of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta,</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāj jagati para-tattvaṁ param iha,</span> that there is no superior truth than Caitanya Mahāprabhu. So if you have not studied <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> you'll not understand this statement. If you understand, "Yes, Caitanya is the supreme truth," then it is to be understood that you have graduated. And if you are not, then it will be difficult for you to understand.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> Then the more we understand <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> the more we'll understand the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, and if you understood <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> thoroughly, then you can understand <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> But if you have not understood <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam,</span> then you cannot understand <span class="Italic">Caitanya caritāmṛta.</span> The simple statement, <span class="Italic">na caitanyāt kṛṣṇāt para-tattvaṁ param iha.</span> Where is <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span>?

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Which volume, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First volume. That means you are not reading, you simply are referring. This is the difficulty.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This is the beginning of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta.</span> So will anyone be able to understand this verse? Hmm? Everything is stated there, what is Caitanya. Will everyone be able to understand it? That is the proof that he's not graduate. If he is graduate, then he should understand.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> One must understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> before <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> No, there's no purport to this verse.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda? How does one know when he has the understanding of the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā?</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What does he say? Answer him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> What did you say?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> How does one know when he has the understanding of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> One has understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> who surrenders to Kṛṣṇa, because Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekam śaraṇaṁ vraja</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">,</span> that "The essence of all knowledge is to surrender unto Me, to give up all other duties." So one who takes that instruction as life and soul, he has understood <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Is that all right?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> The same verse again in the Second Chapter."The compilers of the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> speak very highly of the impersonal Brahman. The <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads,</span> which are considered the most elevated portion of the Vedic literatures, are meant for persons who desire to get free from material association and who therefore approach a bona fide spiritual master for enlightenment. The prefix <span class="Italic">upa</span> indicates that one must receive knowledge about the Absolute Truth from a spiritual master. One who has faith in his spiritual master actually receives transcendental instruction, and as his attachment for material life slackens, he is able to advance on the spiritual path. Knowledge of the transcendental science of the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads..."</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Where is that boy? You are hearing?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Yes, Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> "Knowledge of the transcendental science of the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> can free one from the entanglement of existence in the material world, and when thus liberated, one can be elevated to the spiritual kingdom of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by advancement in spiritual life. The beginning of spiritual enlightenment is realization of impersonal Brahman. Such realization is effected by gradual negation of material variegatedness. Impersonal Brahman realization is the partial, distant experience of the Absolute Truth that one achieves through the rational approach. It is compared to one's seeing a hill from a distance and taking it to be a smoky cloud. A hill is not a smoky cloud, but it appears to be one from a distance because of our imperfect vision. In imperfect or smoky realization of the Absolute Truth, spiritual variegatedness is conspicuous by its absence. This experience is therefore called <span class="Italic">advaita-vāda,</span> or realization of the oneness of the Absolute. The impersonal glowing effulgence of Brahman consists only of the personal bodily rays of the Supreme Godhead, Śrī Kṛṣṇa. Since Śrī Gaurasundara, or Lord Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu, is identical with Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself, the Brahman effulgence consists of the rays of His transcendental body. Similarly, the Supersoul, which is called the Paramātmā, is a plenary representation of Caitanya Mahāprabhu. The <span class="Italic">antaryāmi,</span> the Supersoul in everyone's heart, is the controller of all living entities. This is confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>, wherein Lord Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭaḥ:</span> "I am situated in everyone's heart." (Bg. 15.15) <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> also states; <span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">,</span> indicating that the Supreme Lord, acting in His expansion as the Supersoul, is the proprietor of everything. Similarly, the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> states, <span class="Italic">aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham: [Bs. </span>5.35] the Lord is present everywhere within the heart of every living entity and within each and every atom as well. Thus by this Supersoul feature the Lord is all-pervading. Furthermore, Lord Caitanya is also the master of all wealth, strength, fame, beauty, knowledge and renunciation because He is Śrī Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is described as <span class="Italic">pūrṇa,</span> or complete. In the feature of Lord Caitanya, the Lord is an ideal renouncer, just as Śrī Rāma was an ideal king. He accepted the order of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> and exemplified exceedingly wonderful principles in His own life. No one can compare to Him in the order of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> Although in <span class="Italic">Kali-yuga</span> acceptance of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> order is generally forbidden, Lord Caitanya accepted it because He is complete in renunciation. Others cannot imitate Him but can only follow in His footsteps as far as possible. Those who are unfit for this order of life are strictly forbidden by the injunctions of the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> to accept it. Lord Caitanya, however, is complete in renunciation as well as all other opulences. He is therefore the highest principle of the Absolute Truth. By an analytical study of the truth of Lord Caitanya, one will find that He is not different from the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa; no one is greater than or even equal to Him. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa says to Arjuna, <span class="Italic">mattaḥ parataraṁ nānyat kiñcid asti dhanañjaya: [Bg. </span>7.7] 'O conquerer of wealth (Arjuna), there is no truth superior to Me.' Thus it is here confirmed that there is no truth higher than Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa Caitanya. The impersonal Brahman is the goal of those who cultivate the study of books of transcendental knowledge, and the Supersoul is the goal of those who perform the yoga practices. One who knows the Supreme Personality of Godhead surpasses realization of both Brahman and Paramātmā, because Bhagavān is the ultimate platform of absolute knowledge. The Personality of Godhead is the complete form of sac-cidananda (full life, knowledge and bliss). By realization of the <span class="Italic">sat</span> portion of the Complete Whole (unlimited existence), one realizes the impersonal Brahman of the Lord. By realization of the <span class="Italic">cit</span> portion of the Complete Whole (unlimited knowledge) one can realize the localized aspect of the Lord, Paramātmā. But neither of these partial realizations of the Complete Whole can help one realize <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> or complete bliss. Without such realization of <span class="Italic">ānanda,</span> knowledge of the Absolute Truth is incomplete. This verse of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> by Kṛṣṇadāsa Kavirāja Gosvāmī is confirmed by a parallel statement in the <span class="Italic">Tattva-sandarbha</span> by Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī. In the Eighth Part of <span class="Italic">Tattva-sandarbha</span> it is said that the Absolute Truth is sometimes approached as impersonal Brahman, which, although spiritual, is only a partial representation of the Absolute Truth. Nārāyaṇa, the predominating Deity in Vaikuṇṭha, is to be known as an expansion of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, but Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Absolute Truth, the object of the transcendental love of all living entities."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So is it clear? (laughs) It is not so easy. Therefore it is postgraduate.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Can these things be understood theoretically, Śrīla Prabhupāda, or is realization required?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Realization required. What is the use of theoretical knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, can realization be had through service without theoretical understanding?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> This whole science is understood through service only. Everything becomes revealed. <span class="Italic">Sevonmukhe hi jihvādau svayam eva sphuraty adaḥ</span> [BRS. 1.2.234]<span class="Italic">.</span> Revelation. Everything is revelation. Unless one is very sincere servant, there is no revelation.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, it described a gradual process of realizing Kṛṣṇa, but does the devotee go through these levels of understanding Brahman then Paramātmā then Bhagavān? Does the devotee gradually go through these levels, or does he immediately realize Brahman when his service is perfect?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That depends on his capacity. (directing someone:) Just on the head of the...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> Mahārāja Kīrtanānanda said that our actual realization comes through our actions. So we are building this New Vrindaban we are, actually..., this is taken to be our preaching or our life and soul.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> What is your question?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (2):</span> My question is how do we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (3):</span> Prabhupāda, his question is will one become realized by continually engaging in devotional service under the direction of a bona fide representative of the spiritual master?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> The question is that his service is here in New Vrindaban under Kīrtanānanda Mahārāja. Will serving the representative of the spiritual master..., is that as good as serving the spiritual master? Will it get the same result?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> I don't think that was the question. No? At least, I understand the question to be: Is service to the Supreme Lord the same as realization of the Absolute Truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> That is the Absolute Truth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Puṣṭa Kṛṣṇa:</span> Is service to the Supreme Lord the same as realization of the Absolute Truth?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. Absolute means there is no difference. Kṛṣṇa and Kṛṣṇa's service, same. So discuss it further.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> Is that to say that if one-<span class="Italic">brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">]</span>-that if one simply goes on serving, engaging in all sorts of different activities for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, but he never, in this lifetime at least, has realization of Brahman, Paramātmā or Bhagavān...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is the difficulty? Everything is explained. By seeing the sun one can understand the sunshine, the sun globe and the sun-god. There are three things. Within the sun globe, there is the sun-god. It is stated in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, imaṁ vivasvate yogaṁ proktavān aham avyayam:</span> [Bg. 4.1] "I spoke to Vivasvata." So there is a person Vivasvata, and the globe is there, we see, and the sunshine is there. So what is the difficulty to understand? Three things are there. The person within the sun globe, Vivasvata, is there, otherwise how Kṛṣṇa could speak with him? He says, <span class="Italic">imaṁ vivasvate yogam,</span> "unto Vivasvata I spoke." So there is a person. And we can see the globe, and we can see the sunshine. Is there any difficulty? So similarly, the Brahman is the sunshine, light, and Paramātmā is the sun globe, and Bhagavān is the sun-god. This is, the sun is one example. From this example, we can understand the Absolute. Where is the difficulty? (aside:) Sit down properly. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate [SB </span>1.2.11<span class="Italic">].</span> As heat and light, all of them are the same... In the sunshine there is heat and light, in the sun globe there is heat and light, and within the sun globe there is heat and light, but the temperature is different. You can tolerate the heat and light of the sunshine, but if you go to the sun globe you'll be finished. Temperature's so high, it requires a special qualification. Similarly, from heat and light point of view, Brahman, Paramātmā, Bhagavān, the same. Everywhere there is heat and light, but the temperature is different. So one who understands Brahman, he cannot understand Paramātmā. He understands, but not as thoroughly. Similarly, one who understands Paramātmā, he can (not) understand Bhagavān, but if you understand Bhagavān, then you understand Paramātmā, Brahman, everything.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulaśekhara:</span> So we should simply try to understand Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. No. Try to understand everything, but understanding Kṛṣṇa, you understand everything. <span class="Italic">Yasmin vijñāte sarvam eva vijñātaṁ bhavanti.</span> And because you do not understand Kṛṣṇa, therefore you do not understand Brahman, you do not understand Paramātmā. But if you understand Kṛṣṇa, then it is automatically understood. We have not understood Brahman, Paramātmā, because we have not understood Kṛṣṇa properly. Kṛṣṇa says, <span class="Italic">aham sarvasya prabhavaḥ [Bg. </span>10.8]<span class="Italic">,</span> "I am the source of everything." So Brahman is also from Kṛṣṇa, Paramātmā is also from Kṛṣṇa. And so other Bhagavāns-there are so many Bhagavāns also-they are from Kṛṣṇa. So if you understand Kṛṣṇa you can understand everything. And as soon as you say that you have not understood it, therefore you have not understood Kṛṣṇa. They cannot understand, just like Māyāvādīs, they do not understand Kṛṣṇa, therefore they do not understand Brahman also. And therefore they fall down, because they have not understood either Brahman or Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Patanty adhaḥ.</span> This is stated in the <span class="Italic">śāstra. Anādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ,</span> because they have not understood Kṛṣṇa, even they have gone up to the Brahman, they cannot stand there; they fall down. Again they come to the material world. The Māyāvādīs, they say, <span class="Italic">brahma satyma jagan mithyā,</span> "Brahman is truth, and this material world is false." They take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> but after some time they fall down, again take to other businesses than Brahman in the material world. Just like our Vivekananda. He came to the Western countries to preach <span class="Italic">Vedānta,</span> and he has advertised that "Whole America has become Vedantist." The proof of <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> is when he returned to India he became very enthusiastic to open hospitals like the Christian missionaries. So if the material world is false, so why he's trying to open hospitals? <span class="Italic">Brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā. Jagat</span> is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> So why in the <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> platform he's taking credit by opening hospitals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Well, as long as people are suffering, they can't realize that they are God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> So you cannot stop the suffering. You are unable. You are also suffering from the same disease. So don't say that <span class="Italic">jagat mithyā.</span> If they are suffering, that's a fact. Then how do you say it is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> it is false? If it is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> then why you are affected by the suffering? There are so many questions. That means not realization. Contradictory. If you feel the suffering, then why you call it <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>? It is fact. Why do you say it is <span class="Italic">mithyā?</span> That means you have no realization. You are accepting suffering as <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> We say suffering is not <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> it is fact, but if you want to save from suffering, then you get out of this material world. We don't say that, that suffering is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> or this world is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> We don't say that. We are offering this flower to Kṛṣṇa, not as <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>; it is a means of service. Why shall I say it is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>? By offering... Kṛṣṇa says <span class="Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati [</span>Bg. 9.26]<span class="Italic">.</span> By offering a little flower. How can I say this is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>? Māyāvādī's philosophy, it is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> With <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> we can approach the <span class="Italic">satya</span>? By hundreds of false we can make one truth? Kṛṣṇa says that "If you offer Me a little flower," so how can I say this is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>? It is not <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> It is <span class="Italic">satya.</span> When it is <span class="Italic">satya</span>? When it is offered to Kṛṣṇa. And when you take it for your sense gratification, that is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> That is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> You cannot enjoy it. If you enjoy it, then go to hell. If you offer it to Kṛṣṇa, you go to Him. So how can I say it is <span class="Italic">mithyā</span>? You cannot approach Kṛṣṇa with something <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> Then Kṛṣṇa becomes <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> There are so many things to be studied. We don't say like that. We find there is relationship of Kṛṣṇa with everything. When we find this beautiful rose, we find the intelligence of Kṛṣṇa. By Kṛṣṇa's intelligence it has come out so nice, fragrant, beautiful. They say it is made by nature. That is nonsense. Kṛṣṇa's says <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram [Bg. 9.10].</span> So under Kṛṣṇa's direction nature has made it so beautiful. That is a fact. Therefore I find there is hand of Kṛṣṇa in this flower. So Kṛṣṇa has made this, this is Kṛṣṇa's property, it should be offered to Kṛṣṇa. That is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> We are not offering something <span class="Italic">mithyā</span> to Kṛṣṇa. It is fact.</div>
<div class="Verse">prāpañcikatayā buddhyā<br class="calibre2"/>hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ<br class="calibre2"/>mumukṣubhiḥ parityago<br class="calibre2"/>phalgu vairāgyaṁ kathyate</div>
<div class="Purp-para">It is made by Kṛṣṇa. If you say, "No, no, I don't touch this flower," so what is credit there? You have not prepared it. You touch or not touch, it doesn't matter. If you say, "No, no, it is material. I don't touch." You may not touch it, but you do not know it is not material, it is spiritual, it is made by Kṛṣṇa. So you have to study deeply. Everything is... <span class="Italic">Ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo</span> [Bg. 10.8]<span class="Italic">.</span> Kṛṣṇa says, "I am the source of everything." So the flower is also from Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1],</span> from whom everything is emanating. The flower is also within the everything. How can I say it is false? This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, you said we can't understand Brahman unless we understand Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is real understanding. And without Kṛṣṇa, if you understand <span class="Italic">brahma satyaṁ jagan mithyā,</span> then you fall down.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> But it seems then you have to come to the full understanding before it does any good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. That means those who are simply trying to understand Brahman, they are not understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Kulādri:</span> Then what does it mean gradual process, gradual advancement in transcendental realization?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Gradual process, just like you are here in the sunshine. So if you are intelligent, you'll understand that the temperature in the sunshine and the temperature in the sun globe is different. So Brahman understanding is the lowest stage. Paramātmā understanding little higher. And Bhagavān understanding is complete. That is gradual. And these Māyāvādīs, they do not try to understand Kṛṣṇa. They are satisfied only with understanding Brahman. Therefore they fall down. <span class="Italic">Arūhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho 'nādṛta [SB </span>10.2.32]<span class="Italic">.</span> Because there is no standing. The impersonal feature, that the sky... Go very high in the sky, you do not see anymore this planet earth, neither you see anything, you'll be mad. Then you will find out how to go back again. You cannot stay there in that condition. Although they say <span class="Italic">"so'ham,"</span> no, you cannot stay there. Just imagine, if you go very high and you do not see any other thing, only sky. Will you be able to stay in that condition? You go in the sea. When you do not find anything, all water, you become very much anxious, "Where is land? Where is land?" And as soon as you have a glimpse of land, island, you become very, "Oh, there is land." So this is impersonal understanding. It is simply imagination, that simply by Brahman understanding he'll be happy. No, that is not possible.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, then even Brahman has to be understood in relationship to Kṛṣṇa?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Even Brahman has to be understood...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes, that is real understanding.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> <span class="Italic">Brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hmm. Now wherefrom this fragrance have come?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> From the earth.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Get out this fragrance from earth, you scientist. By Kṛṣṇa's manipulation here is fragrance. Everyone knows it has come from earth. If there is, in the earth, there is no such fragrance, wherefrom it came? So therefore it is there, it is understood, but you get it out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Well, we can take the chemicals and mix them, produce fragrance.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Take the chemicals?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes. We can analyze the chemical structure and make...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, the flower has taken directly, without any chemical addition. You do that. It is a fact the flavor is there within the earth, you take the flavor, extract the flavor. Not only this flavor, there are different flavors, all, everything there. There are so many flowers coming out. Huh? <span class="Italic">Sarva-kāma dugha-mahī. Mahī</span> means earth. Everything's coming out from the earth. But not in your attempt. It is Kṛṣṇa's attempt that He can take out. Out of so many different flavors, everything is there within the earth, but Kṛṣṇa's manipulation takes the different colors, different flavors, different bodies, everything. That is Kṛṣṇa's manipulation. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10].</span> Just like in our kitchen we have got the ingredients, rice, <span class="Italic">dahl, āṭṭā, ghee.</span> But the expert can prepare hundreds of preparations. That expert is Kṛṣṇa. And if one is not expert, even the ingredients are there, he'll spoil everything. He'll mix the <span class="Italic">āṭṭā</span> with water then put <span class="Italic">ghee</span> and then put rice. (laughter) This is the... We have to become expert. If you become expert, then you'll do very nice <span class="Italic">purī, dahl,</span> rice, ah... There are so many varieties. You enjoy. And if you are not expert, you'll spoil. So Kṛṣṇa is expert and Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is expert because he takes lessons from Kṛṣṇa. So for them this is not <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> Rascals who spoil it, they think it is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span> He could not do anything. He mix with a conglomeration, and because he could not get any result, he said <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> disappointment. And one who knows, he knows how to utilize it. Just like we are utilizing the cows in so many nice preparations, and these rascals killing them. Finished.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> And then they want to say that this is <span class="Italic">mithyā,</span> that Kṛṣṇa consciousness is <span class="Italic">mithyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever they say, practically see.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Yes. They do not know how to use the cow, only kill.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (4):</span> You said that is the sour grape philosophy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Grape philosophy, what is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Hari-śauri:</span> Sour grape.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> The fox...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Ah.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> ...wanted to taste the grapes, but he couldn't, so he said they are no good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You do not know expert. So if we remain under the guidance of Kṛṣṇa, then we also become expert to some extent. And Kṛṣṇa's expertly service or intelligence we can see in the flower, so many flowers. So why shall I not take shelter of Kṛṣṇa? <span class="Italic">Sarva-dharmān parityajya</span> [Bg. 18.66]<span class="Italic">.</span> That is intelligence. That is intelligence. We see Kṛṣṇa's expertly manipulation. So if we take Kṛṣṇa's shelter, at least we shall get little intelligence. <span class="Italic">Dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ tam.</span> "He gets the intelligence directly from Me." And that is wanted. Why it is foolishly dealing with this rice, <span class="Italic">dahl</span> and make spoil everything? Be little expert from Kṛṣṇa's instructions and make everything nice. Kṛṣṇa personally teaches how to deal with cows. He never showed the example of killing the cows. He maintained the cows, the calf. He was distributing butter even to the monkeys. And the pasturing ground became muddy on account of milk dropping from the bags. This is Kṛṣṇa. And He is personally taking care. So why the Kṛṣṇa's devotees should not do it? Give protection to the cows and utilize the milk. That is one of the items of Kṛṣṇa consciousness. We are not keeping hogs and dogs. We are keeping cows, because we are Kṛṣṇa conscious. Kṛṣṇa did not keep so many dogs as nowadays so many big, big men, they are keeping dogs. Kṛṣṇa did not do so. If we follow Kṛṣṇa's instruction, then we are perfect. Practical example. We have not invent. If we simply follow what Kṛṣṇa has instructed us, then we become perfect.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> How can we perfectly follow only what Kṛṣṇa has said? The other evening you said that the patient he is always a fool and a rascal.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Answer him.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> But one should not remain a fool and a rascal. If the doctor has given the formula, you have to follow it. He says don't eat this but stay in bed, sleep so much. You have to do it, otherwise you will stay sick.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You'll remain a rascal if you don't follow the instruction. So what do you want? You remain a rascal or make advance? What you want? Huh?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (5):</span> To become advanced.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Then follow. If you willfully remain a rascal, that is the difference. Otherwise, if you follow you'll become advanced. Everywhere you'll find Kṛṣṇa's intelligence. He says <span class="Italic">mayādhyakṣeṇa [Bg. 9.10].</span> They explain, "Nature." But they cannot explain what is nature. We can explain. Nature is a system which is being handled by Kṛṣṇa. That is real understanding. Nature, we can see that from nature this flower is coming, this flower is coming. But why not...? They say accidentally. If it is accident, why in the plant of this flower sometimes rose is not coming accidentally? And why from the rose plant not accidentally this flower is coming? So where is the question of accident? You have never experienced such accident. The same plant, the same flower is coming. Where is a proof by accident another flower has come? Where is the proof? So why do they say like that, accident?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Because they don't want to accept God.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, accept God or not, where the accident theory comes?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dhṛṣṭadyumna:</span> Well if they don't give <span class="Italic">some</span> explanation, then they'll be considered fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Some explanation, they have to give you something foolish explanation? So foolish man will accept that, not a sane man. If you say "By accident," then I'll say why not accident in the history of the world there is a rose plant some other flower has come out? If man has come from monkey, why not coming now? So they give so may foolish propositions, only fools will accept. Anyone who has a little reasoning power they will not, they'll understand that these are all crazy fellows, talking all nonsense. <span class="Italic">Harāv abhaktasya kuto mahad-guṇāḥ.</span> We have got little formula to understand that if one is not Kṛṣṇa conscious he has no good qualifications. He cannot say anything as a qualified person. That is the test. <span class="Italic">Mūḍha.</span> Immediately take: a <span class="Italic">mūḍha.</span> Let the <span class="Italic">mūḍhas</span> speak all nonsense. Why should we waste our time? This is Kṛṣṇa consciousness. As soon as we find somebody not Kṛṣṇa conscious, not a devotee of Kṛṣṇa, we take, reject, he's a rascal, that's all. And he is rascal. Not only blindly we are rejecting, but with reason. (end)</div>
