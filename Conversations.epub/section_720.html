<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Are the animals complacent with their hellish condition of life?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Animal?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Yes. Like the dog. Is he happy to be a dog?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prahupada:</span> Yes. Everyone is happy.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> There is one story in regard to this, sir... [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The answer? You have got the answer?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> Excuse me?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> No. He was not. He was not attentive. I answered on his behalf with that story.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Once that happened to Indra, isn't it, Śrīla Prabhupāda?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Anyone, in any condition of life, he thinks that he is happy. That is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> If all the five holes of <span class="Italic">indriyas</span> are made to look outside, get our pleasure from out, if they have turned within and get pleasure from yourself, then you are happy. That is in <span class="Italic">Kaṭhopaniṣad.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> You can see practically. People are living in, what is called, that zone, where everything is ice?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> The North Pole.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> They are thinking happy. They do not come out.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Eskimos.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I have got practical experience. In my childhood I used to go with my father for some purchasing some <span class="Italic">bhauma</span>(?) flour in the interior districts. So there was one servant engaged. One day he did not come. So my father asked me, "He is living in there, in that cottage. You can go and ask him." So I went to his cottage. Practically there was no roof, and rain was dropping. So I saw him in a very bad condition. Then I asked him, "Why don't you come to Calcutta with us?" So he replied, "No sir, we cannot go, leaving home. (laughter) This is home." I have got practical experience. "Home sweet home." <span class="Italic">Janani janma-bhumiś ca svargād api gariyasi:</span> Everyone is thinking that his birthplace and his mother is better than the heaven. That is the psychology. So everyone, however abominable... Everyone is living in abominable condition. That's a fact. But everyone is thinking that "Who is happier than me?" Everyone. This is called <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Unless he thinks, he cannot live.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What is the throwing potency of <span class="Italic">māyā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> It is described that there are two potencies of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Mam eva prapadyante māyām etan taranti te.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotee (1):</span> What is an example of the throwing potency of <span class="Italic">māyā</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throwing potency means somebody comes to take Kṛṣṇa consciousness and <span class="Italic">māyā</span> will dictate, "Why you have come here? Go and enjoy life outside." And he goes away. That is throwing.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Crying?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Throwing, that gets him out. This is throwing. And this is called... What is called? The Sanskrit? <span class="Italic">Prakṣepatmika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṣeka</span>?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Prakṣepatmika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Oh, <span class="Italic">prakṣepatmika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. And another is <span class="Italic">avaranatmika.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Avarana.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Avarana.</span> He is in the most abominable condition, and he is thinking he is very happy. This is <span class="Italic">avaranatmika,</span> covering him to see in the real position. Otherwise we are asking everyone that "You come here. I am giving you room. Take <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa. Read these books." "No. Why shall I come?" What is the difficulty here? But nobody will come. He will rot in the home-anxiety-how to maintain, how to... This is going on. This is called <span class="Italic">prakṣepatmika, avaranātmika.</span> He will prefer rotting as hog and dog, but he will never prefer to live as Kṛṣṇa conscious. This is <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> So many people are there on the beach. You invite them, "Please come to our place. Live nicely. We shall give you nice room, nice <span class="Italic">prasādam.</span> Chant Hare Kṛṣṇa." Nobody will come.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> It is good that they are not coming. Otherwise you won't have this place...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no. We have enough place. We are not depending on Dr. Patel, but Kṛṣṇa. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Devotees:</span> <span class="Italic">Haribol! Haribol!</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You rate me very badly.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, because you are saying like that. You do not know that I started this business without nothing, you see, with practical nothing. I offered Mr. Nair that "I will give you two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> and the balance I'll give you in three years." So who will believe? "He is a beggar, and he promises to give me fifteen <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> of rupees within three years." Who will believe that? He knew that "He will not be able to pay. So whatever two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> three <span class="Italic">lakhs</span> he gives, that will be mine. That's all. <span class="Italic">Bas.</span>" And I was thinking, "He is such a nice gentleman that he will take money, little, little, and I will collect and pay. He is a nice gentleman," I was thinking. And he was thinking, "He's a great fool, (laughter) that he is offering me two <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> three <span class="Italic">lakhs,</span> and he will never be able to pay me balance." So this was the transaction beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> He had made such transaction before also, I think.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. He knew that. I thought, "He is a very nice man. He'll take money one after another, so let me take it." This was the beginning.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think he died before you completed the transaction. He died, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> So both Jagamanta, Hapebo,(?) all of them I will one day drive and then you'll...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But as soon as they will not get tea, they will go away. You may bring all the Bombay residents, and when they will see there is no tea, they will go away. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nayanābhirāma:</span> Śrīla Prabhupāda, that happened in Vṛndāvana once.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> I know that. That is the trouble.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> They would not stay in the guesthouse because they could not make their tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Nayanābhirāma:</span> He said, "Without tea I cannot live." So he went away.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Where? Here this Vṛndāvana?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, that I have allowed, that they can make their own tea.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> You don't allow the tea here in the...?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Brahmānanda:</span> They can make their own tea. There's a special area for that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Many of these boys must have taking tea in past. How they could stop it?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What is that?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Many of them must be taking...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, no, no.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Not now, before.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Oh, before they are taking anything. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> How could they stop it? By virtue of the strength of the mind. That man, if he has got no strength of mind, he should not...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is Kṛṣṇa conscious. The government spent millions of dollars to stop LSD habit. But when they come to me, I say, "You cannot do it." They immediately stopped. Therefore U.S. government is sympathetic to this movement. They are surprised how these drug-addicted men are becoming servant of Kṛṣṇa. One Dr. Judah, he has written a book about us, that the "wonderful..."</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> LSD begets a condition of the mind just like...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Whatever it may be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> ...<span class="Italic">nirakalpa-samādhi.</span> One man told me that's a very good... (laughing) I say we...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That is another nonsense. Nonsense. Fools.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Nirakalpa-samādhi.</span> But they must be getting some sort of condition of the mind, though temporary. That is why they must have turned to that, no?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> There is no consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Were you having the experience?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> First of all you must give it up. Our philosophy is first of all you must give it up, all these bad habits.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is the first condition among Vaiṣṇavas, that they should not have any of these, neither...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Illicit sex, then meat-eating. (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. <span class="Italic">Jaya. Jaya. Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> ...leaving the four sinful activities. Then one can develop Kṛṣṇa consciousness.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No, this is practicing. This is practicing. Unless one is... <span class="Italic">Yeṣam tu anta-gataṁ pāpam.</span> Unless one is free from sinful activities, one cannot understand God. It is not possible. God is not so cheap.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Practice and <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> both are necessary, not only <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> No?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Hm?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Practice and <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> both are necessary.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> means when you are not addicted to sinful life. That is <span class="Italic">vairāgya.</span> People have got attachment for sinful activities. [break] ...<span class="Italic">deve bhagavati bhakti-yoga-prayojitaḥ, janayaty aśu vairāgyam.</span> That is the <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> way. You cannot practice <span class="Italic">vairāgya</span> without Vasudeva's shelter.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Vairāgya</span> generates by extreme <span class="Italic">bhakti</span> or by extreme knowledge. Not otherwise. Knowledge is generated by <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> no doubt, but then you must have complete knowledge of what is this and what is that.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Without <span class="Italic">bhakti,</span> knowledge is artificial, because knowledge means to accept the Supreme Lord as Supreme. That is knowledge.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> That is knowledge. And then this is also... From that knowledge, when you know that this is all false, then it sort of, in a sense, generated within you, to be...</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That knowledge is described in the <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā, māyayāpahṛta-jñānā.</span> The so-called knowledge is useless. It has no value. <span class="Italic">māyāyapahṛta-jñāna.</span> What is the test? <span class="Italic">Na māṁ prapadyante:</span> "If he had knowledge, he would have surrendered to Me," but he does not do so.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">Jñānavan māṁ prapadyante.</span> That is knowledge. <span class="Italic">Jñāna</span> means knowledge. That knowledge is the Supreme.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> But that knowledge means actually <span class="Italic">jñānavān.</span> Otherwise it is false knowledge. <span class="Italic">māyāyapahṛta-jñāna.</span> If you do not know what is God, then what is the meaning of your knowledge?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> You explain in the <span class="Italic">Gītā</span> that</div>
<div class="Verse">bahunam janmanam ante<br class="calibre2"/>jñānavān mam prapadyante<br class="calibre2"/>vasudevaḥ sarvam iti<br class="calibre2"/>sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ<br class="calibre2"/><span class="Italic"> [Bg. </span>7.19]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> (aside) Hare Kṛṣṇa. That is knowledge. Therefore so many <span class="Italic">mahātmās, sādhus, yogis,</span> they are all useless, all useless because they have no <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Simply artificially cheating people. [break] This is a society of cheaters and cheated. If you want to be cheated, there are many cheaters who will come and cheat you. That's all.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Just like the Guru Maharaj-ji. Now the mother is denouncing. She is saying he is no more qualified to be Bhagavān. Now his brother, he is Bhagavān.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> That's all, anyway, a third class.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I think we should not talk about this. Talk something about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhagavat.</span> Then, sir?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Yes. These people are third-class men. Hare Kṛṣṇa.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> <span class="Italic">māyām etan taranti te</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> <span class="Italic">Jaya.</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa. [break] ...explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> Unfortunately the rascals will not take it. That is the difficulty.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> In my time, when, your time, I mean our time, in the school there was a compulsion of learning the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata</span> and <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa.</span> Now these modern principals,(?) they don't know anything about it. Absolutely there is no knowledge. My daughter said, "What is <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span>?" I had to look at a English edition of <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa</span> and give her <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span> That is what they are teaching now in the schools. So this race is going bankrupt. What about knowing about <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and <span class="Italic">Bhāgavata</span>? They don't know simple <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> [break] ...city one house with twenty rooms on the riverside.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I was told that Lasteri's house, you know, sir, Charpak Lasteri.(?)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> What do you think will be the price?</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I don't know about price, sir. But their prices are as high as in Bombay. Whose is this house? Who is the owner? [break]</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...<span class="Italic">jīvanti.</span> The trees, they live many, many hundreds of thousands of years more than men.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian man (1):</span> Yes.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> Does it mean he is sinless? (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> He's a good man. They are doing good. They are doing good.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> He is... It is most condemned life, the trees. They cannot move one inch. They have to suffer all these natural disturbances. One who is too much sinful, he is condemned to stand up here for five thousand years.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Indian (1):</span> (Hindi)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Dvaraka, sir. They had a plan to go to Dvaraka.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> We can go by train to Braman. (?)</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> ...like this place. And I have seen London, New York. (laughter)</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> I have not seen Hardwar myself.</div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Bhāgavata:</span> Hardwar, there is also very new <span class="Italic">āśrama</span> that was built up there only a few years ago called Africa <span class="Italic">āśrama,</span> in Hardwar. And the <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> there is very well known to me and he also said any time you come you can stay there at his place. Very nice <span class="Italic">āśrama.</span></div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> The magistrate is the president of the <span class="Italic">maṭha.</span></div>
<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Dr. Patel:</span> Dvaraka temple was under control of Mahārāja of Baroda, but he appointed a committee of Vaiṣṇavas to control it. It was completely free. [break] (laughing) You have been very unkind to people.</div>

<div class="Purp-para"><span class="Bold">Prabhupāda:</span> No. That is not the question.
